1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,838
The evil souls that try to sabotage
a girl's dream to become thin.

2
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:10,305
That's unforgivable!

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:17,204
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

6
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,620
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

8
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,568
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

9
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

10
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

12
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,483
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,348
I'm a Cancer. My blood type is O and
my birthstone is the pearl.

15
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:05,150
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

16
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,330
One day, a strange black cat
named Luna appeared

17
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,457
and made me into a sailor warrior.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,965
But she wants me to fight bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,637
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:30,875
Usagi Will Teach You
How to Lose Weight!

21
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:53,339
I've gained weight. I'm fat!

22
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:58,881
Oh, it's okay. It's healthier to be a bit
chubby when you are young.

23
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,182
That's right.

24
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:03,152
Sis, you do eat a lot.

25
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,620
It might be that you don't exercise.

26
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,355
And she doesn't study; just eats a lot.

27
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:10,215
Of course you're gonna gain weight!

28
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,822
You don't have to say that much.

29
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:21,025
Crying is not going to help. You'll just
have to eat less from now on.

30
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,238
And get some exercise.

31
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:28,171
Umm, what are you drawing?

32
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,042
You in six months.

33
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:37,446
Luna, I'm going to get you!

34
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,523
What is it?

35
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,235
Oh, it's nothing!

36
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,566
Usagi!

37
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:59,538
If you already finished your lunch,
you can have this too.

38
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,433
It's good.

39
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:03,902
Well, uh...

40
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:07,917
Oh, so you're on a diet.

41
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:08,651
Yeah...

42
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,184
I understand. I'm having
a hard time too!
Yeah...

43
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:12,642
I understand. I'm having
a hard time too!

44
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:14,712
We know.

45
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:18,417
Hey, Usagi. Why don't you try
swimming? You'll get pretty thin.

46
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:22,294
No, she can't swim that well.

47
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,599
Oh...

48
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,635
I've tried fasting and just
eating pineapple.

49
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,796
But the effect doesn't last that long.

50
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:31,106
I've tried several things, you know.

51
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,733
We know.

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,175
Losing weight by falling in love
would be the ideal diet.

53
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,615
Have you ever been in love?

54
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:40,946
No.

55
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:42,879
We know.

56
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,414
Right?

57
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,655
Hey, what do you mean?

58
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:50,726
It's okay. We can't help the way
we were born.

59
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,024
You're the last person I wanted
to hear that from.

60
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,330
What?!

61
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,059
You want to fight?!

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,902
Speaking of diets, Ms. Haruna got
really thin all of a sudden.

63
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,305
Really! How?

64
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,533
I don't know.

65
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,870
Hello everyone.

66
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,309
She doesn't look that much thinner.

67
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,223
You can't tell because she's
wearing clothes.

68
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:22,825
Look at these.

69
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,627
This is the before...

70
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,460
and this is the after. See?

71
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,727
Wow.

72
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:32,233
And in just two days.

73
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,270
Umino, how did you get
these pictures?

74
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,465
Oh, that's top secret.

75
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:39,808
You didn't...

76
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,243
Didn't what?

77
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:43,302
How did you take these pictures?

78
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:44,513
Say it!

79
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,114
Tell us!
Say it!

80
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:45,808
Tell us!

81
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,584
Wait!

82
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,415
Hey, Umino!

83
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,122
I shouldn't have said anything.

84
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:58,827
Tell me.

85
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:01,196
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

86
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:04,066
I followed Haruna and secretly took
those pictures with my camera.

87
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:08,901
No, not about that.
Where is this gym located?

88
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,331
Huh?

89
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,741
[Shapely]

90
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,744
[Shapely]
This is it. This is the gym
that Haruna goes to.

91
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:18,480
[Shapely]
But isn't it expensive to join a gym?

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,615
[Shapely]
Oh look, it's Rie Gotou, the actress.

93
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,480
Oh look, it's Rie Gotou, the actress.

94
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:23,778
She's so cute.

95
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,993
One kilogram a day, five kilograms
in two days.

96
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:33,461
If you go for three days, you too
will be beautiful.

97
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,229
Come on everyone, time to shape up.

98
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:41,203
Right now at Gym Shapely, we're
having free introductory memberships.

99
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:42,693
What, free?

100
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,802
Nothing is cheaper than free.

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,507
Let's go!

102
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,874
Here comes more stupid prey.

103
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:55,377
Nothing costs more than
something that's free.

104
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,321
It was a good thing we brought
our gym clothes.

105
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,845
Here we go. Let's go get'em!

106
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,362
Welcome to Gym Shapely.

107
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,803
Wow, he's gorgeous.

108
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,168
He's so cute.

109
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,207
I'm the instructor here.

110
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:24,735
Um, we're new here.

111
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,479
Please come this way.

112
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,392
Okay, one more time.

113
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,605
Okay, now 10% faster.

114
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:50,867
Wha...?!

115
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,809
One sweat for two kilograms.
Two sweats for five kilograms.

116
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:57,074
Three sweats and you too will be
beautiful. Now try harder.

117
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:02,084
Hey! Where's Usagi?

118
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:05,611
Huh? She was doing the rowing
machine until just a minute ago.

119
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:10,558
You over there. If you stop,
you won't get beautiful.

120
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,761
That's too bad, you're off
to a good start.

121
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:17,198
Yes! Beautiful. Will be beautiful!

122
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,398
Okay, that's it for today!

123
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,109
You did well, everyone.

124
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:30,510
Finally, we'll have you all showered
by our Shape Ray.

125
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,114
Shape Ray?

126
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:33,949
Bubble Bath Room

127
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,818
Bubble Bath Room
Oh, I'm exhausted!

128
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:36,182
Oh, I'm exhausted!

129
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,758
It's hard to lose weight.

130
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,428
I'm hungry.

131
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:01,400
You'll get inside these.

132
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:03,473
What!?

133
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,781
If you are exposed to the
Shape Ray for five minutes...

134
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,616
You, the chubby one,
will lose ten kilograms.

135
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,449
Even you who's thinner can lose
three kilograms right away.

136
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:14,556
Now I get it. This is how Haruna
got so thin in one day.

137
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:15,724
I'm going in.

138
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:16,425
Me too!

139
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:16,992
Me too!
So will I!

140
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:17,720
So will I!

141
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,631
With the energy of these young girls...

142
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,360
Jadeite.

143
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,435
Queen Beryl. I am here.

144
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,331
How are the preparations?

145
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,511
Do not worry. The energy of
the young humans

146
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,706
is steadily being collected.

147
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:15,480
Good, proceed as planned.

148
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:19,548
Yes, these stupid women will do
anything to lose weight.

149
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,957
This plan will definitely succeed.

150
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:28,963
I'm really...

151
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:30,829
Tired...

152
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:34,330
Everyone, you have grown
unbelievably more beautiful.

153
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,606
I'm so happy!

154
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:38,868
Yes!

155
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:43,603
If you want to become really beautiful,
come again tomorrow.

156
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,703
Okay.

157
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,534
With the energy of these women

158
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,264
who would sacrifice their lives
to lose weight...

159
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:43,673
Naru and the others are so mean.
They left without telling me.

160
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:45,504
What kind of friends are they?

161
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,140
Oh, I'm so hungry!

162
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:51,944
Oh, hey!

163
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,078
That's a very tasty looking dumpling.

164
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,259
Mommy, I'm scared!

165
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,091
I can't believe it, it was
just a dumpling.

166
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,866
God, I am hungry.

167
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:17,373
It must be nice that Sailor V
is already so thin

168
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:19,603
that she doesn't have to go on a diet.

169
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,477
Watch it!

170
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,046
What's wrong, Usagi?

171
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,480
Motoki.

172
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,149
Are you not feeling well?

173
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,411
No, I'm not...

174
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,419
Do you want to go to the hospital?

175
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,921
No, rather a restaurant...

176
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:32,688
Huh?

177
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:36,715
I haven't eaten anything since
yesterday. I'm hungry.

178
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:45,425
It's not a dream. I'm being
held here in his arms.

179
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:51,036
Usagi, Usagi, are you okay?

180
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,940
Motoki...

181
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,281
Get a hold of yourself.

182
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:01,876
I'm going to make you strong
with the power of my love.

183
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,250
Power of love?

184
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:08,951
Yes, that's right. The power of love.

185
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,224
Motoki...

186
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,458
Usagi...

187
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,235
I'm so happy to be alive.

188
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,837
Usagi... are you okay?

189
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,273
The power of love is so warm.

190
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:38,384
Uh, um...

191
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:41,290
Oh good, you woke up.

192
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,815
What do you mean you haven't
eaten since yesterday?

193
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:46,262
Well...

194
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:48,030
What, your mom wouldn't let you eat

195
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,294
because your test score was
bad or something?

196
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,968
No! I just thought I'd
go on a little diet.

197
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,671
A diet?

198
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,074
Is it that funny?

199
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:06,182
I'm sorry. But you don't
have to go on a diet.

200
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:08,582
I think you should gain some
weight instead.

201
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:15,916
I think the chubby type is cuter
than the really thin type.

202
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,023
Really?

203
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,163
Yeah.

204
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,790
Yay!

205
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,132
Yummy. Definitely dumplings.

206
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,571
Yeah, it's normal to be a bit chubby
when you're young.

207
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,309
You eat a lot.

208
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:36,938
Eating your friends, I see.
Dumpling head eating dumplings.

209
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:40,613
Leave me alone.
It's none of your business.

210
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:44,520
If you eat so much, you'll
really turn into a dumpling.

211
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,817
Shut up!

212
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:47,849
Phew, nice catch.

213
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,660
Thanks for the dumpling.

214
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,494
Hey, at least you won't get too fat
now that you ate one less.

215
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:56,832
God, what a jerk!

216
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,668
He's right, you know.

217
00:14:58,668 --> 00:14:59,835
What?

218
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,072
Eat one, gain two kilograms,
eat two, gain five kilograms.

219
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:05,041
Eat three and you're...

220
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,338
Luna!

221
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:12,342
That's okay. Motoki said
chubby girls are cuter.

222
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:16,380
Hey Usagi, aren't you misunderstanding
what he said?

223
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:17,520
How so?!

224
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,391
He said he liked chubby girls.
He didn't say that he liked fat ones.

225
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:23,659
Uh-oh.

226
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,128
Anyway, there is something
terribly wrong.

227
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,397
You're right. What should I do?

228
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:33,169
1, 2, 3, 4... I ate six dumplings!

229
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,571
There's something wrong
with Ms. Haruna.

230
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:38,199
She's gotten very thin
all of a sudden.

231
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,910
Four dumplings. Five, six...

232
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,645
Oh, no! I'm gonna be fat.

233
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:43,846
It's not only Ms. Haruna,
Oh, no! I'm gonna be fat.

234
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:44,447
It's not only Ms. Haruna,

235
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,650
other girls that are going
to Gym Shapely

236
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,244
are all becoming skin and bones...

237
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,221
Are you listening?

238
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,956
That's it! Shapely.

239
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,321
Usagi!

240
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:59,559
Shapely is the only thing that is going
to save me from gaining weight.

241
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:04,390
Hey, Usagi. It might be a base
for the bad guys.

242
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, great!

243
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:10,473
Thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin,

244
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:14,000
thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin.

245
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:17,344
Oh, great, I can't keep watching this.

246
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,375
Oh?

247
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:23,452
That's... Ms. Haruna!

248
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,582
She's really skinny.
Where is she going?

249
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,895
Why are there stairs here?

250
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,030
What is that?

251
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:49,403
This young woman's energy is
almost completely gone.

252
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:54,145
We'll get the last of it today.
After that, she'll grow weak and die.

253
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,614
Oh, no!

254
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:01,785
Usagi!

255
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,850
What are you doing?

256
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:09,360
Okay, that's it!

257
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,025
Luna, where did you go?

258
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:16,772
Usagi, Ms. Haruna is going to die!

259
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:20,435
Before Ms. Haruna,
you're going to die!

260
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:25,748
Luna!

261
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:28,784
Be quiet! Calm down and listen to me.

262
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:31,344
If you move, your face will...

263
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:36,125
If we don't hurry, Ms. Haruna's
really going to die.

264
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,593
Usagi, become Sailor Moon.

265
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,086
But that's too sudden.

266
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,588
Are you going to listen to me?

267
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:47,935
I got it.

268
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:50,532
Actually, I don't get it at all.

269
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,569
Moon Prism Power Make Up.

270
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,019
Only a little more until we
reach our target level.

271
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:41,223
Take Ms. Haruna out of there.

272
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:42,758
What?

273
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:48,128
I won't forgive the evil souls that
sabotage a girl's dream to lose weight.

274
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,956
It's you.

275
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:56,769
As you know, the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

276
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,706
Sailor Moon.

277
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:09,148
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you.

278
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,714
What impudence. Get her!

279
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,389
Oh, no! I'm surrounded!

280
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:29,831
Crush her!

281
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:34,240
Luna, do something!

282
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,981
Sailor Moon! These guys are being
controlled by the rings on their head.

283
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,676
Destroy the rings!

284
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,214
No, I'm scared!

285
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,856
You can do it. You might lose
some weight if you fight.

286
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,585
Huh? What did you say?

287
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:51,588
If you fight, you will lose weight!

288
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,762
Lose weight!

289
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:01,329
Lose two kilograms in one sweat.

290
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,196
Lose five kilograms in two sweats.

291
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,409
Sweat three times and I am beautiful!

292
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:13,410
A girl who wants to lose weight
is stronger than anyone.

293
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,146
Chance!

294
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:35,864
Moon Tiara Action!

295
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:45,746
Go back to being good boys.

296
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,545
Hey, what are we doing here?

297
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,282
Phew! Maybe I lost about
one kilogram.

298
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:10,396
Jadeite, I am impressed that you have
gathered this much energy.

299
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:14,433
We will consider this
to be half-successful.

300
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,342
Thank you, Queen Beryl.

301
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:21,475
Sailor Moon will one day be
destroyed by my hands.

302
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,118
Feels good.

303
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,559
Usagi, I'm leaving a towel for you.

304
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,424
Thank you!

305
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:35,494
Is Ms. Haruna feeling better?

306
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:39,189
Yeah. She was out for a week,
but she is back at school now.

307
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,227
Well, that's good.

308
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:45,269
Mom, don't go on any weird diets.

309
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:48,736
True. Usagi should watch out too.

310
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:51,069
Oh, she's fine.

311
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:54,617
See?!

312
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,643
I'm fat. I'm fat again!

313
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,752
I exercised so much!

314
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,021
Why?!

315
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:13,570
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne
