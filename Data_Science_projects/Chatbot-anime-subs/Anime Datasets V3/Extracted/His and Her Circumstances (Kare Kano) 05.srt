1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,455
That feeling conveyed through holding hands:

2
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,688
If only we could be together for ever and ever.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,800
But, in reality...

4
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:24,300
Excuse me, is Arima from class 1-A here?

5
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,907
Oh, Miyazawa. Hang on a sec.

6
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,337
I'm sorry, he was just here a moment ago,

7
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:30,869
but I hear he went over to Construction.

8
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:33,908
Just a sec.

9
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,147
I hear he got called away by
Transportation and Management.

10
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,845
You just missed him.

11
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,621
Hang on. I hear he went to
practice for the hundred meter race.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,886
You just missed him.

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,192
Okay, I'll check.

14
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:48,662
Nope, he's not here. Maybe at the relay?

15
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,493
I have no idea where Arima is.

17
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,369
Oh, shoot!  I have to go to Records!

18
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,497
Oh, Miyazawa?

19
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:03,770
Arima was just here looking for you.

20
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,002
Miyazawa?

21
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:10,942
Practice for the Athletics Festival had begun.

22
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:15,484
And because of it...

23
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:17,551
...everyone on the staff was
totally swamped with work.

24
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:19,818
Even though we had just started
"going out" the other day...

25
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:22,024
...we spent all our time running
around between our multiple jobs.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,630
Because we don't have
regular classes this week...

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,329
...we haven't seen each
other for two whole days.

30
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:30,864
We've only just started going out and

31
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:32,996
we'll soon be busy with the Athletics Festival.

32
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,841
I hope we can at
least eat lunch together.

34
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:38,379
R...really? Is it okay to eat lunch together?

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,212
O...of course!

36
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:41,645
I want to eat with you!

37
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:53,922
Oh, Arima's so cool!

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,400
We were supposed to be enjoying a
fabulous lunch together right now...

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,831
...and then continue on to
develop a refreshing love story

41
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,929
like in a cola commercial.

42
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:08,003
But then, this had to happen.

44
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:12,645
Both love and appetite are out the window...

50
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,787
I wish I could see Arima.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,250
No, love means making time
for him even when I'm busy.

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,462
All right then! I'll do my best for him!

54
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:37,632
No! Those rows should be 4 by 10!
6 by 3 is for the VIP section!

56
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:43,138
Wrong! Totally wrong!

57
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:45,407
Sold out?!

58
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,346
Can we send the programs to the printers yet?

59
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,813
Arima? I just saw him a second ago...

60
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,743
Rats, he just left.

61
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,490
Nope, he hasn't been here.

67
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:20,446
Nope, he hasn't come over here.

68
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,212
I think I heard his voice a while ago.

69
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,344
He blew through here really fast.
Oh no! The curtain!

70
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,519
Senpai! Another misprint!

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,820
Pretend you didn't see it!

72
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,192
It's no use!
Not even Jolt is working any more!

73
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,391
I wanna go home...

74
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,303
What the hell is up with this busy-ness?

75
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:51,769
It's beyond any thought of eating lunch
with Arima at this point.

77
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:55,211
If this keeps up, I'll die.

78
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:00,547
Senpai, I handed in the list...

79
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,290
He's gone. Wonder where he went ?

80
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:09,855
Oh, well.

81
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,975
I wonder if Arima's feeling like this, too.

82
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,378
Good morning, Miyazawa.

83
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,582
You're really amazing.

84
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,500
You're letting your face slip.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,314
I wanted you to know that I like you.

86
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:17,931
I fell asleep.

87
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,264
I had a memory dream.

88
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,862
That's right, until a short time
ago that's how things were.

89
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,435
I was still Miss Goody-Two-Shoes,
and I hated Arima.

91
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,119
Arima was always with me.

92
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,181
Yes, always with me.

93
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:51,894
I want to see him.
I want to be with him.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,263
I didn't think about it at all then.

95
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:57,567
That I'd love Arima this much...

96
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:03,444
Days till the Athletics Festival

100
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,724
There you are!

101
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:25,456
Miyazawa!

102
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,525
Arima! Arima!

103
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,397
Oh, there you are!

104
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,169
Arima, we need you for a minute!

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,673
Don't bug me about every
fucking thing, GOD DAMMIT!

107
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:47,520
Sorry. Could I have just a small break?

109
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:51,487
Sure. Go right ahead.  No pressure.

110
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,359
I'm all burnt out.

111
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,834
Arima's having a pretty tough time, too.

112
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,897
This mess will be over by tomorrow.

113
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:09,250
Y...yeah !

114
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,750
Um, you...you been doing okay?

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,882
What?  Oh, just great! And you?

117
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:24,289
Except for that little outburst back there...

118
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,283
Oh, I'm fine, too.

119
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:27,823
Oh.  OK.

120
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,361
Uhm . . . yeah.

121
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,796
*Why're we being so self conscious?*
-
*I feel awkward when I haven't seen you in a while !*

122
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:42,041
Sorry !

123
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:44,837
I'm supposed to say something
smooth at a time like this...

124
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,875
It's ok! I can't think of anything either!

125
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:53,415
A...actually...! Not being able to see
you wasn't fun at all.

127
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,452
Yeah, it wasn't any fun for me, either.

129
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,001
The Athletics Festival sucks.

130
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,199
I don't want to have anything to do with the
School Festival or the field trip anymore.

00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,111
We haven't been able to do
anything that couples do at all.

133
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:22,006
Nice weather.

134
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,312
What?

135
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,560
I have to get back. See ya.

136
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:50,507
More than anything else...
that freaked me out.

138
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,681
I hope we can always be together.

140
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,519
Alrighty then!
Let's do it!

141
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,020
The actual Athletics Festival was really great.

142
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,825
Arima looked really cool when he got serious.

144
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,026
And we finally got to eat lunch together.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,506
Around this time of year the groups that people hang out
with get generally settled by class and club activities.

148
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,811
This is also the time when
the "instant couples..."

149
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,480
...that always form at the end of the
Athletics Festival are mass produced.

150
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:36,320
New couples began popping
up all over the place.

152
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:39,354
But this is a pair of guys...

153
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,692
Both of them are good-looking,
so they stand out.

154
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,826
Hey hey, what's that guy's name?

155
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,734
Oh, Asaba?

156
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,300
What?! Miyazawa, don't
you know who Asaba is?

158
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,642
He's Asaba Hideaki from class 1-F.

159
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:59,204
He and Arima are 10th
grade's two greatest heart throbs!

160
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,447
He's really popular, too!

161
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,573
He carried the trash cans for me.

162
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,281
He fetched a ball for me.

163
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,710
He really likes girls, doesn't he?

164
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,586
He's so cute !

165
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,322
Firefighters are really cool.

167
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,300
If he and Arima are friends,

168
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,598
I guess I should make friends with him, too.

169
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:25,963
I'm going out with Arima, after all...

170
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,105
Oh, hi...

171
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,673
Oh, you're Arima's girlfriend.

172
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,709
The guys all say you're cute...

173
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:42,078
...but it looks like you're not
such hot stuff in person.

175
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,124
Hey, Miyazawa. Whatcha up to?

176
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:57,168
Arima...

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hm?

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Am I c...

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,766
You're very cute!

180
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:03,168
Damn you!  Asaba!

181
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,372
Even though I've
withdrawn from active duty...

182
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,303
...how dare you badmouth me,
the "Living Embodiment of Vanity."

183
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,313
You're dead meat !

184
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,484
Just you watch, Asaba!

185
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:13,579
You're about to feel my true wrath !

186
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:21,923
Ah...

188
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:28,191
Ah...

190
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,009
You bitch! Aren't you some kind of
petite model student or something?!

191
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,773
Humph! It's your fault for making me mad.

192
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,307
Damn bitch!

193
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:45,616
Now I'm really pissed!

194
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,818
Stuff it!
I'll give you those words right back!

196
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,354

197
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:00,658
We met in the worst way possible...

198
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:03,165
...and we became arch-enemies

199
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,202
who fought at first sight of each other.

200
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,299
I wonder what's up with Miyazawa and Asaba.

201
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,437
They're at each other's throats.

202
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:15,573
But she's usually so sweet,
and Asaba's normally really nice to girls...

203
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:19,446
I hear you're not getting along with Asaba.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,285
*Pout!* I don't want to
hear that name right now.

205
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,754
I might go into combat mode and
then there's no telling what I'd do.

206
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,792
What're you talking about ?

207
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:31,092
I swear ! Arima,
how come you're friends with him ?!

209
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:32,589
What's so good about him ?!

210
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,699
Nothing in particular.

211
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:38,564
When he talks to me, I talk back.
I don't see him as a friend or anything.

213
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:40,864
I can't figure him out.

214
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,641
Whatcha lookin' at ?

215
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:44,110
Movie listings. Wanna take a look ?

216
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,807
Sure ! The movies...

217
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,576
I haven't seen any lately.
Anything good playing ?

218
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,410
I was thinking this might be good...

219
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,711
Um...say, Miyazawa?

220
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,949
If you're not busy or anything, 

221
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,349
do you want to go see it with me this Sunday ?

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,894
Yes ! Let's go, let's go,

223
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:09,524
Yay, a first date !

224
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,163
A lot's happened since I came to this school,

225
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,596
but I've finally made it this far!

226
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,042
There went my mood.

227
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,805
Hey, aren't WE in a good mood today.

228
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,312
None of your business.

229
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:26,150
You going on a date with Arima or something?

230
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,487
What if I am ?

231
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,685
Arima's got pretty weird tastes.

234
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,619
He could have had his pick
of better chicks if he wanted to.

235
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:35,722
What're you doing ?!

236
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,963
Let go !

237
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,865
Well, I bet Arima'll get
tired of this thing soon enough.

239
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,392
I guess there's nothing to worry about.

240
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:43,360
Shut up.

241
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:45,937
I'm taking Arima for myself.

242
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:49,135
W...what're you saying ?

243
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:52,400
Oh my god...

244
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,706
I heard there's a lot of them lately, 
but you're really a...

245
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,106
I'M NOT !

247
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,147
I love women !

248
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:00,778
*My sweet,*

249
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,000
Cute little lambs...

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,757
I've always loved having them all around me.

252
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,688
I've come to hold a certain ambition.

253
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,133
I want more and more girls around me!

254
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:16,327
I'm going to create Asaba Mary-Land someday!

256
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,761
And that's where
Arima comes in.

257
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,700
He's the partner I've been seeking all these years.

259
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,774
His good looks will contribute greatly to my ambition.

261
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,300
All the little Marys will be
charmed by our brilliance...

263
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,585
...and many more Marys will come
flocking to me then ever before!

265
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:37,657
Hey, Mister High School Pervert!

266
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,759
What the hell're you trying
to get Arima mixed up in ?!

267
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:41,922
It doesn't matter !

268
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,159
I don't care as long as I'm happy!

269
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:48,064
So that's why you're dissing me,
because I'm "the girlfriend."

271
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:50,298
You finally figured it out.

272
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:52,632
Since you were a quiet little model student...

273
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:54,802
...I figured you'd run away and
cry with just a little prodding.

274
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:56,503
Seems I miscalculated.

275
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,873
But I guess I don't hafta go to all the
trouble of trying to break you two up.

276
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,446
With a girlfriend like you,
Arima'll be the one to run away.

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,975
You're really pissing me off!

279
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:07,000
What a jerk!

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,846
I never figured you to be such an ass!

281
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,220
How can you be so indifferent?

282
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:12,251
Aren't you ashamed?

283
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,551
Well, lemme ask you something then...

284
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:16,762
What about yourself?

285
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,663
I don't think you and me are all that different.

286
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,768
You played the model student and
deceived everyone else, didn't you?

288
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:27,333
If I'm a jerk, then so are you.

290
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,510
Why don't you stop and think about
whether you're all that well suited for Arima.

292
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,338
Just try to come up with
some kind of retort.

294
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,546
I'll even give up on Arima
if my argument is wrong.

295
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,179
Touche.

296
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:46,552
Miyazawa?

297
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:56,965
It's always been in the back
of my mind so I can't refute it.

299
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,238
What did you say to Miyazawa ?

300
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:11,544
I know you're trying to use me.

302
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,383
Not to be conceited,

303
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,387
but many people have tried to use me in the past.

304
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,216
But I won't permit you to hurt her.

305
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:19,784

306
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,927
You seem to be pretty soft on her.

307
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,273
Tell me, what's so good about her?

309
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:36,136
Don't you get it ?

310
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,773
She stays because she wants to.

311
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:58,926
I got here early. Gotta cheer up.

312
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:02,834
I can't stop being his girlfriend
just cause of what his friend said.

314
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:04,428
Here I am.

315
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:05,597
Which one are we seeing again ?

316
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,335
Can we still make it ?

317
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,232
No problem, no problem.

318
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,579
Sorry for making you wait !

319
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,264
He's not there. I've got the time and place right.

320
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:38,762
Tomorrow, at one o'clock...

321
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:42,767
I wonder if something happened.

322
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:45,211
That was great.

323
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,270
Thanks for the meal.

324
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:47,078
See you later.

325
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,219
I was really looking forward to this.

326
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,283
Yo. What're you doing here?

327
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:26,514
Oh, a date with Arima?

328
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,611
What? Looks like it's starting already.

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,819
You got stood up, didn't you.

330
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,323
Shut up!

331
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,161
I can't believe you're making
fun of me at a time like this!

332
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:38,421
*Hey, he's making that girl cry!*

333
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:39,856
So I've been stood up!

334
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,198
Who cares!  I chose to wait!

335
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:42,592
Just leave me alone!

336
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:54,643
Sorry, I didn't think you were actually stood up.

337
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,815
And I'm sorry about the stuff I said before.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
Is this a trap ?

340
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
No, believe me...

341
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,183
I was wrong!

342
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,015
That's some change of heart.

343
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,252
Well, things happened...

344
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,024
I guess it means I don't
fight fights I can't win.

346
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,723
Hmmm?
What about the Mary-Land Project?

347
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,198
Oh, that's history, too.

348
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,500
It came to feel kind of empty...

349
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,970
And, I just realized...

350
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,508
...setting the deal with Arima aside,

351
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,338
I don't actually hate you.

352
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:29,514
I guess I had fun being with you.

355
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:43,393
I'm sorry! Just as I was leaving,
my mom collapsed from anemia,

356
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:45,128
and my father was out...

358
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:50,192
Apologize! You're a disgrace to
all men, making a girl wait!

359
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,965
Never make a girl wait, even if it
means abandoning your parents!

360
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,906
Die! Die as your apology to her!

361
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,370
It's okay!

362
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,268
Don't worry about it anymore!

363
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,705
So she says.

364
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,542
He did that on purpose.

365
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:10,815
He put on that performance so there wouldn't be
any hard feelings left over between us.

367
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,325
Still, that was dangerous.

368
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,161
I thought he was a jerk at first...

370
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:22,533
...but after that,
he became one of us.

371
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,025
Why the heck are you here?

372
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,468
I slept over at Arima's place last night.

373
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:28,671
You're even going
over to his house ?

375
00:20:29,276  --> 00:20:34,176
Right before we went to sleep, Arima told
me all about what you did that day...

377
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,709
...and he was blushing all over the place.

378
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,513
He's so cute !

379
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:40,619
He's so innocent...

380
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:43,948
SHUT UP ! Shut up, shut up,
shut the hell up!

382
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:47,719
Anyway, I made a new friend.

384
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,302
What'll happen next !

385
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,141
Sis has made a new friend and

386
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:15,572
has finally obtained happiness.

387
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:17,381
She and Arima make up for

388
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:18,683
their failed first date !

389
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:20,781
And has the time of fate finally arrived ?!

390
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,712
Next time on KareKano:
"Your Voice That Changes Me."

391
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:25,491
It's so embarassing !
