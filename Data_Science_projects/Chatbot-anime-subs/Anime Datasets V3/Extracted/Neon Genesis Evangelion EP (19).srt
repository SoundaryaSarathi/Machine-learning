<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
Unit 01's interlocking
circuit has been cut.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,540
What about the force eject signal?

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,600
It's being blocked from the plug
side. It's not being accepted.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,580
But, Shinji, if we hadn't done that
you would have been killed.

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,020
<i>That's not the point.</i>

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,980
But it is a fact.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,890
<i>Don't push me anymore.</i>

29
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>Unit 01 has 185 seconds of</i>
<i>power left in its reserves.</i>

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,630
<i>That's enough to destroy at</i>
<i>least half of Headquarters.</i>

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,730
The way he is right now,
he'll do it too.

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,930
Shinji, listen to us!

33
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,630
If Commander Ikari hadn't
made that decision,

34
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,300
everyone could have been killed!

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,430
I said that's not the point!

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,340
My father...

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,710
My father tried to kill Toji
using my hands!

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,000
That bastard!

<i>Say something! Answer me!</i>

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,280
Increase the pressure of
the LCL to maximum.

42
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,450
We have no time to waste
on a petulant child.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,350
I've still got a direct
control circuit...

44
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,190
Damn! Damn!

45
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,950
Damn...

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,470
<i>The right breast has been</i>
<i>completely dissolved.</i>

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,460
<i>We'll begin cleansing the bodily</i>
<i>fluids from Unit 03 on schedule.</i>

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,470
Have you recovered?

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,010
I can work.
Have you recovered?

50
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,140
I can work.
<i> </i>

51
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,840
I couldn't just lie in bed during
an emergency like this.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,820
So what happened to Shinji?

53
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,650
I understand that they opened the
escape hatch with a laser cutter,

54
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,520
and removed him forcibly.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,390
This sucks.

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,160
This time...

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,720
He's really finished.

58
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,020
That idiot won't find a
way out this time.

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,230
How is Ikari?

60
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,400
He wasn't injured, so he
ought to be okay.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,530
He's probably dreaming away.

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,910
Dreaming?

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,670
Yeah. Don't tell me you
don't dream?

64
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,940
Yeah. Don't tell me you
don't dream?

65
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,850
Shinji...

66
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,820
Why is he lying here next to me?

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,420
Where am I?

68
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,760
In the same hospital where
my sister is, maybe?

69
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,380
Hey, isn't that Shinji and Ayanami?

70
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,290
Ikari, why did you do that?

71
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,410
Because I couldn't
forgive my father.

72
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,950
He betrayed me.

73
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,860
Even though I was finally
able to talk to him,

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,100
he doesn't understand me at all!!

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,260
Did you try to understand
your father's feelings?

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,140
I did.

77
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,970
Why don't you try to
understand him?

78
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,570
I said I did!

79
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,440
You're running away from
unpleasant truths.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,940
Why not?!

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,000
What's wrong with running away
from reality if it sucks?!

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,110
What are those two arguing about?

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,220
This is an exception.
You've got five minutes.

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,890
Thank you very much.

85
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,000
If it isn't the Class Rep...

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,970
Suzuhara, are you okay?

87
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,010
Well, I'm still alive.

88
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,050
I thought Shinji was here though.
Was that just a dream?

89
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,050
Ikari was let out yesterday.

90
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,320
You've slept for three days,
Suzuhara.

91
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,980
I did? For three whole days?

92
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,090
Class Rep, did you...

93
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,230
No, I came here as the
class representative!

94
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,360
It's an official duty!

95
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,900
Yeah, I know that.

96
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,390
You don't know anything.

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,270
I'm sorry that I didn't get to
eat the lunch you made.

98
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,800
Don't worry about it.

99
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,710
But I am sorry that I can't bring
you a lunch here, it's not allowed.

100
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,120
Class rep?

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,090
What?

102
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,620
Would you do me a favor?
What?

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,280
Would you do me a favor?
<i> </i>

104
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,490
Would you tell my sister that
there's nothing wrong with me?

105
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,560
Get out, Shinji Ikari. The
Commander wants to see you.

106
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,740
Disobeying orders, personal
occupation of an Eva,

107
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,610
childish intimidation...

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,700
These are all criminal offenses.

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Do you have anything to say?

110
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,490
Yes, I don't want to pilot
an Eva anymore.

111
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,290
I don't want to stay here anymore.

112
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,920
Well then, leave.

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,360
Yes, I'll go back to my
teacher's place.

114
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,550
So you're running away again?

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,430
You disappoint me. I assume
that we'll never meet again.

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,530
Yes, that's my intent.

117
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,050
<i>It's me.</i>

118
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,250
<i>Erase the Third Child.</i>

119
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,550
<i>Rei will be Unit 01's</i>
<i>designated pilot,</i>

120
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,710
<i>with the dummy plug as back up.</i>

121
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,660
<i>Are you there, Shinji?</i>

122
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,750
<i>Is it true that you're leaving?</i>

123
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,590
<i>It's true, isn't it?</i>

124
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,620
<i>But why? Why are you</i>
<i>running away again?</i>

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,760
<i>I admired you.</i>

126
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,400
<i>I envied you. You're</i>
<i>different from us.</i>

127
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,670
<i>Damn! Even Toji became</i>
<i>an Eva pilot, while I...</i>

128
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,650
<i>This line is monitored.</i>

129
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,580
<i>For security reasons we have</i>
<i>terminated this call.</i>

130
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>We appreciate your cooperation.</i>

131
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,060
I assume that Asuka is
disgusted with me.

132
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,930
Yes, she didn't even ask me
to say goodbye to you.

133
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,000
That sounds like her. That's good.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,600
It's going to be hard if you keep
hiding your anger like that.

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,130
That's your philosophy, Misato.
I can't live like you.

136
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,170
As I'm sure you know,

137
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,840
there will be a lot of restrictions
placed on your activities.

138
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

139
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,510
But...

140
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,050
What?
But...

141
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,550
What?
<i> </i>

142
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,280
Let me ask you one thing.

143
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,320
Why was Toji chosen to
be the Fourth Child?

144
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,950
All your classmates are
Fourth Level candidates.

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,100
I just found out myself that it
was yet another set-up.

146
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,660
All of them?

147
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,030
All of my classmates...

148
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,230
Suzuhara was a mistake that can't
be mended with words alone.

149
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,110
But, Shinji, to be honest,

150
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,410
I was projecting all of my dreams,
hopes and purpose onto you.

151
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,280
I know that it's been a huge
burden for you.

152
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,850
But we, everyone at NERV,

153
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,080
had no choice except to entrust
our future to you.

154
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,120
I want you to remember that.

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,020
It's a selfish cause, isn't it?

156
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,130
I admit that.

157
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,060
I'll leave your pass code to HQ
and your room as they are.

158
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,590
What's the point? Get
rid of them please.

159
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,930
I won't pilot an Eva again.

160
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,430
That's the real Shinji talking.

161
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,660
I've never heard him
so positive before.

162
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,120
<i>A special state of emergency is</i>
<i>declared for the Tokai region.</i>

163
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,560
<i>All citizens must evacuate to their</i>
<i>designated shelters immediately.</i>

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,690
<i>Repeating...</i>

165
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,180

168
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,740
Target status?

169
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,410
It's moving into our perimeter.
Target status?

170
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,480
It's moving into our perimeter.

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,380
The Komagatake Defense Line
has been breached.

172
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,020
<i>The first eighteen layers of armor</i>
<i>have been shattered.</i>

173
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,490
Eighteen layers of special armor
at once! Incredible!

174
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,000
The Eva won't make there in time
for a ground level intercept.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,930
Position Unit 02 for combat
inside the Geo-Front,

176
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,460
directly in front of Headquarters.

177
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,540
Asuka will engage the target as
soon as it breaches the Geo-Front.

178
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,940
What about Unit 00?

179
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,440
It's been placed in the AT Field
Neutralization Zone.

180
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,510
However, the left arm hasn't
been regenerated yet.

181
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,810
Then, it's not ready for combat.

182
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,470
Sortie Rei in Unit 01.

183
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,850
Prepare a dummy plug as
the backup system.

184
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,350
Yes, Sir.

185
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,720
<i>Start entry.</i>

186
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,020
<i>Charge LCL.</i>

187
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,750
<i>Commence A10 nerve connection.</i>

188
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,760
<i>It's not going to work this time.</i>

189
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,830
Pulse flow is reversing!

190
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,430
Unit 01 is refusing the
neural connection!

191
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,800
Is that possible?

192
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,440
Ikari?

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes, it's refusing me.

194
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,150
Abort activation.
Sortie Rei in Unit 00.

195
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,380
Re-activate Unit 01 with
the dummy plug.

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,850
But Unit 00 isn't ready!

197
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,620
<i>It's not a problem. I can go.</i>

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,590
Rei?

199
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,120
<i>If I die, I can be replaced.</i>
Rei?

200
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,780
<i>If I die, I can be replaced.</i>
<i> </i>

201
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,330
I decided. I swore I'd
never pilot it again.

202
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,490
Hey, you! What're you doing?
Get into the shelter, quickly.

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's no use.

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
One more hit, and the armor will
be completely destroyed.

205
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,230
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

206
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,610
Here it comes. Even without
Shinji, I can beat it easily.

207
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,050
You!

208
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,190
Next!

209
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm neutralizing its
AT Field, aren't I?

210
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,140
Why doesn't it collapse?

211
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
I can't lose again!

212
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,550
No way!

213
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,770
You damn bastard!

214
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,130
Asuka, cut all the nerve
connections now!

215
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,910
Evacuation training?
What are you, stupid?

216
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,010
That stuff's not for us pilots.

217
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,410
<i>Direct hit on the Eighth Block!</i>

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,460
<i>Abandon the Sixth Shelter! All</i>
<i>survivors, go to the Third Shelter!</i>

219
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,400
Unit 02 is severely damaged.
It can't continue combat.

220
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
How's Asuka?

221
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,900
She's safe. Alive!
How's Asuka?

222
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,870
She's safe. Alive!
<i> </i>

223
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,710
Damn...

224
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,570
The Angel has started moving.

225
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,060
What's Unit 01's status?

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,210
<i>Dummy plug upload, complete.</i>

227
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,910
<i>Probe insertion, complete.</i>

228
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,250
Start contact.

229
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,720
Roger!

230
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
What?

231
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,020
The pulses have vanished.
It's refusing the dummy plug.

232
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,390
It's no use. Eva Unit 01
will not activate.

233
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,930
The dummy, Rei...

234
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,420
Are we being refused?

235
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,800
Fuyutsuki...

236
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
I'm leaving you in charge of this.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,330
Take casualties to the Sixth Block.

238
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,730
Uninjured, go to the Third Shelter!

239
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,970
This way!

240
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,670
Hurry!
This way!

241
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,470
Hurry!
Quick!

242
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,570
Quick!

243
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,340
Hurry!
Quick!

244
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,070
Hey, you! What're you doing?
Do you want to die?!

245
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,840
Hey, you! What're you doing?
Do you want to die?!

246
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,970
Asuka...

247
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,200
Is that you, Shinji?

248
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,870
Kaji?

249
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,890
What are you doing here?

250
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,760
That's my line.

251
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,620
What are you doing here, Shinji?

252
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,090
I...

253
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,620
I decided that I'll never
pilot an Eva again.

254
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,690
And since I decided that...

255
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,300
Is that so?

256
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Well, since my other job became
public knowledge,

257
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm off the combat roster.

258
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,810
So, here I am, sprinkling.

259
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,310
At a time like this?

260
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,800
What better time?

261
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,710
Although I'd rather be between
Misato's breasts,

262
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,380
I wouldn't mind being
here when I die.

263
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,870
Die?

264
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,220
That's right.

265
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,020
It's said if an Angel makes contact
with Adam, who lies below here,

266
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,290
humanity will be eradicated.

267
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,060
The Third Impact.

268
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,400
The only thing that can stop it

269
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,420
is the one thing with power equal
to an Angel's, the Evangelion.

270
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,670
Ayanami?

271
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,160
With no rifle?!

272
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,410
Is she trying to blow herself up?

273
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,900
Rei!

274
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,940
AT Field, full power.

275
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,850
What happened to Unit 00?

276
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,900
Rei!

277
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,390
What has she done?

278
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,100
Shinji, the only thing I can do
is stand here and water.

279
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,870
But you, you have something that
you can do. That only you can do.

280
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,180
Nobody is forcing you.

281
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,550
Think for yourself, and make
the decision by yourself.

282
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,040
Think about what you
have to do now.

283
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,180
Think about no longer
having any regrets.

284
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,440
<i>Direct hit on the third foundation.</i>

285
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,340
The final armor plate has melted.

286
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,870
Damn! The Main Shaft
is completely open!

287
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,980
Isn't Unit 01 ready yet?

288
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,470
It's refusing the dummy plug.

289
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,250
It failed. No response detected.

290
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,520
Keep trying. Repeat the process
from step 108.

291
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,010
Let me pilot it!

292
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,860
I... I...

293
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,950
Let me pilot Unit 01, please!

294
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,760
Father...

295
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,900
<i>Why are you here?</i>

296
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,550
I... I...

297
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,950
I am the pilot of Evangelion
Unit 01!

298
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,540
I am Shinji Ikari!

299
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,990
The target has entered
the Main Shaft.

300
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,390
It's descending.

301
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,360
Where is it heading?

302
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,660
It's advancing directly towards
Central Dogma.

303
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,900
It's coming here?

304
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,700
All personnel evacuate. Hurry!

305
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,130
<i>All personnel evacuate! Repeat,</i>
<i>all personnel evacuate!</i>

306
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,480
Eva Unit 01?!

307
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,970
Shinji!

308
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,940
Misato!

309
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,340
Launch the fifth catapult! Hurry!

310
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,140
Out of energy?

311
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,840
Unit 01 has drained its reserves.

312
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,240
The backup power supply
isn't working.

313
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,730
Shinji!

314
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,090
Shinji!

315
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,760
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Come on, move!

316
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,590
Move now or there's
no point to this!

317
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,460
That's...

318
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,260
Move! Move! Move!

319
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,030
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!

320
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,060
Move! Move! Come on, move!

321
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,700
You've got to move! Move now!
Or everyone will be killed!

322
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm sick of it already! So...

323
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,190
COME ON, MOVE!

324
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,660
Eva has re-activated!

325
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,740
Incredible!

326
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,650
No way, this is unbelievable. Unit
01's synch ratio is over 400%!

327
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,450
Does that means she's
been awakened?

328
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,780
It's eating the Angel?

329
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,770
She's taking the S2 engine
into herself?

330
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,930
Eva Unit 01 is...

331
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,990
The bindings!

332
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,260
Bindings?

333
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,200
That's right. It's not
really armor.

334
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,140
Those are restraints that allow us
to control the Eva's power.

335
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,510
But now the Eva is removing the
web that binds it to our will.

336
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,530
We can no longer control the Eva.

337
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Unit 01's been awakened
and set free.

338
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,940
SEELE won't stay quiet for this.

339
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,140
Did you say this was part of your
scenario, Commander Ikari?

340
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,890
It's begun, hasn't it?

341
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,180
Yes, this is the beginning.

342
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,300
<i>To be continued...</i>

343
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,770
Preview

344
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,000
Mankind has been saved
by the Eva's awakening,

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,180
but its pilot has been
physically fused with the Eva.

346
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,400
Shinji's been fused with another
existence. What will he see?

347
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
What was it that
the crying Misato saw?

348
