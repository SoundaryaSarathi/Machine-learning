1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,650
Where's Asuka?

23
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,090
She's already left. It would seem
that she doesn't want to face me.

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,230
But why?

25
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,200
Shinji, sometimes a woman's heart
is too difficult to understand.

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,970
By the way...
By the way...

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,570
Go ahead.

28
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,140
Is the rumor that Unit 04
disappeared true?

29
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,910
I heard that there was some kind
of accident, and it exploded.

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,150
Yes, it's true.

31
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,880
Unit 04 is gone, along with the
Second Branch of NERV.

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,650
It happened while they were
testing the S2 engine.

33
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,320
But don't worry, we'll
be all right.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,490
All three of our Evas are
functioning properly.

35
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,890
And our pilots and staff
are in good shape too.

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,860
I heard that Unit 03 is being
brought here from America.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,090
You're performing the activation
tests at Matsushiro, aren't you?

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,030
I'll be out for four days or so,

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,870
but Kaji will be taking care of
you two, so don't worry.

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,200
But what about the test?

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,740
Ritsuko will be supervising
everything.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,270
There won't be any problems.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,710
And what about the pilot?!

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,430
Well, about the pilot...

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,990
Yes?

46
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,210
Good morning!

47
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,080
I've come to ask you for your help,
Major Katsuragi!

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,930
Please! Make me the pilot
for Evangelion Unit 03!

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Episode 18:
The Judgment of Life

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,610
So, Shinji still doesn't know yet?

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,510
I just couldn't find a chance
to tell him.

52
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,850
I'm worried.

53
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,050
I just can't figure out what
he's thinking about.

54
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,720
Pull yourself together.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,150
You're the one who wanted
to be his guardian.

56
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,760
I know you're right, but...

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,090
When will you be acquiring
the pilot?

58
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,890
Well, tomorrow. There are still
some things to be arranged.

59
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,530
Still, the new pilot might
tell Shinji himself.

60
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,170
I don't think so.

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,170
He wasn't enthused enough
to be bragging about it.

62
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,010
He was only willing to accept
under the condition that his sister

63
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,130
be transferred to our hospital
here at Headquarters.

64
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,080
How can Misato be this cruel?

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,850
I'm eager to be a pilot so she
could at least use me as a backup.

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,280
Right, Toji?

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,360
What's up? You left before me,
but you're late.

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,350
What, no fight between the
newlyweds today?

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,040
I just didn't want to see
your ugly faces!

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,900
You three damn stooges!

71
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,420
Ah, the precious moment of
lunch time! Hey, where's Toji?

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,400
He's gone.

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,440
Gone? Without his lunch? Him?

74
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,450
That's impossible!

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,820
He's been acting odd lately.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,350
Suzuhara...

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,190
Oh, Ayanami, if you're looking
for Shinji, he isn't here.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,710
You know about it, don't you?

79
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,330
And Sohryu knows about
it too, doesn't she?

80
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,010
So Shinji's the only one
who doesn't know.

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,350
It's pretty rare for you to be
concerned about someone else.

82
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,820
Really? I'm not sure I understand.

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,160
You care about Shinji.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,650
Do I?

85
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,090
Maybe that's true.

86
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,580
Yeah, you do.

87
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,430
Hikari!

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,870
Let's have lunch together!

89
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,770
Two hours late, and then,
finally, he arrives.

90
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,140
He's the first guy to ever make
me wait this long.

91
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,040
Yeah, because you never waited
for the guy when you were dating.

92
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,020
This was the so called
Second Impact.

93
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,290
At that time I was living in a
place called Nebukawa,

94
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,260
but the rising water levels caused
by the melting of Antarctica

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,160
have buried it beneath the sea.

96
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,370
Sorry, newcomer, but I
had to clobber you!

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
I had to hit you, or I wouldn't
have been satisfied.

98
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm sorry, Asuka. You always
walk home with Ikari.

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,020
Forget it. The only reason I'm with
Shinji is because of my work.

100
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,550
And right now I don't feel
like looking at him.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,330
This is about Suzuhara, isn't it?

102
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, how did you know?

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,330
It's pretty obvious.

104
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,330
The three stooges are the only
ones who can't see it.

105
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,700
Ikari seems naive.

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,740
Actually, he's just a dolt.

107
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,270
He's an idiot too.

108
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,330
He hasn't got any idea as to
how to relate to others.

109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,330
Really?

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,620
I think Suzuhara might
like Ayanami.

111
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,120
Suzuhara?! He likes
that smart ass?!

112
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Well, they seemed to be very
sociable during lunch.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,630
Don't worry. It'll never happen.

114
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,470
She's 10,000 times denser than
Shinji is about communication!

115
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,630
Really?

116
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,620
Really!

117
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,310
Can I ask you one thing?

118
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,370
What?

119
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,900
What do you see in a simple
minded stooge like that?

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,770
His compassion...

121
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,660
<i>It was a mistake to get back together with you!</i>

122
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,130
<i>How can you say that now?</i>

123
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,090
Well...
<i>I can still change my life.</i>

124
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,890
Kaji sure spends a lot of time in the tub.
<i>I can still change my life.</i>

125
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,030
Kaji sure spends a lot of time in the tub.
<i>There are lots of pitfalls in life,</i>

126
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>There are lots of pitfalls in life,</i>

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,070
<i>but you just have to dig your way out.</i>

128
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,970
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
<i>but you just have to dig your way out.</i>

129
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,330
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
<i>And I'm the pitfall?</i>

130
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,570
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
<i>I don't have to live in sorrow.</i>

131
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,370
<i>I don't have to live in sorrow.</i>

132
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,770
You mean you haven't heard yet?
<i>I don't have to live in sorrow.</i>

133
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,070
You mean you haven't heard yet?
<i>There is always hope after depression.</i>

134
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,010
Who is it?
<i>There is always hope after depression.</i>

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,840
<i>There is always hope after depression.</i>

136
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,140
<i>And I'm the pronoun for your depression?</i>

137
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,280
<i>The only reason I came back was to break up again.</i>

138
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,410
I don't know.
<i>The only reason I came back was to break up again.</i>

139
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,710
<i>The only reason I came back was to break up again.</i>

140
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:55,780
<i>This is too mean.</i>

141
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,110
That was refreshing!
<i>This is too mean.</i>

142
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>A man who sucks at kissing never works out!</i>

143
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,650
What? Are you two fighting again?
<i>A man who sucks at kissing never works out!</i>

144
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,250
What? Are you two fighting again?
<i>My kissing sucks?</i>

145
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,480
I don't believe it!
<i>My kissing sucks?</i>

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,450
I don't believe it!
<i>Not just your kissing!</i>

147
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,220
Are you two always like this when Katsuragi's gone?
<i>Not just your kissing!</i>

148
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,350
Are you two always like this when Katsuragi's gone?
<i>Not just my kissing?!</i>

149
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,420
Are you two always like this when Katsuragi's gone?
<i>I knew it!</i>

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,650
No!
<i>I knew it!</i>

151
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,720
I want to be happy because you're here tonight.
<i>I knew it!</i>

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
I want to be happy because you're here tonight.
<i>Why did I repeat the same mistake?</i>

153
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
<i>Why did I repeat the same mistake?</i>

154
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,190
But I can't, not tonight.
<i>Why did I repeat the same mistake?</i>

155
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,630
But I can't, not tonight.
<i>Yes, this mistake must be corrected!</i>

156
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,260
<i>Yes, this mistake must be corrected!</i>

157
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,670
<i>I must start a new life free of regret!</i>

158
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,070
I understand. Let's go to bed.
<i>I must start a new life free of regret!</i>

159
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,530
I understand. Let's go to bed.
<i>Before you do that,</i>

160
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,330
I understand. Let's go to bed.
<i>why don't you get dressed and make the bed?</i>

161
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,100
Sleep is the best thing for these situations.
<i>why don't you get dressed and make the bed?</i>

162
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,610
Are you asleep yet, Kaji?

163
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,600
No, not yet.

164
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,950
What's my father like?

165
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,020
Well, there's a surprise question.

166
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,520
I thought you'd ask
about Katsuragi.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,960
It seems like you're always
with my father.

168
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,000
Commander Fuyutsuki is the one
who's always with him.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,660
Have you been asking around
about your father?

170
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,640
I haven't been around him much.

171
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,130
So, you don't really know him?

172
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,500
But I've learned a lot
about him lately.

173
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,350
About his work, about
my mother, so...

174
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,840
No, you're wrong. You only believe
that you've learned.

175
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,220
The fact is that people really don't
understand themselves,

176
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,590
much less each other.

177
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,150
Understanding one hundred
percent of anything is impossible.

178
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,190
That's why we spend so much
time trying to understand

179
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,430
our own motivations and
those of others.

180
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,300
That's what makes life
so interesting.

181
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,890
Does that mean that you don't
understand Misato either?

182
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,940
The kanji we use for the word "she"
literally means "woman far away".

183
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,010
Women will always be on
the distant shore

184
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,910
of a great gulf of
misunderstanding.

185
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,680
The current dividing men and
women is deeper than the ocean.

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,050
I don't understand what being
an adult must be like.

187
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,880
<i>T-minus 300 minutes to</i>
<i>Unit 03 activation test.</i>

188
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,860
<i>Main power supply, no problems.</i>

189
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,890
<i>Second apotheosis is nominal.</i>

190
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,200
<i>Coolant systems are normal.</i>

191
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,300
<i>Repairs to left arm crimp</i>
<i>lock completed.</i>

192
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,830
<i>Roger. Team B, commence</i>
<i>operation.</i>

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>No problems detected in the</i>
<i>data link to Unit 01.</i>

194
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,940
It's ready enough for
combat duty now.

195
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,840
Well, how nice for you.

196
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,840
Now that was a half-hearted reply.

197
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,340
Are you aware that this unit

198
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,110
will be assigned to you once
it's passed its tests?

199
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,240
The exclusive control
of four Evas...

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,750
If you wanted to, you could
destroy the world.

201
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,120
Have you told Shinji yet?

202
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,890
I'll tell him when this
test is over.

203
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,830
<i>The Fourth Child has arrived.</i>

204
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,990
<i>Second squad, begin readying the</i>
<i>entry vehicle immediately.</i>

205
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,330
He's not here yet, Asuka.

206
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,330
He may not come today.

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,930
I thought we might eat
together today.

208
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,600
Do you want this?

209
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,280
Unit 03's already in
Japan, isn't it?

210
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah, it got here yesterday.

211
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,720
I knew it. Who's going to pilot it?

212
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,260
Toji maybe? He's absent today,
so maybe it's him.

213
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,750
No way!

214
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,700
<i>Entry plug repairs completed.</i>

215
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,570
<i>Initiating first connection.</i>

216
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,870
<i>Transmitting pulse.</i>

217
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,240
<i>Graph readout is normal.</i>

218
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,470
<i>All checklists up to 1350</i>
<i>have been cleared.</i>

219
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,240
<i>No problems found in initial</i>
<i>contact phase.</i>

220
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,140
Roger. Shift the operation
to phase two.

221
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,950
<i>All nerve links are normal.</i>

222
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,950
<i>All checklists up to 2550</i>
<i>have been cleared.</i>

223
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,380
<i>Harmonics are normal.</i>

224
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,540
<i>We are now exceeding the</i>
<i>absolute border.</i>

225
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,250
Abort the test! Break the circuit!

226
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,030
<i>No good! Mission failure! High</i>
<i>energy readings detected in body!</i>

227
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,520
Impossible!

228
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,120
An Angel?!

229
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,750
<i>An explosion has occurred</i>
<i>in Matsushiro.</i>

230
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,050
<i>Damage level unknown.</i>

231
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,920
<i>Send the rescue squad</i>
<i>and the Third Troop.</i>

232
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,460
<i>Take care of it before the</i>
<i>SSDF gets involved.</i>

233
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,290
<i>Roger.</i>

234
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,960
Movement of an unidentified
object detected at the site.

235
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,700
Movement of an unidentified
object detected at the site.

236
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,800
Wavelength pattern is orange.
It's not confirmed as an Angel.

237
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
Go to first stage alert.

238
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,370
<i>All personnel go to</i>
<i>first stage alert.</i>

239
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,310
<i>Prepare for ground combat.</i>

240
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,910
Launch all Evas!

241
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,940
<i>Disperse in the maximum</i>
<i>intercept zone.</i>

242
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,100
<i>Air transport is scheduled</i>
<i>to go in twenty.</i>

243
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,550
An accident in Matsushiro?!

244
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,350
No way! What happened
to Misato?

245
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,190
<i>Contact hasn't been restored yet.</i>

246
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,490
But, then, what will we do?

247
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,970
<i>Stop whining! There's nothing</i>
<i>else we can do now!</i>

248
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,230
But how can we fight the
Angel by ourselves?

249
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,370
<i>Commander Ikari will take</i>
<i>command now.</i>

250
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,940
My father will...

251
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,680
The target's image has been
captured at Mt. Nobe.

252
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,170
Transferring to main monitor.

253
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,790
As I thought...

254
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,990
Transmit the abort signal.

255
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,850
Force eject the entry plug.

256
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,100
Not working. Neither abort signal
nor plug ejection code accepted.

257
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,260
What about the pilot?

258
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,430
He's still breathing and his heart's
beating, but probably...

259
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,740
Abandon Evangelion
Unit 03 at this time.

260
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,940
List it as the Thirteenth Angel.

261
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,180
But!

262
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,880
Disperse the battle line at
Mt. Nobe as planned.

263
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,370
Destroy the target.

264
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,070
<i>Target is approaching.</i>

265
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,990
<i>All units prepare for</i>
<i>ground combat.</i>

266
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,290
No way!

267
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,660
An angel? Is this an Angel?!

268
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,780
Correct, this is the target.

269
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,900
You said that this is the target,

270
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,390
but this is an Eva, isn't it?!

271
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,670
But that's...

272
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,900
How could it have been possessed
by an Angel?

273
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,440
Is it piloted by a human too,
a child like us?

274
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,210
<i>You still don't know?!</i>
<i>The pilot of Unit 03 is...</i>

275
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,070
Asuka?

276
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,440
Asuka?!

277
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,890
Eva Unit 02 has gone silent!

278
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,230
The pilot has ejected. Recovery
squad is heading for retrieval.

279
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,990
Target is moving towards Unit 00!

280
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,270
Rei, avoid close range combat
and stop the target.

281
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,670
<i>I'm sending Unit 01 in now.</i>

282
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,160
Roger.

283
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,080
He's the pilot.

284
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,310
The Angel is invading
Unit 00's left arm.

285
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,940
The nerve systems are
being corrupted.

286
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,510
Cut off the left arm. Immediately!

287
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,010
But you've got to sever the
neural connection first!

288
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,780
Cut it off.

289
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,270
Yes, Sir.

290
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
<i>Unit 00 is severely damaged.</i>
<i>The pilot is wounded.</i>

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,870
No way...

292
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,210
<i>The target is approaching you.</i>

293
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,540
<i>It will contact you in T-minus 20.</i>
<i>You must destroy it.</i>

294
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,870
But this target is...

295
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,750
Operated by a person, isn't it?

296
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,320
Another child my own age.

297
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,680
An entry plug!

298
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,950
There is a person in there,
just as I thought.

299
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,560
Life support is breaking down.

300
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,740
The pilot's life is in danger.

301
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,740
No! Cut the synch ratio to 60%!

302
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,610
Wait!

303
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,310
But Ikari, the pilot could be killed.
Wait!

304
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,580
But Ikari, the pilot could be killed.
<i> </i>

305
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,980
Shinji, why don't you fight?

306
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,280
There's a person in there, Father!

307
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,390
Irrelevant! It is an Angel!
Our enemy!

308
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,960
But... but I can't!

309
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,120
I must help him! I can't kill!

310
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,490
If you don't, you will die.

311
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,090
I'd rather die!

312
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,330
Cut all synchronization between
the pilot and Unit 01. Do it now.

313
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,470
Cut it?

314
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,710
Correct. Switch the control circuit
to the dummy plug.

315
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,910
But the dummy plug still isn't
functioning properly.

316
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,980
Without Dr. Akagi's approval...

317
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,410
It's still better than the pilot.
Do it!

318
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,900
Yes, Sir.

319
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,050
What is this?

320
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,700
What in the hell are you
doing, Father?!

321
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,770
Signal acknowledgment,
confirmed.

322
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,070
<i>Control system switching</i>
<i>is complete.</i>

323
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,940
<i>All nerves linked to the</i>

324
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,240
<i>32.8% of Emotional Elements are</i>
<i>unclear. It can't be monitored.</i>

325
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,510
Irrelevant. Open the system.
Begin the attack.

326
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,740
Is this the power of
the dummy plug?

327
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,270
<i>System status nominal.</i>

328
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,760
<i>Gain still increasing.</i>

329
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,180
<i>Stop this!</i>

330
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,890
<i>Father, no! Stop doing this now!</i>

331
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,030
Damn! Stop!

332
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,470
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

333
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,100
Stop!

334
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,010
<i>Stop!</i>

335
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,390
Eva Unit 03, no, I mean,
