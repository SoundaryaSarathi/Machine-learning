4
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,450
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,320
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,150
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7

Howza!

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,290
Yo.

25
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,560
Hi...

26
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,700
Where's Kohsaka?

27
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,740
He went home.

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,250
Oh, okay.

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,920
Ah, no wonder I can't relax.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,190
This is the first time it's just been
me and Kasukabe alone in the club room.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,770
Why am I dwelling on that
now that a year's gone by?

32
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,980
I should just talk about something.

33
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,940
I was wondering,
did you see yesterday's...

34
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,470
That "Kujiun" thing?

35
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,910
I saw it, or rather it was shown to me.

36
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,950
So what'd you think?

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,620
What'd I think?

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,680
I couldn't really tell what's going on.

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,990
No, no, no, it was well on par, a
masterpiece, on a godlike level even.

40
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,520
I mean, it's Wakada storyboards
and Higashino dramatization.

41
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,960
There's no chance it won't be good.

42
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,660
Oh yeah?

43
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,200
Let me explain!

44
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,830
The anime director's most impressive...

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,630
...and interesting combination
of staff is Wakada and Higashino.

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,300
The extraordinarily intense devotion
to tempo and layout of Wakada...

47
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,570
...and the way Higashino flawlessly
unites his designs into motion.

48
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,880
I guess the regrettable thing is
that they don't work on many episodes...

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,750
...because their animators are a
select team of only people they know.

50
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,580
Select team?

51
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,550
Maybe they don't
really trust the studio?

52
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,850
The director kind of takes
a hands-off approach, too.

53
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,650
Really.

54
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,690
After all, Wakada storyboards are in
high demand for original pictures...

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,630
...so if the work were done by unskilled
hands it'd be full of problems to fix.

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,570
In that case it's faster for acquaintances
to do it, and probably less stress.

57
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,830
Now I get it.

58
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, it's no exaggeration to say that...

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,870
...a characteristic of Wakada's
work is how light is drawn.

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh yeah, the sunlight through
the trees scene was pretty.

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,570
Aha, you noticed?

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,810
That's it, all right!

63
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,880
For real?
Cool!

64
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,650
Right, as if!

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
Sorry, it's nothing.

66
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,860
What am I getting all delusional about?

67
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,330
And what the hell, do I
actually want that to happen?

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,850
Great, now I'm just being a weirdo...

69
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,320
Talk about something, something.

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,050
That's the "Love Letter
from Beyond" series.

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,610
Yeah, it's a masterpiece.

72
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>But, I wonder if I should
share how moving this is.</i>

73
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>That'd be nice.
Leave it be.</i>

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm so inflexible.

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,380
I know full well that reality can't just
be divided up into choices like that.

76
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,340
Well, I'll keep it simple.

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,350
Good manga, eh?

78
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,320
She's ignoring me!

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,530
No, no, even Kasukabe
wouldn't do that I don't think.

80
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,430
Ah, volume 9!

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,460
That's an especially good part, where
Toki and Shiira are finally reunited.

82
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,740
She's engrossed.

83
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,770
Well, that makes me happy in a way.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,710
<i>Madarame: Good manga, eh?</i>

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,150
<i>"Whisper of the Flying God" is good too.
Keep quiet.</i>

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,970
No! If I don't start doing
something I'll look suspicious.

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,450
Eeeek!

88
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,810
No, no, no!
That must never happen!

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm no one-man comedy troupe!

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,660
No way can I take this out in here!

91
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,990
M-Mind if I turn on the TV?

92
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,830
Nah.

93
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,460
Thank you...

94
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,540
Wait, why am I thanking her?

95
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,900
Oh, excuse me.

96
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,020
Do aliens use the bathroom a lot?

97
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,880
When visiting the planet Eldo, women
especially should beware of constipation.

98
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,260
Say what?

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,220
<i>I've got it!
Say what?</i>

100
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,560
I found the aliens' weakness!

101
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,150
There are actually three female aliens!

102
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,060
But there's always two of them...

103
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,890
They look the same so we didn't
notice, but they constantly swap places.

104
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,530
You know, even Kujiun
has its share of issues.

105
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,930
Even when it's for a gag, I don't like
it when they resort to dirty jokes.

106
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,770
The fans eat it up, though.

107
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,680
Maybe the problem is that until now
they've for the most part stayed true...

108
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,120
...to the original story, but starting with
these episodes they stray really far off.

109
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,620
Get set.

110
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm sorry, I slipped up.

111
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,740
On your marks.

112
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,960
Get set.

113
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,110
I'm sorry, that time I jumped the gun...

114
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,940
Well...

115
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,280
How should I put it?

116
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,050
I'm getting swept away!

117
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,900
Get set.

118
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,740
S-Should I turn it off?

119
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,110
It'd be best if I did, it's so noisy.

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
Ah, um...

121
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,810
Uh...

122
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,840
That's weird...

123
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,080
Oh geez.

124
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,650
That's funny, where'd it go?

125
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,590
Uh...
Hmmm...

126
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,260
Ah man, ummm.

127
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,330
Uh no, it's nothing. I'm all right,
that is, I wasn't trying to sneak a peek.

128
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,600
Really, I wasn't.

129
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,080
Oh, right!
So that's it...

130
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,910
Talk about close calls.

131
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,010
Why did I leave?

132
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,890
Why am I running away
after that little stunt?

133
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,890
Although, going back right
away would be unnatural.

134
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,260
This is weird.

135
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,890
Kasukabe being around shouldn't
really bother me this much.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
She's far off from my usual range.

137
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,400
She should be the one being careful
and uncomfortable in this situation.

138
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,440
What a joke.

139
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,210
I just I just need to
talk to her more naturally.

140
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,720
Naturally.

141
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,180
Thirsty?

142
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,920
Huh?

143
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,760
No, I'm good.

144
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,660
Here, it's in a can so
nothing weird got put in it.

145
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,820
No, that's not the issue.

146
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,760
There's no need, I don't want it.

147
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,730
Oh, yeah, all right.

148
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,830
Uh...

149
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,230
What?

150
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,860
That's weird, am I way off?

151
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,390
She must think this
is awkward too, right?

152
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,690
Maybe she feels sorry for being rude,
or that it'd be bad to just leave now.

153
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,490
That's it...

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
That must be it...

155
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,130
How are things?

156
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,970
Did something happen?

157
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,140
Like what?

158
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,140
Like with Kohsaka.

159
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,480
Like with Kohsaka.

160
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,050
Not especially.

161
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,910
Nothing's amiss?

162
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,160
The usual.

163
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,490
Oh, that sounded kind of iffy.

164
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,160
What gives!

165
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,060
Uh, well, it's rare to
see you act this way...

166
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,860
...staying behind in the club
room after Kohsaka's gone home...

167
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,440
It's like "wow," what a surprise.

168
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,790
What is this, a TV interview?

169
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,200
No, not at all!

170
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,530
It's just a bit mysterious!

171
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,470
I'm not trying to pry at all...

172
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,810
...I just purely though whoa,
I never thought I'd see the day!

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,340
Actually, I hate it when people stick their
noses into other peoples' business...

174
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,850
Um, sorry.

175
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,340
Right.

176
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,820
Do we have the next one?

177
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,530
Oh, volume 10?

178
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,770
We sure do!

179
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,500
Umm, it should be around...

180
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,800
Here it is.

181
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,810
You know, "Whisper of the Flying
God" by the same artist is good too.

182
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,210
I'll lend it to you
if you want to read it.

183
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,140
No thanks.

184
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,810
I'm still in the middle of this one.

185
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,540
Quite right, that you are!

186
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,520
Here's volume 10.

187
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,320
Thank you.

188
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,990
Am I that unpleasant?

189
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,530
Am I the Andromeda Strain?

190
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,400
What? Hold on a second.

191
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,340
No girl should have something
like that hanging out of her nose.

192
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,240
This is just too much, too manly even...

193
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,900
No wait, calm down! It might
just be some trash or something.

194
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,880
Or maybe my imagination's
just getting away from me!

195
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,610
I need to not look like I'm staring,
and take another glance to make sure.

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,060
In a way, this is an awesome
chance to strike up a conversation.

197
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,430
On second thought, wait.

198
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,470
Wait just a minute...

199
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,130
The way it's hanging, it might
not be attached any longer.

200
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,640
How could a nose hair grow that long?

201
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,010
It'll fall off on its own.

202
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,440
Yeah, it'll fall off.

203
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,140
Or will it?

204
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,620
Even if it will, should she
go out of here like that?

205
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,190
I'd feel bad for her if
anyone else saw her like that.

206
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,220
It'll take another 30 minutes
to finish reading that.

207
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,460
No, Kasukabe's no manga reader
so it'll probably take 45 minutes.

208
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,330
If she's about to leave and it still
hasn't fallen off, I guess I'll mention it.

209
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,110
No, if someone else from Genshiken
shows up before that, forget it.

210
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,410
I can't tell her in
front of someone else...

211
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,540
Hm? What's the matter?

212
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,190
There's something under your nose.

213
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,580
Huh? Where?

214
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,990
Here.

215
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,920
Eek!
This is a nose hair!

216
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,680
You saw it!
I'm so embarrassed!

217
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

218
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,620
Yeah, I can do this.

219
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,700
Just keep the mood light.

220
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,090
Here goes.

221
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,000
<i>Leave it be.</i>

222
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,150
In a game when there's only one
choice, it's a real relief...

223
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,210
But then, when it comes to real life...

224
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,260
No, they don't exist!

225
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,420
Heroines don't have
protruding nose hairs!

226
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,500
It's for her sake, but more importantly
I can't let this continue!

227
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,600
If I give in to this, I lose
out to something spiritually.

228
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,040
What spirit I don't know...

229
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,540
But it's okay!

230
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,340
This kind of thing shouldn't
hurt Kasukabe that much!

231
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,570
...I don't think.

232
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,380
Nonchalantly! Naturally!
With a smile on my face...

233
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,590
Don't feel bad...

234
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,530
What's with them?

235
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,430
Talk about serious.

236
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,250
Hey, Madarame.

237
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,490
What do you figure
they're talking about?

238
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,220
Heh, stupid stuff.

239
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,320
Did she start her period or something?

240
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,510
Now he's in trouble!

241
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,490
W-Was I right?

242
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,370
I am so...

243
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,770
What's worse, I was the only one
who didn't get any chocolate that year.

244
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,710
All 18 of those girls hated my guts...

245
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,170
No, being slapped in
public makes one a man.

246
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,780
That was a medal for me.

247
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,650
That'll do for now, anyway.

248
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,120
That's not the problem, though! I need to
draw her attention to this somehow!

249
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,920
I've always been told I didn't
have an attention span...

250
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,590
...now I see what they meant!

251
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,330
Hey.

252
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,210
Just kidding.

253
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,210
There's something under your nose.

254
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,340
Huh?

255
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,210
Hold still.

256
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,280
There, it's gone.

257
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,220
Thank you.

258
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,590
C'mon, less thinking more doing!

259
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,330
Yes! My extraordinary
"delightful face!"

260
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,270
Sorry!

261
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,610
Nah, I'm okay.

262
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,550
I didn't only slap you
just now, I let you have it.

263
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,260
Oh, you did?

264
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,950
I honestly couldn't tell.

265
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,760
Huh? You couldn't?

266
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,660
No, well, seriously.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,560
I'm totally okay.

268
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,270
Oh, the trash fell off.

269
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,270
Huh?

270
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,770
It was, um, stuck under your nose.

271
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,600
Eh...

272
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
Uh, wait, where are you going?

273
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,750
Just to go look in a mirror.

274
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,340
Mirror?
Hey, hold on...

275
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,610
No I'm fine, I really mean it.

276
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,280
Sorry, I'm sorry.

277
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,300
It's all cut up.

278
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,320
It couldn't be.

279
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,310
He hasn't come back.

280
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,650
What was that all about?

281
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,010
Dwelling on her...

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,880
Even though it's been a whole year...

283
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:51,000
Or in a way, maybe it's because
it's been a whole year...

284
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:40,910
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

285
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:50,380
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

286
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:59,660
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

287
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:09,400
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

288
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:19,820
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

289
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:31,130
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

290
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:40,740
<i>The time we spied from there sparkled,
even if nothing big happened.</i>

291
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:50,710
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

292
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:59,590
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

293
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,890
Where is the Holy Land
for people like us?

294
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,000
I guess it would have to be Big Sight?

295
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,200
Wrong.

296
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,210
Then Kamiigusa in Suginami Ward,
or maybe Hitotsubashi or Otowa.

297
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,140
Wrong.

298
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,230
Then, where?

299
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,270
The Takizawa Lounge!

300
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,210
Where they charge 1000 yen
for a cup of coffee?

301
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,550
Yeah, where they say all
the employees are widows!

302
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,520
They also say it's the most
expensive in the business!

303
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,780
Even if you see someone you
know, you don't greet them.

304
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,220
Those are the rules and manners!

305
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,990
Holy Land finalized!
