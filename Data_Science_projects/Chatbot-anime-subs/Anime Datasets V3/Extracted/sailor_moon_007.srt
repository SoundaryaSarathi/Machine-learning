1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,603
You're the bad person who tricks girls
who dream of becoming Cinderella

2
00:00:06,603 --> 00:00:09,868
with a pair of fake glass shoes!

3
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:19,804
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon
will punish you!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

5
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

6
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

7
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

8
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

9
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

10
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,115
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

11
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,197
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

14
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,300
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

15
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:07,412
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

16
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,550
and gave me a peculiar transforming
brooch and made me a sailor warrior.

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,619
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

18
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:17,019
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:20,314
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:32,493
Usagi Learns a Lesson!
The Road to Stardom is Tough

21
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,977
If I'm like this even before
I get to school,

22
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,946
I'll be so tired that I won't
be able to study.

23
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:49,788
Mikan's Recommendation
For Anyone Tired
Genkirin
Kekkou Medicines

24
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:50,789
Mikan's Recommendation
For Anyone Tired

25
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,494
Mikan's Recommendation
For Anyone Tired
"Mikan's Recommendation
For Anyone Tired."

26
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:55,789
Mikan's Recommendation
For Anyone Tired

27
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,164
Maybe I'll buy one, since Mikan
is recommending it.

28
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,859
I'm late! I'm late!

29
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,195
Ouch!

30
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,830
What are you doing?!

31
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,542
Oh, that hurt!

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,073
You made it on time because
I smacked you. Be thankful!

33
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:24,623
Ta-da! I finally got a poster of Mikan!

34
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:28,252
Umino, did you steal this poster
from the drugstore?

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,031
No, I got this through a
certain internet store!

36
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:33,965
If you want one,

37
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,401
I have several left over, so I'll sell it
to you at a cheap price.

38
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,805
No, thanks, I don't want one.

39
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:44,543
As you know, Mikan Shiratori is from
our Juban Municipal Junior High.

40
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:45,243
She's 17 years old and already
in eight commercials.

41
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:48,747
Mikan Shiratori... 17 years old
CM Works Done... 8 commercials
She's 17 years old and already
in eight commercials.

42
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:48,847
Mikan Shiratori... 17 years old
CM Works Done... 8 commercials
Her monthly income is 2,000,000 yen.

43
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:50,849
Mikan Shiratori... 17 years old
CM Works Done... 8 commercials
Monthly Salary... 2,000,000 yen
Her monthly income is 2,000,000 yen.

44
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:51,116
Her monthly income is 2,000,000 yen.

45
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:53,676
Wow! 2,000,000 yen?!

46
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:57,789
I wonder how many shortcakes I could
buy with that kind of money?

47
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:01,026
Wasn't she scouted when
she was walking in town?

48
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,727
She was lucky!

49
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:06,431
Yeah. If I were lucky like her,
I could do the same thing!

50
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,933
Piece of cake!

51
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,835
I can't believe those scouts
never spotted us.

52
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,503
They just don't know a good thing
when they see it.

53
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,272
To put it bluntly, the scouts do
know when they see a good thing,

54
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,841
and that's why you girls
were ignored.

55
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,409
What did you say?!

56
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:18,844
Frankly speaking, at our Juban
Municipal Junior High,

57
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:22,507
the next star to follow in Mikan
Shiratori's footsteps is...

58
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:27,708
Miss Usagi.

59
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:33,725
I'm a star!

60
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:34,493
Yeah!

61
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:34,726
New Spring Show on Channel 9
Rock, Paper, Scissors with Mikan!
Yeah!

62
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:35,594
New Spring Show on Channel 9
Rock, Paper, Scissors with Mikan!

63
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:35,861

Oh, Mika! Please give me
your autograph!

64
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:36,161
Oh, Mika! Please give me
your autograph!

65
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,363
TV Ashita
Oh, Mika! Please give me
your autograph!

66
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,489
Oh, Mika! Please give me
your autograph!

67
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,300
Here! Please watch my show.

68
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,461
I can use this energy.

69
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,347
What?! Sing together?

70
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,316
That's right! We'll storm the
entertainment world!

71
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:59,840
Storm them?!

72
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:04,087
I'm ready now!

73
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:09,094
No, no! I meant that we'd
try to sell our songs!

74
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,495
And we'll become bigger
stars than even Mikan!

75
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:14,399
Stars?

76
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,734
Right!

77
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:18,236
Let's do it, let's do it! I'm all for it!

78
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:21,072
She should know that we
don't have time for that.

79
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,341
Together, we have nothing
to be afraid of!

80
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,143
We'll be Cinderellas overnight!

81
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:26,838
Then, let's go for it!

82
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,322
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,

83
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:40,223
I can say it in my dreams.

84
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,822
My thoughts are about
to short circuit,

85
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,798
I want to see you right now.

86
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:48,633
Hey, stop killing the cat!

87
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,168
When do you mean, killing the cat?!

88
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,534
How rude! We're going
to be future stars!

89
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,402
See ya!

90
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,708
Okay, one more time!

91
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay!

92
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:03,815
Guided by the light of the moon,

93
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:05,217
Ouch!
Guided by the light of the moon,

94
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,085
Guided by the light of the moon,

95
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,079
we will meet again and again.

96
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:14,759
Ouch! Oh, Usagi, you're so clumsy!

97
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,094
Ouch! Oh, Usagi, you're so clumsy!
I count the sparkle of constellations...

98
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:16,294
I count the sparkle of constellations...

99
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,029
You, too, Naru!

100
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,894
You're so quick to blame me!

101
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,866
So are you!

102
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:26,064
All right, then let's both go our
separate ways to become Cinderella!

103
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:30,374
No problem! But in that case, we'll be
rivals from this moment on!

104
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,984
I said all that, but I don't know
what to do.

105
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,222
Did you learn your lesson?

106
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,826
It's so funny!

107
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,227
It's the best!

108
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,661
Hey, Luna, how about trying
something like that, too?

109
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,229
Dad, thanks for the great idea!

110
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,704
Pretty soon, we'll have
entertainment reporters

111
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,069
knocking at our door!

112
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,044
Does she have a fever or something?

113
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,612
She always acts like that.

114
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:09,739
That's nothing, compared
to how she usually acts.

115
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,416
Don't Come In!

116
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,984
Don't Come In!
Now, "Have you learned your lesson?"

117
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,716
Why do I have to do
something like this?

118
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,326
Don't complain! Okay, one more time!

119
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:22,588
"Have you learned your lesson?!"

120
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:25,530
Pardon me.

121
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,160
Gurio Umino has come to see Naru
after receiving an invitation by phone!

122
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,504
Shush! Just get inside quick!

123
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,642
Well, in your case, I couldn't expect
more out of you, Umino.

124
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:41,246
Excuse me, but why do I have
to dress up like this?

125
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:43,348
I need to study.

126
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,909
Now, now, Umino, you need to
learn about real life, too!

127
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:48,943
Learn about real life?

128
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,156
Usagi once told me,

129
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:55,593
that you'd be even more attractive if
you knew a little more about real life.

130
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,296
Miss Usagi said that?!

131
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,464
Oh, my! I'll do anything!

132
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,103
The beauty and the beast combo.

133
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:07,539
This just might attract
a lot of attention.

134
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,339
I feel as though my whole life
has changed, Naru!

135
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,366
Really?

136
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:29,452
To Mikan

137
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,407
Someone! Help!

138
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:05,363
You, too, and even you could follow
in Mikan Shiratori's footsteps!

139
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:08,389
Everyone can be Cinderella,
starting today!

140
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:13,067
Hi, everyone! I'm Mikan Shiratori!

141
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:13,772
Cinderella Caravan

142
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:18,072
Cinderella Caravan
How are you doing? We're
looking for stars like me!

143
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:20,612
What? Is that the real Mikan?

144
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,341
It really is her!

145
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,281
Everyone, make sure to apply
to our Cinderella Caravan!

146
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,122
I will! I will!

147
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,791
I wanna be Cinderella!

148
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,392
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!

149
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:37,629
Cinderella Caravan
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!

150
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,824
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!

151
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,469
Hey, did you hear about the
Cinderella Caravan?

152
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,731
What's that?

153
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,940
Usagi, you're so behind!

154
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,408
I've got a lot of things
going on, okay?!

155
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:55,507
They're looking for the next Mikan
Shiratori through the Caravan!

156
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:58,450
Since even Mikan is assisting
in the search,

157
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,145
this is a pretty sure way to stardom!

158
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,256
I'll definitely win!

159
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,760
What are you talking about?!
I'm the one who's going to win!

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,387
Right, Umino?

161
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,564
You are so right, Naru!

162
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,495
You don't need to do that right now!

163
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:21,932
Practice, practice.

164
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,835
Everyone, what do you want to be?

165
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,814
A star!

166
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,383
You guys, why aren't you in school?

167
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,020
Mikan, what are you doing,
canceling your appointments?!

168
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,456
You can't just go off and
do things on your own!

169
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,226
You, too, can be a star,
starting from today!

170
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,454
A star?

171
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:44,291
A star!

172
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,059
I can walk on my hands!

173
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:51,569
V balance!

174
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,332
Those are great performances!

175
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,866
We're stars!

176
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,105
Today is the day we'll show them
what we've been working on!

177
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,949
I quit!

178
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:07,315
What?! Why now?

179
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:12,190
I figured maybe you needed a little
break, so I put up with it, but...

180
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,591
Hey, so you understand.

181
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:17,729
But this isn't just a little break, you're
serious about becoming a star.

182
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,663
No, I'm not.

183
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,766
Yes, you are!

184
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,734
Am not!

185
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:26,500
Then, don't apply for the
Cinderella Caravan!

186
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:32,010
Now's not the time to be goofing off!

187
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,240
Do you understand your situation?

188
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,114
So, you'll quit, won't you?

189
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,917
Now, let's go home! Seriously,
we don't have time for this!

190
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,822
Luna, you meanie!

191
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,997
Honestly...

192
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:57,024
Luna just doesn't understand a
young girl's genuine dream!

193
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,803
Hi!

194
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,074
I just had to bump into the guy
I didn't want to see.

195
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,581
I can see your dumpling head.

196
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,516
Don't tell me you're going to
that Cinderella Caravan.

197
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,354
Well, I guess Dumpling Head

198
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,656
would have to compete
with a comedy routine.

199
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:21,960
Are you kidding me?! Of course,
I'm not going!

200
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,224
Get out of my way! I'm going home!

201
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,327
Darn it, he's such a busybody!

202
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,203
Yesterday, I went to buy two
loaves of bread (pan)!

203
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,004
Uh-huh.

204
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,666
Then, they suddenly gave me
strawberry-patterned panties (pantsu)!

205
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,408
What the heck?

206
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,467
Two loaves of bread is
"pan-two (panties)"!

207
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,077
You pass! You're stars!

208
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,082
Miracle romance!

209
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,154
Congratulations! You pass!

210
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,719
Pass

211
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:23,664
We did it!

212
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,499
It must be our talent!

213
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,868
People who passed will be in a show,

214
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:30,234
which will be held at Shan Shan
Plaza next Sunday!

215
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:33,029
From that moment on, all
of you will be stars!

216
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,073
Stars!

217
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:45,351
What's going on?

218
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,754
Is that about how things work?

219
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,990
Yeah, it is. Then, how about this one?

220
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,060
What do you get if you take away a
vulture's (hagetaka) feathers (ge/ke)?

221
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,221
You get naked (hadaka), of course.

222
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,497
Good morning, Naru!

223
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:58,691
Here!

224
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,432
Naru Osaka

225
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,636
Here!

226
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,339
Okay, does everyone
have a roll of tape?

227
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,536
Oh, Miss Usagi! Here, please
throw this, okay?

228
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,809
Everyone, I'm going to be holding
an autograph session now!

229
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,248
Everyone, class is going to start!

230
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,451
Getting into the entertainment
business isn't easy!

231
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:18,585
We don't have time for class!

232
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:19,319
Okay! Throw the tapes!
We don't have time for class!

233
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,980
Okay! Throw the tapes!

234
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:24,281
Ouch!

235
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,357
You shouldn't damage a star's
precious face!

236
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,621
Something is wrong here.

237
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:34,701
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,

238
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,070
I can say it in my dreams.

239
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,138
Don't you think they're
acting a little weird?
I can say it in my dreams.

240
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:38,972
Don't you think they're
acting a little weird?
My thoughts are about to short circuit,

241
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,107
Yeah.
My thoughts are about to short circuit,

242
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,475
Everyone around here is
acting like them.
My thoughts are about to short circuit,

243
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:42,142
Everyone around here is
acting like them.
I want to see you right now. Go! Go!

244
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,877
They all think they've become stars
I want to see you right now. Go! Go!

245
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,445
And they've stopped studying
and working.
I want to see you right now. Go! Go!

246
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,413
And they've stopped studying
and working.
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,

247
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:48,715
I wonder if this is the doing
of another monster?
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,

248
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:48,782
I wonder if this is the doing
of another monster?
Midnight that keeps me from calling.

249
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,050
They're all people who participated
in the Cinderella Caravan.
Midnight that keeps me from calling.

250
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,052
They're all people who participated
in the Cinderella Caravan.

251
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,488
Then, I almost became
one of them, too.
Because I'm so innocent,
what should I do?

252
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:54,721
Yup, so you should thank me.
Because I'm so innocent,
what should I do?

253
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,423
Yup, so you should thank me.
The heart is a kaleidoscope.

254
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,290
The heart is a kaleidoscope.

255
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,991
But you could say that you got in
the way of my becoming a star.
The heart is a kaleidoscope.

256
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:00,255
But you could say that you got in
the way of my becoming a star.

257
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,854
I can't believe you're
still saying that.

258
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,799
Please come to Shan Shan Plaza
on Sunday.

259
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,001
That's where our concert's going to be!

260
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,470
We still have more tickets!

261
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,239
What are you saying?!

262
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,676
We're the one's who are putting
a show on at Shan Shan Plaza!!

263
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:16,510
Excuse me?

264
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,077
What did you just say?! It will be
our concert!
Excuse me?

265
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:18,912
What did you just say?! It will be
our concert!

266
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,480
No, it will be our live show!

267
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,948
No, it will be mine!

268
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:24,178
Everyone seems to think
they're the star.

269
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:31,317
You, too, can be a star.
Cinderella Caravan
Cinderella Caravan
You, too, can be a star.

270
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:35,162
It's weird. There aren't any
customers lined up.

271
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:35,295
Shan Shan Plaza
It's weird. There aren't any
customers lined up.

272
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:36,329
Shan Shan Plaza

273
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:37,864
Shan Shan Plaza
Are you ready?!

274
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:41,198
All right, everyone's show
is going to start now!

275
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,702
You can hear them, can't you?
The audience is cheering!

276
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,616
Let's do our best, Yumiko!

277
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:57,742
Okay!

278
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,021
At long last!

279
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:09,229
I'm getting excited!

280
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,330
Pass Pass
I'm getting excited!

281
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,297
Pass Pass

282
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,366
Let's do it, Yumiko!

283
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,434
Okay!

286
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,106
One hand handstand!

287
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:20,971
My new V balance!

288
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,901
I'm going to start taking
your energy now.

289
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,391
Soon, I will be able to offer fresh
energy to our great ruler.

290
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:50,670
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams.

291
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,160
Handspring!
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams.

292
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:55,408
My thoughts are about
to short circuit...

293
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:55,742
Reverse handspring!
My thoughts are about
to short circuit...

294
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:56,731
Reverse handspring!

295
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,179
What is that?

296
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,647
It's strange, isn't it?

297
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:08,355
Because I'm so innocent,
what should I do?

298
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,756
The heart is a kaleidoscope.

299
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:10,924
You saw me, didn't you?
The heart is a kaleidoscope.

300
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:11,549
You saw me, didn't you?

301
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:17,796
Mikan is...

302
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:19,858
Usagi!

303
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,195
Usagi! Usagi!

304
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,038
Now, transform into Sailor Moon!

305
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,579
Do I have to go there again?

306
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:34,672
Naru and everybody else
are in danger!

307
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,941
Okay, then.

308
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:44,285
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

309
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,433
Miracle romance!

310
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:35,307
Yeah! I'm sorry I'm not
straightforward...

311
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,686
What's going on?!

312
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:57,197
You're the bad person who tricks girls
who dream of becoming Cinderella

313
00:18:57,197 --> 00:19:00,496
with a pair of fake glass shoes!

314
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,498
Who are you?!

315
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,698
I'm the sailor warrior of
love and justice,

316
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:13,975
Sailor Moon!

317
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:17,584
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

318
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:18,710
What?!

319
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:25,283
I knew it! You're not Mikan, are you?!

320
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,729
You won't escape me!

321
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,662
Where did you go?

322
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:43,275
Luna, where are you? Oh, she's
never around when I need her!

323
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,570
I found you!

324
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:54,576
What is this?!

325
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,457
What's going on?

326
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,902
I can't move!

327
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,432
I can't breathe...

328
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,674
You will die there.

329
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,446
What?! Who?!

330
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,125
Sailor Moon, you're the star
of the show!

331
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,649
Tuxedo Mask!

332
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,795
Good luck!

333
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,763
How dare you interfere?!

334
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,821
Sailor Moon, now!

335
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,134
Stop!

336
00:20:57,183 --> 00:21:01,381
Moon Tiara Action!

337
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:27,440
Huh?

338
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:29,549
What am I doing here?

339
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:30,817
No!

340
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,185
Where are we?

341
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:35,055
Kuri, when d'you start talkin' in
the Kansai dialect?

342
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,420
I don't know.

343
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:49,836
I'm so tired.

344
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:52,305
Nothing good ever happens if
you're always goofing off.

345
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:53,636
Okay, okay.

346
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:57,807
Don't, "Okay, okay," me! Have you
learned your lesson?!

347
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:13,215
In my dream, you and I were together

348
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:20,057
Protected by the stars

349
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:35,278
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

350
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:42,518
And we casually talked to each other

351
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:51,226
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

352
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:58,231
I want to become prettier
right here and now

353
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:05,778
Something changes when
you fall in love

354
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:12,347
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

355
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:26,162
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
