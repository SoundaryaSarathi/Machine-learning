1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,530
It was summertime.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,370
And with final exams
coming close,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,500
my good mood was wandering about
somewhere in Brazil,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,560
and it didn't seem like it
was going to come back.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,980
Hey, do you know
what day it is today?

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,310
Is it your birthday?

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,250
Nope.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,750
Is it Miss Asahina's birthday?

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,910
Wrong!

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,620
It is Koizumi
or Nagato's birthday?

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,980
I don't know when
those are!

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,420
By the way, my birthday is...

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,010
That doesn't matter.

14
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,830
You don't know what an important
day it is today, do you?

15
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,190
It's just a hot weekday
to me.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,030
Tell me what day of
the month it is.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,020
July seventh...

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,870
Are you saying that you've been
talking about Tanabata?

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,840
Of course I'm talking about Tanabata!
It's Tanabata today!

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,210
You're Japanese, you've got to
remember these kinds of things!

21
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,550
I see.

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,680
I always make sure to take part
in events like these.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,620
This year, the whole SOS Brigade
is going to make this a huge affair!

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,880
And here we go.

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,530
Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,730
Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody
Since this past spring, it's
become my daily routine

27
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,000
to run aimlessly about
this way and that

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,670
when Haruhi gets going
about something.

29
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,070
I kind of hate the fact
that I'm getting used to it.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,980
Yes?

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,210
Hey.

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,220
Hello.

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,520
Hello.
How are you doing?

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,980
Things have been crazy for me
ever since I started high school.

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,720
Here you go.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,090
Thank you.

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,560
You're welcome.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,320
Would you like to
try this out?

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,030
We'll eventually get bored
of othello, after all.

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,300
Unfortunately, I don't know
the rules.

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
That's too bad.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,570
This is your only chance
to be so carefree.

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,970
She's come up with another
hair-brained scheme...

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,440
Hey ho! My bad, my bad,
sorry I'm late!

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,610
Where the heck did you pick up
that branch and that greeting?

46
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,010
The forest behind
the school.

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,350
That's someone's private property,
you bamboo thief.

48
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,350
Here, I also made tanzaku.

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,450
Write down your wishes,
everyone!

50
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,390
Tanzaku?

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,790
I see. Today is Tanabata,
after all.

52
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,690
There are conditions,
however!

53
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,300
Conditions? Hold on, we haven't even said
that we're going to write anything.

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,700
Kyon, do you know who makes wishes
come true during Tanabata?

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,470
Orihime and Hikoboshi, right?

56
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,870
Well, that's correct.
Ten points.

57
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,770
Okay, then, do you know which stars
Orihime and Hikoboshi are?

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,680
Nope.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,140
That would be Vega and Altair,
I believe.

60
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,650
Eighty-five points!

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,920
That's why you have to hang your
tanzaku facing those stars!

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,150
What about the other
fifteen points?

63
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,120
Ahem!

64
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
Let me explain.

65
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,290
According to the theory
of relativity,

66
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,330
it isn't possible to travel anywhere
faster than the speed of light.

67
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,790
Incidentally,
Vega and Altair are

68
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,030
25 and 16 light years
from Earth, respectively.

69
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
Vega - 25 light years
25 and 16 light years
from Earth, respectively.

70
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,020
Altair - 16 light years
25 and 16 light years
from Earth, respectively.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,470
Which means!

72
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,900
That any information that
leaves the Earth will take

73
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,970
at least that much time before
it reaches those stars!

74
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,310
You went to the trouble
to look that up?

75
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,510
That's why neither of
the gods will be able

76
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,640
to make your wish come true
at least until that long after.

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,550
So if you wish for a boyfriend
by this Christmas or something,

78
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,950
it won't get there
in time!

79
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,720
If it takes that long
to go one way,

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,190
won't it take 50 years or 32 years
for it to make the round trip?

81
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,420
Well, they're gods, so they'll
think of something.

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,890
It's like a half-price
summer bargain.

83
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,490
What happened to "according to
the theory of relativity"?

84
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,400
Here are two tanzaku, one each
for Vega and Altair.

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,070
So, write wishes that you want to
come true in 25 and 16 years!

86
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,370
We don't know what we'll be doing
in 25 or 16 years,

87
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,860
so what the heck should
we be wishing for?

88
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,080
She's always thinking of
these unnecessary things.

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Where in the universe does she
get her idea of "normal" from?

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Now, you can't just
say that.

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,190
Despite how it may seem,

92
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,360
Miss Suzumiya has a proper
understanding of "normal".

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,590
How do you figure that?

94
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,630
She wants the world
to be more unusual.

95
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,400
And she has the power
to remake the world.

96
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,870
But the world has not lost its rationality.
That's why.

97
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,500
Hey there!
No private discussions!

98
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,170
I hope to get better at sewing.
I hope to get better at cooking.

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,670
I think she might have
the wrong idea about this.

100
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,710
Harmony
Innovation

101
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,840
My family's well-being - Itsuki Koizumi
World Peace - Itsuki Koizumi

102
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,020
Mine might be a bit on
the ordinary side.

103
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,480
Gimme money
Give me a house with a yard big enough
to wash a dog in
Mine might be a bit on
the ordinary side.

104
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,140
Gimme money
Give me a house with a yard big enough
to wash a dog in

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,550
How crass.

106
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,090
Shut it.

107
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,720
Make the world revolve around me.
I want the rotation of the Earth to go
in the opposite direction.
Shut it.

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,810
Make the world revolve around me.
I want the rotation of the Earth to go
in the opposite direction.

109
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,060
Mine are much better
than yours.

110
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,030
It's a difference of values.

111
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,730
Be sure to remember what
you wrote, everyone.

112
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,860
The first checkpoint will be
in sixteen years, after all.

113
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,920
The challenge is to see
whose wish Hikoboshi grants!

114
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,570
Sixteen years, huh?

115
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,870
That's a long time...

116
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,590
After that,

117
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,530
Haruhi was strangely quiet,
and seemed to be melancholy.

118
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,500
Her being so docile was,
strangely enough, eerie.

119
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,360
The quieter she was, the more
I was worried about the backlash.

120
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,360
Would you like some more?

121
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,860
Yes, please.

122
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,640
Shh.

123
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,000
So cute.

124
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,950
Please stay in the club room,
even after we're finished. Mikuru

125
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,950
But of course!

126
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm going home now.

127
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,190
Last person out
lock the door, okay?

128
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,940
In that case,
I'll be going, too.

129
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,430
Lucky me!

130
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,340
Hey...

131
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,240
If you'll excuse me.

132
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,810
Right.

133
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,190
Thank goodness we were able
to stay behind so naturally.

134
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,280
Is this something that it would be bad
for the others to hear?

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,890
Yes...

136
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,100
There's a particular place that
I want you to come with me to.

137
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,330
That's fine.
Where are we going?

138
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,470
Umm...

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,010
Three years... ago...

140
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,170
Thr...

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,170
I'm sorry to be making
such a strange request!

142
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,050
You can't?

143
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,250
So this would be
time travel, then?

144
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,820
Yes, that's right.

145
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm all right
with going, but...

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,920
Why me, and what are we
going to do?

147
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,590
That... You'll know
when we get there.

148
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,020
Probably.

149
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,300
Please, don't ask anything else,
just say yes!

150
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,440
If you don't, then I...

151
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,310
I'll be in trouble...

152
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,780
She's cute!

153
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,470
Well...

154
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay, I'll go.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,620
Really? Thank you!

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,880
So cute!

157
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,720
Oh, thank goodness...

158
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,190
Now that I think about it,

159
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,720
the only time that Miss Asahina's
mentioned she's from the future

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,560
is when she admitted it
to me,

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,330
and the only proof of it is the existence
of the adult Miss Asahina.

162
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,300
This is a perfect chance for me
to confirm

163
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,440
that she's a girl
from the future.

164
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,900
So, where's your
time machine?

165
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,110
We'll be leaving
from here.

166
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,200
From here?

167
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,310
Kyon... I'm sorry.

168
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,220
Oh, you're awake!

169
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,760
Please wake up soon...

170
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,920
My legs have
gone numb.

171
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,710
Why was I asleep?

172
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,270
I'm sorry, but I didn't want you to
see how time jumping is performed.

173
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,610
Because it's classified information...

174
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,480
Umm... are you mad?

175
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
No, not at all.

176
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,090
If it was Haruhi that did it,
I'd hit her.

177
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,360
But since it's you,
it's completely okay.

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,620
Thank goodness.

179
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,390
So it's three years ago?

180
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,930
July seventh,
three years ago.

181
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,600
I'd guess around
nine PM?

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,630
Really?

183
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,790
Really.

184
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,300
This is the same park that Nagato
invited me to some time ago.

185
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,270
Is this a Mecca
for unusual people?

186
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Miss Asahina?

187
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,540
Um...

188
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,060
Could this be some sort of
declaration of intent?

189
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,900
Hello, Kyon.

190
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,270
Miss Asahina!

191
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,000
So this is how I looked
back then.

192
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,520
It was her role
to guide you here.

193
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,450
Guiding you from this point on
is mine.

194
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,220
Are you the one that put
Miss Asahina to sleep?

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,930
I couldn't let her
see me,

196
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,000
because when I was here, as her,
I didn't meet me.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,330
Right...

198
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,830
Down those railroad tracks over there
is a school.

199
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,100
Please help the person
you meet at the school gate.

200
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,510
And I'm sorry, but please give me
a piggyback ride.

201
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,080
This feels kind of like
a game event.

202
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,850
Do I get an item or something
as a reward for doing this?

203
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,780
A reward?

204
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Let's see...

205
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,520
I don't have anything
that I can give you.

206
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,720
But if you want, you can give
the sleeping me there a kiss.

207
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,860
But only while she's asleep.

208
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,630
That's a little...

209
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,830
On an emotional
and on a situational level,

210
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,570
doing that would go against
my principles.

211
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,930
But, well, even still...

212
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,210
It's time.
I have to go.

213
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,410
Also, you have to keep my being here
a secret from her.

214
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,670
Promise me.

215
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,840
Will you pinky swear
with me?

216
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,010
Okay, you've sworn!

217
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,990
Good bye, Kyon.

218
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,220
See you later.

219
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,460
I wonder how long
it's been

220
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,300
since this adult Miss Asahina
and I have seen each other.

221
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,700
It doesn't feel like she's changed
much from the last time I saw her.

222
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,600
But is this really
three years ago?

223
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,810
I need to confirm this,
somehow.

224
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,140
Maybe I should call 411.

225
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,170
East Junior High, huh?

226
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,510
Hey.

227
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,290
Who are you?

228
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,290
It does certainly seem like
I've gone back three years.

229
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,530
This is Haruhi Suzumiya,
currently a seventh grader.

230
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,800
I asked you
who you were.

231
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
A pervert?
A kidnapper?

232
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
What about you,
what are you doing?

233
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,640
Isn't it obvious?
I'm breaking and entering.

234
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,240
How am I supposed to react when you
just admit your illegal activities?

235
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't know
who you are,

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,380
but if you're not doing anything,
then help me out.

237
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,310
If you don't,
I'll report you.

238
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,540
It's Haruhi.
No mistaking it.

239
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,780
This way.

240
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,320
It's a good thing
it's dark out.

241
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,690
This way, she won't be able to
get a good look at our faces.

242
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,030
The Haruhi three years from now
doesn't seem to remember us at all.

243
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,620
So I think that if it wasn't this way,
we'd have problems.

244
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,100
I took it out of the storage room
in the evening and hid it.

245
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,540
Good idea, right?

246
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,960
I'll handle that.
You grab the line marker.

247
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,080
So, what are we doing
with this?

248
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Draw lines the way
I tell you to.

249
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,150
Me?

250
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,520
Right, you.

251
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,420
Because I'm the director.

252
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,130
Hey, the line's shaky over there!
What are you doing!?

253
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,460
Her willingness to order around a
high school student she just met

254
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,630
without any problems
is so very her.

255
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,840
If I had first met her like this,
as a junior high school student,

256
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,770
I probably would have thought
that she was really crazy.

257
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,540
At Haruhi's direction,

258
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,750
I ran this way and that,
drawing white lines.

259
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,480
This was the mysterious message
that Taniguchi had mentioned,

260
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,970
but I never thought that I would be
the one that drew it...

261
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,250
Hmph. It's okay.

262
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,480
Well, excuse me.

263
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,260
Do you think aliens exist?

264
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,430
Well, that was sudden.

265
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,660
Answer the question.

266
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,930
I guess they do.

267
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,300
What about time travelers?

268
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,930
Wouldn't be strange
if there were.

269
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,500
And espers?

270
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,370
There are probably enough of them
to walk in formation.

271
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,810
People from
other dimensions?

272
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,740
I haven't met any
of them yet.

273
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,050
That's the uniform for North High,
isn't it?

274
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,110
Well, yeah.

275
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,620
What's your name?

276
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,950
John Smith.

277
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,190
Are you stupid
or something?

278
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,820
Let's just say that I want
to stay anonymous.

279
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,320
Who's the girl
you were carrying?

280
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,820
My big sister.

281
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,560
She had a sudden case
of narcolepsy.

282
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
She falls asleep regardless
of location,

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,860
so I was carrying her.

284
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,170
Hmph.

285
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,470
So, what in the world
is this?

286
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,000
Can't you tell by looking?
It's a message.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,870
It's not for Orihime
or Hikoboshi, is it?

288
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,540
How did you know that?

289
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,410
Well, it is Tanabata.

290
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,510
I just remembered someone I knew
doing something similar.

291
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,280
Huh. I'd love to meet
that person.

292
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,080
So, that person goes
to North High?

293
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,110
You could say that.

294
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,050
North High, huh?

295
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,660
I'm going home. I've accomplished
my goal, after all.

296
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,830
Bye.

297
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,770
And not even a thanks
for helping her.

298
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,590
Miss Asahina.

299
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,210
Where am I?!

300
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,810
What happened and when
is it right now?!

301
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,000
Umm...

302
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,780
I don't have my TPDD...

303
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,320
Huh?

304
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,990
Huh?
It's gone...

305
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,850
It's gone...

306
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,190
What's wrong?
What's a "TPDD"?

307
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,700
It's classified, but...

308
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,800
It's like a time machine.

309
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Why would it
be gone?

310
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
I don't know.

311
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,830
I should have it,
but I've lost it.

312
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,570
Will anyone come
save us?

313
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,840
There's no way...

314
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,480
So, what's going
to happen to us?

315
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,280
We're stuck like this.

316
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,850
We're going to be left in this time plane,
three years prior,

317
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,320
unable to go back
to our own time!

318
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,290
This is a pretty grave matter.

319
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,920
It is!

320
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,100
But for some reason,
I didn't feel any sense of urgency.

321
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,570
It was probably the adult Miss Asahina
that took that TPDD-thingy.

322
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,340
That's probably why
she came to the past.

323
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,070
As for why, it would
be so that she could

324
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,630
experience losing the TPDD
when she was here.

325
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,850
I think that things are going
to turn out all right.

326
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,180
What?

327
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,160
Is this the home of a
Miss Yuki Nagato?

328
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,390
I'm not really sure
what to say, but...

329
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,800
Will you understand if I say I'm an
acquaintance of Haruhi Suzumiya?

330
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,950
Yo.

331
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,980
Is it all right for us
to come in?

332
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,700
And that is who we are
and why we're here.

333
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,220
Also, the you three years
from now gave me this.

334
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,870
I understand.

335
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,710
As far as you're concerned, this is
the first time we've met, right?

336
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,510
Yes.

337
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,920
Requesting access to the memory of
the unit in the other time plane.

338
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,720
I have downloaded
the information

339
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,190
from the opposite side of
the linked time boundary.

340
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,020
The me that exists three years from now
and I are the same being.

341
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,090
The me three years from now and I
have shared our memories.

342
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,130
How?

343
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,230
We synchronized.

344
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,700
I don't understand.

345
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,070
Why are you wearing
a North High uniform?

346
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,640
Are you already enrolled?

347
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,340
I am not. The current me
is in standby mode.

348
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,610
Standby?

349
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,320
So you intend to be in standby
for almost three years?

350
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,120
Yes.

351
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,920
That sounds like
an awfully long process.

352
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,180
That is my role.

353
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,980
There is more than one way
to travel through time.

354
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,700
The TPDD is not the only device
that can control time.

355
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,500
It's uncertain and primitive.

356
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,270
Umm... What do you mean?

357
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,540
The movement of life forms
that use the TPDD

358
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,270
is within tolerable ranges,
but it creates noise.

359
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,140
To us, it is an
imperfect form.

360
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,050
By "us", do you mean
the Thought Entity?

361
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,020
Miss Nagato, are you able to travel
through time in a perfect form?

362
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,990
The form does not matter.

363
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,780
As long as information can travel
back and forth, it is enough.

364
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,100
You don't mean to say that we
should sleep in here, do you?

365
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,040
Yes.

366
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,610
Together, with Miss Asahina?

367
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,600
Yes.

368
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,040
Lie down.

369
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,540
Lie down.
Straight to the point!

370
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,210
Straight to the point!

371
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,410
You'll just be sleeping.

372
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,180
Well, that's my intention,
too, but...

373
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,950
I... I guess we don't have any choice
but to do what we're told...

374
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,580
Yes...

375
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,910
What, really?

376
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
What's the matter?

377
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,160
Is that the TPDD?

378
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,390
No, this is simply
a radio wave watch.

379
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,100
Thank goodness,
we're back.

380
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,090
It's just after 9:30 PM on the July 7th
that we left from.

381
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,270
How did you do it?

382
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,580
I suspended the flow of information
inside of a selected time-space.

383
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,480
I then released
the time suspension

384
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,310
at a pre-designated point in
the time-space continuum.

385
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,580
You mean you stopped time?!

386
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,040
Miss Nagato stopped time
in this room for three years.

387
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,430
And when today came around,
she released the time stop... right?

388
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,230
Yes.

389
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,990
I can't believe it!

390
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,990
Which means,
in other words...

391
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,370
That time when you told me
you were an alien and stuff...

392
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,800
Miss Asahina and I were in
the next room, asleep?

393
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,700
Yes.

394
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,440
I always thought that you
were pretty clever,

395
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,250
but you're actually omnipotent,
aren't you?

396
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,550
That's not true.

397
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,250
This was a special case.

398
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,780
Emergency mode.

399
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,220
It doesn't happen often.
It has to be something rare.

400
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,090
Thank you.

401
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,320
It was nothing.

402
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,230
Can you read
what this says?

403
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,760
"I am here."

404
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,600
That's what it says.

405
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,240
Could it be that it's written in
the language of some alien race?

406
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,640
Nagato didn't answer me.

407
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,910
I'm sorry.
Actually, I...

408
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,250
I don't really understand.

409
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm just an underling...

410
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,260
No, not even that.

411
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,400
I mean, I'm more like
a trainee, so...

412
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,400
And yet you're hanging around
with Haruhi.

413
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,390
Well, I never thought that
Miss Suzumiya would catch me!

414
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,950
All I do is obey the orders
of my superior...

415
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,550
Maybe I should say the
people above me.

416
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,680
So sometimes I don't understand
the things that I'm doing.

417
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,400
I wonder if her superior
is the adult Miss Asahina.

418
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,230
The adult Miss Asahina had to know
how things turned out for us.

419
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,190
But it looks like she didn't tell
this Miss Asahina any of it.

420
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,310
I guess that people from the future
have their own rules and laws.

421
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,280
I'm sure that someone
will tell her.

422
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,340
When everything falls
into place.

423
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,650
The next day was,
of course, July eighth.

424
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,420
Consciously I knew that
it was the next day,

425
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
but physically, it had been
three years and a day

426
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,520
since I had come
to school.

427
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,870
What's wrong? Did you eat a poison
mushroom or something?

428
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,670
Not really. I'm just melancholy
from remembering some stuff.

429
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,760
Memories from
previous Tanabatas.

430
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,600
Is that so?

431
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,210
Hey, Nagato.

432
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,680
Miss Asahina really is
from the future, right?

433
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,580
Yes.

434
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,650
If that's the case, it feels like
the processes that link

435
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,190
the past and the future
don't quite add up right.

436
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,650
What do you mean?

437
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,290
Previously, Miss
Asahina said that

438
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,990
there's no connection between
the past and the future.

439
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,930
But in going back
three years,

440
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,160
I provided Haruhi with knowledge
she didn't need.

441
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,100
She ended up coming
to North High,

442
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,500
and she started looking for people
who weren't normal...

443
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,730
There's a chance
that's why.

444
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,840
There's a definite connection between
the past and the future.

445
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,280
This contradicts the explanation
that Miss Asahina gave me.

446
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,050
A contradictory set of theories
cannot explain its own contradictions.

447
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,420
Is that supposed to be
an explanation?

448
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,950
You'll eventually understand.

449
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,860
This is what she means.

450
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,640
Right now, my king is currently
in check by your rook.

451
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,800
"Oh no, what do I do?
Where shall I flee to?"

452
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,980
Now, what was contradictory
about what I just did?

453
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,290
In our case, the king really
isn't all that important.

454
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,360
What's important to us
is the queen.

455
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,650
I see.

456
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,230
I don't know when something
will happen next,

457
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,660
but when it does, I hope it doesn't
require so much thinking.

458
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,030
I'd prefer that things stay
nice and peaceful.

459
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,360
Would you prefer for
something to happen?

460
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,260
Why, you!

461
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,550
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

462
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,290
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

463
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,890
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

464
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,160
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

465
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,800
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

466
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,970
Tashika ni oboeteru tte

Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

467
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,510
Tomare!
Stop!

468
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,280
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

469
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,850
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

470
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,180
Nazenara
That's because

471
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,450
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

472
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,220
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

473
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,690
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

474
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,560
Doushiyouka tte nayanda koto mo
Worrying about "what do I do?"

475
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,470
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo

Is laughable when I
think about it now

476
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,170
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

477
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,230
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
