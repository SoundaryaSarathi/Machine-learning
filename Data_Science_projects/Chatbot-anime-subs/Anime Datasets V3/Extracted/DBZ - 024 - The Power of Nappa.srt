00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:23,276
There, there...

2
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,177
Y- Yamucha...

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,055
Pu-erh!

4
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,216
Hey, Pu-erh!

5
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,549
Stay with me! Hey!

6
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,496
Pu-erh too, huh?

7
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:51,369
My, my, the sofa is going
to be all full at this rate.

8
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,683
Come on, Bulma, take heart.

9
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:03,780
What are you talking about!?
How can I be calm with Yamucha dying!?

10
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,060
You don't have to worry about Yamucha.

11
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,705
This is the first time
Yamucha has died, right?

12
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,402
We can always bring him back to life
with the Dragon Balls, can't we?

13
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,047
That's right! That's right, isn't it?

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,208
Yes, that's right!

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,486
You dirty old man!

16
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,563
What a pathetic Saibaiman-
ending in a draw!

17
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:52,599
What did he think he was doing,
against scum like that!?

18
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,677
Hey, clean that up.
He's dirtying up the place.

19
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,838
That pile of filth.

20
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:08,383
You dirty bastard!

21
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,518
Get back, everyone!

22
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:32,673
Let me show you
the results of my training!

23
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,245
Go!

24
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:49,327
What is that-

25
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,227
slow-moving blast?

26
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,189
We'll be caught in the blast!

27
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:59,404
It's got tremendous energy,
but almost no speed at all.

28
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:01,269
It's like it's saying,
"Get out of the way!"

29
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,564
You did it!

30
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:43,047
He did it! He did it!

31
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:50,989
He did it! He did it!
He did it! He did it!

32
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:57,553
H- hold on, B- Bulma...
L- let me go...

33
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,666
I- incredible!

34
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,668
Kuririn, are you okay?

35
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:07,195
Yeah. But I missed one of them.

36
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:26,983
Burn in hell!

37
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:51,316
<i>Just what you'd expect from Piccolo.</i>

38
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:54,342
<i>l shudder to think about him</i>
<i>becoming my enemy again someday.</i>

39
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:59,324
Thank you, Piccolo-<i>san</i>.

40
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:02,418
Don't get the wrong idea.
You think I would save you?

41
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:10,259
I was just warming up for the marvelous
battle that is about to get underway.

42
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,434
Assuming that's the kind of
fight it turns out to be...

43
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:32,517
Well then, as you wish, how about
we put an end to the games?

44
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,892
This means it's time for the real thing!

45
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,295
<i>lmpossible! lt had hardly</i>
<i>any effect on him at all!</i>

46
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:45,768
<i>They were hit dead-on!</i>

47
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,800
I- I did that at full power!

48
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,349
So that's what a Saiyan is, is it?

49
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:15,333
Please let me handle them. I'll put all
five of them away in the blink of an eye.

50
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,335
Do as you like.

51
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,003
However...

52
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,733
...do not kill the Namekian.

53
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,346
We'll need to get him to tell us
about the Dragon Balls afterward.

54
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,371
Yes, understood.

55
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:42,015
Now then, entertain me
the best that you can. First off...

56
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,185
I'll start with you!

57
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,090
Let me handle this!

58
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,118
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

59
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:13,522
Looks like this is
going to be somewhat fun!

60
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,126
What?

61
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:55,197
T- the ground is shaking!

62
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,974
I- it's no use!

63
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,976
Ten-<i>san</i>!

64
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,979
M- my telekinetic powers aren't working!

65
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,674
T- this can't be!

66
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,324
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

67
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,994
Stand firm, Gohan!

68
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,663
B- but!

69
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,665
Control your <i>Ki</i>!

70
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,668
Don't let yourself be
browbeaten by this level of <i>Ki</i>!

71
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:31,896
R- right!

72
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,309
<i>S</i>- <i>still, I had no idea</i>
<i>it would be this bad...</i>

73
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,712
Hmm? Is that-?

74
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,612
The Snake Princess' palace.

75
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,062
W- what was that just now?

76
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,393
Beats me.

77
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:37,401
If memory serves, that was the
midpoint of the Serpentine Road.

78
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,892
All right, everyone, just you wait!

79
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:08,484
Chaozu! Be careful!

80
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,374
H- here he comes!

81
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:28,607
Now then, which one of you
shall I take care of first?

82
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:01,840
Tenshinhan!

83
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,780
Get out of there!

84
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,353
Ten-<i>san</i>!

85
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,038
Hmph! What fragile folk.

86
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,165
Now to finish you!

87
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,680
You filthy bastard!

88
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,921
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

89
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:04,634
That's one tough bastard.
He's still alive.

90
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,878
W- what power he has!

91
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,691
Dammit! Tenshinhan!

92
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:22,026
Wait!

93
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,494
He's had it! Leave him alone!

94
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,499
Don't interrupt!

95
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:03,934
I can't see the bottom
of the hole! Unbelievable!

96
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:06,198
What an incredible energy wave!

97
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,100
C- Chaozu!

98
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,772
Was he done in just now!?

99
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:22,910
Chaozu!

100
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,024
Don't worry!

101
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:30,892
I'll send you to him soon enough-
in the next world!

102
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,122
<i>D</i>- <i>damn...</i>

103
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,199
Nappa! Look behind you!

104
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,374
Chaozu!

105
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,042
Why, you!

106
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,712
When did you get back there!?
Come on, let go!

107
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,981
Why, you... why, you... runt!

108
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,983
Come on!

109
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:54,883
Come on!

110
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,960
Chaozu! Get away from him!

111
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,341
Chaozu-<i>san</i>!

112
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,343
Look at him.

113
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:23,013
Look at him! Don't turn away.

114
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,947
This is what fighting is.

115
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:32,690
You're a persistent one!

116
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,360
Chaozu! That's enough!
Get away from him!

117
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,294
T- Ten-<i>san</i>...

118
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:42,332
Thank you.

119
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,660
W- what are you saying... Chaozu?

120
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,872
Get away from there!
Get away from there, now!

121
00:15:56,313 --> 00:16:02,081
I enjoyed... being together...
with you...

122
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:08,955
Chaozu! What are you thinking!?

123
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:21,134
Farewell, Ten-<i>san</i>. Please don't die.

124
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,010
D- don't tell me... you're-!

125
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,138
Farewell. Farewell!

126
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,063
Stop! Chaozu!

127
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,231
Farewell!

128
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,470
Chaozu!!

129
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,621
Blowing himself up
and taking them both out-

130
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,689
that was a pretty drastic thing to do.

131
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,283
For a little squirt,
that was nicely done.

132
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,653
That was a worthless thing to do!

133
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:19,990
Nappa, he sure gave you
a lot of trouble, considering.

134
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,663
I- i- it can't be! How can he
be unfazed!? T- that's awful!

135
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,292
Chaozu even gave up his life!

136
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,007
Chaozu has already been brought
back to life with the Dragon Balls.

137
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:42,346
He can't be brought back
to life again! Dammit!

138
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:44,746
You're going to pay for this!

139
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:54,024
It looks like you still don't
realize how fearsome we are!

140
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:57,482
The only thing you have
coming to you is death!

141
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,712
<i>The warriors are falling, one by one.</i>

142
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:17,915
<i>ls there anything that Tenshinhan</i>
<i>and the others can do</i>

143
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,050
