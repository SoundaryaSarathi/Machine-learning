1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,107
It is the end of the 1990's.

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:11,111
Japan was suffering the greatest
economic recession since the War.

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,780
What with the repeated chain
reactions of bankrupcies...

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,982
...an increasing unemployment rate,

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,552
atrocious crimes committed by
juveniles, and so on...

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,527
...it had become a place and an
era fit to be manipulated by the
image created by the phrase The End is Near.

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,962
Also at this time,

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:34,034
the masked honor student Miyazawa Yukino,
in class 1-A of the Kanazawa Prefectural
Hokuei High School...

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,002
...was the ultimate Queen of Vanity.

10
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,971
Arima Souichirou, the one who changed her,

11
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,042
was a real model student who tried to
bear all his misery by himself.

12
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,911
After a lot of fuss,

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,215
these two came to share a secret
as model students with dual personalities.

14
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,217
Later, after passing through
phases as partners in the Student Assembly,

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,185
...good friends,

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,255
and more than friends but not quite lovers,

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,291
they finally became a couple.

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,361
These two, affected by each other,

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,832
decided to live for their own true happiness.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,736
Miyazawa Yukino savors her transient happiness.

21
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,305
But the world was harsh.

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,709
The menace of the Athletic Festival,
the campus event which forced them to be...

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,680
...super busy and unable to see each other,
as though it was testing their relationship;

24
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,720
The appearance of the wanton, perverted,
heart-throb Asaba Hideaki, who criticized her...

25
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,789
hoping to break them up, while plotting to
use Arima once he became single again,

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,692
...in order to carry out his ambition,
the Asaba Mary-Land project;

27
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,596
The drop in their semester finals grades
 which resulted from their yielding to...

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,632
...thier love-power and totally goofing off...

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,570
and her resulting unilateral feelings of alienation;

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,873
And in addition, interference and pressure
from the teachers at school,

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,411
who were trying to end their academic slump,
which came to even involve their parents;

35
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,749
The incident where Miyazawa Yukino was ignored
by all the girls in the class,...

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,819
...led by Isawa Maho who had
independently analyzed Miyazawa
and saw through to her true nature;

40
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:04,657
A series of physical attacks from
the envious Shibahime Tsubasa,...

42
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,627
...who had been in love with Arima
since junior high school;

44
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,265
The brief separation from Arima
due to summer club activities;

46
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,200
Another family's remarriage issues;

47
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,371
...and so on; The storms of life
buffeted her one after another.

49
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,674
But she endured
the onslaught of challenges,...

50
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,876
...made new friends in spite of them,

51
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,179
and steadily level-upped her life experience.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,217
Meanwhile, Arima, unable to cope
with his own reality anymore...

55
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,353
...reveals his dependence on Miyazawa Yukino.

56
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,490
Accepting this,
Yukino yields herself to him.

58
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,927
She finally did it!

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,631
And another peaceful day was about to begin.

62
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,667
But, however!

63
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,669
Good morning! Let's eat!

64
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,000
Thanks for the meal!

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,608
We're off! Have a nice day!

66
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,245
The second semester has started.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,050
A lot of stuff sure happened
over summer vacation.

69
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,819
We all went to karaoke, and raised hell,...

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,621
Tsubasa-chan came to sleep over,

71
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,390
and things got ugly...

72
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,891
Asapin came over,

73
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,626
and Dad raised hell...

74
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,495
we went to Grandpa's,

75
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,163
and Dad raised hell...

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,731
We all went to a coffee shop,

77
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,566
and raised hell...

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,834
I went to Mahorin's place,

79
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,737
and Mahorin's going out with a dentist...

80
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,873
Arima came back, and we smooched...

81
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,608
we went on a date, and smooched...

82
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,411
I went to Arima's place, and smooched...

83
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,012
I went to Arima's place again,

84
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,083
and smooched, after that...
...after that...
...after that...

85
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,102
Arima! Mornin'!

86
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,236
Morning.

87
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,672
I never see you going to school
at the normal time.

88
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,040
I didn't have morning practice today.

90
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, if you had told me I would have arranged to meet up somewhere.

91
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,614
Miyazawa...But when I called
last night you weren't home.

92
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,385
Oh, it must have been during my family's summer karaoke fest.

93
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,520
I joined them for just an hour.

94
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,890
Every so often I long to hear my dad sing.

96
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,593
But why just an hour?

97
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,000
Why, because today is the first day
of class after summer vacation when
they hold the aptitude tests,

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,002
I'm out to win back my position as first
place for the first time in a while.

101
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,538
I'm sorry, but I want to stay first after all!

102
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,608
Not second, nor third, nor fourth, NO!

104
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,210
It has to be first!

105
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,480
I'd been withheld for a while
after entering high school,

106
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,448
I'd been withheld for a while
after entering high school,
(Text:Here's some second place)

107
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,417
so I'm practically in withdrawal!

108
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,987
Which means, before a test, we're mortal
enemies vying for supremacy!

111
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,123
Don't come up to me and be all buddy-buddy.

112
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,458
But we're not usually like that.

113
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,193
We're always lovey-dovey.

114
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,599
Could we be any more lovey-dovey?!!
We're like lovers!

116
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,003
Oh my gosh, what if like
someone was to like, see us?!?

118
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,206
Now then, I better hurry to school and study.

119
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,074
See ya!

120
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,910
She was the one who came up to me...

121
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,839
Souichirou-kun! Miyazawa!

122
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,708
Aloha!

123
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,012
M:A...A...Asapin!!
A:I...I can't believe you!

125
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,180
Yeah!

126
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,916
There you go over-accessorizing again!

127
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,751
What's with all that metal, huh?!

128
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,387
As a model student I don't want to be
associated with a guy who looks like...

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,725
...he partied through the entire summer
vacation like his life depended on it!

132
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,829
K...Kawashima-sensei!

133
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,868
I...It's the dean, Kawashima-sensei!

134
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,837
You're in for it now.

136
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,842
You'll get shaved bald
and given another long vacation!

139
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,420
Just don't go too far.

140
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,955
Okaay!

141
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:03,790
To think he has to take care

142
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,226
of such an alien at his age...

143
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:07,727
I feel so sorry for him.

144
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,462
Look, his hair's falling out.

145
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,833
Yo! Let's have lunch!

146
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,068
Yo!

147
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,002
Long time no see.

148
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,772
What, with your husband again?

149
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,240
It's too hot for comfort with
you all over each other.

150
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,477
Don't flirt in front of us, it's annoying.

152
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,112
We're NOT flirting!!
(Text:We're going to talk about homeroom!)

153
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,148
What, Hideaki, nothing but bread for lunch?

154
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:29,816
Doesn't matter.

155
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,652
Here, I'll split some of mine with you.
You should think about your nutrition more.

156
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,723
Feed him.

157
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,092
Moron, what're you thinking?

158
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,860
Come on, see, aah.

159
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,697
Hmm... two guys together aren't that bad either.

161
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,032
Makes lunch taste better, doesn't it?

162
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,202
It's still so hot.

163
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,071
What are we going to do in homeroom?

164
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,939
To talk about the Culture Fair.

165
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,775
Great, here come the busy days again.

166
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,777
When's the Culture Fair?

167
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,346
September 15.

168
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,849
It's a bit unreasonable to tell us to
prepare the Culture Fair in just two weeks

170
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,618
I heard the sports teams have
been preparing all summer.

172
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,922
I guess the point is that nobody can
get into study mode in this heat.

174
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,025
The girls volleyball team is
getting together with the girls
judo team to do a hostess lounge!

176
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,827
Party with the babes!

177
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,862
The crafts club is going to make a dollhouse!

178
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,497
Great. Sounds like fun.

179
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,466
So what? You have your husband.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,701
Stop calling me husband, Sakura!

181
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,437
Aren't you going to walk around with
Arima and see all the booths?

182
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,906
If I have time...

183
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,211
We're probably going to be forced
to be in multiple committees again.

185
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:37,584
So while everyone else is having fun
we'll be barely conscious, running
around covered in sweat and dust.

188
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,554
I have almost no memories of
the end of the Athletics Festival.

190
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,657
Smart people sure have it rough.

191
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,327
Tsubasa-chan, are you doing
anything for the Culture Fair?

192
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,463
Tsubasa-chan, your hairstyle is so cute.

193
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,098
Let's do some bonding!

194
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,771
Well, you know how she is, I better
give her some candy to keep her quiet.

196
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,974
Is she some kind of animal?
How about you, Maho-san?

197
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,009
I'm not interested in school activities,

198
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,744
so I'll be at home asleep.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,047
Asapin?

200
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,582
Oh, I don't know.
I'll just do whatever my class does.

201
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,986
Other than that, I guess I'll
do some girl hunting.

202
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,789
Oh. You guys just aren't into this at all.

203
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,224
Young people these days are so apathetic.

204
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,393
It's just that you're so gung-ho, Tsubaki.

205
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,295
I'm sure you'll have fun doing the hostess lounge.

206
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,329
You think so?

207
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,334
I wish I could just stay home
and sleep like Maho-san.

208
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,969
I feel tired just thinking about it.

209
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,573
What's Aya-chan up to?

210
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,874
Writing.

211
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,177
Mmmmmm?

212
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,020
Sorry for making you take the test
in a separate room.

214
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,991
I thought the best place to
introduce a transfer student
would be in afternoon homeroom.

216
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,361
How does it feel being back in
this town after three years...

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,230
...Tonami-kun?

218
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,908
We'll be starting homeroom now.

219
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,878
We're going to discuss the Culture Fair,
which will be held on the 15th of this month...

221
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,949
...as outlined on the printouts that were
just handed out by the Student Council.

223
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,052
Well actually, Arima and I are busy,
so you guys decide what

226
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,721
you're going to do by yourselves,
and just do whatever. That is all.

227
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,824
Hey, do you think the class
representative can get away with that?!

228
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,027
Think about the class more seriously!

231
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:32,265
Oh, shut up. I don't want to think
seriously about anything except exams.

232
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,468
Not fair! What a rotten representative!

233
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,237
Say what you want.

234
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,008
I'd rather go home and be cleaning out my ears
than do something I have nothing to gain in.

237
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:42,976
How irresponsible!

238
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,010
Do your job!

239
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,278
What kind of service is that?!

240
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,981
I said, I don't care!

241
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,150
No way! I can't believe this!

242
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,685
There's something interesting written here.

243
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,155
After the conclusion of the Culture Fair,
an all-around winner will be announced...

246
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,558
...from among the participating groups
based on profit and number of customers.

247
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,394
However, if it is determined
by the executive committee

248
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,630
that there was excessive soliciting,
they would be disqualified.

249
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,734
The winning group will be able
to choose one of the following:

250
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:16,910
* Gift certificates for Korean BBQ,
* Right to choose the destination for the fall fieldtrip,
* Copies of all notes taken during school by an alumni who got into Tokyo University,

254
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,244
Gift certificates for Korean BBQ!

255
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,579
Destination for the fall fieldtrip!

256
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,948
A copy of those notes!!

257
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,249
So that's why people seemed
way too into the Culture Fair

258
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,552
when I came to see it while
visiting schools last year.

259
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,388
No wonder the sports clubs have
been preparing all summer.

260
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,957
Everone else is at a disadvantage.

261
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,061
SILENCE! Let's talk about it.

262
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,000
And this is the person who was
just telling us to do whatever...

264
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,137
That voice!

265
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,040
It's dark!

266
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,174
I can't see anything!

267
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,177
1-A has no chance of winning
no matter how much you talk!

268
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,312
Say what?!

269
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,121
The all-around winner is going to be 1-F.

270
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,557
Asapin! You're so disgusting.

271
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,658
What do you want?

273
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:11,464
You sound pretty confident.
What did 1-F decide to do?
(Text:But still the girls gather)

274
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:13,833
Us?

275
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:18,405
The Asaba Hideaki Dinner Show!

276
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,306
Huh?

277
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,510
Asaba Hideaki Dinner Show?

278
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,000
Huh?
(Text:The girls want to go already)

279
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,916
I'll be waiting with my
pheromones at full blast.

280
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,521
Adios, my lovely little kittens.

281
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,092
D...D....

282
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,127
DAMMIT! Now what do we do?!

283
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,530
I hate to admit it, but even 10 of
us together are no match for

284
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,031
the pheromones he has by himself!

285
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,599
No kidding.

286
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,470
Arima! You should do it too!
Don't worry, we can win!

288
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,771
Like hell, what are you thinking?!

289
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,441
Arima-kun too?!

290
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,343
Do you want us to lose?!

291
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,111
You're our class representative!

292
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,612
I said I'm not doing it!!

293
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,614
Think of your class!
(Eyes:The Best)

294
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,550
Now, strip! C'mon!

295
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,652
Miyazawa, y...you have a glazed look in your eyes!

296
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,788
NOOOO!!

297
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:12,892
Rika-chan, Rika-chan!

298
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:13,760
What's up?

299
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,863
A new student just transferred into our class.

300
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,632
He's so cool! Check him out!

301
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,568
His name is Tonami Takefumi-kun,

302
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,136
and he came from Okinawa!

303
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,537
Tonami Takefumi?

304
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,379
Do you know him?

305
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,481
Oh...Um... no, it must be someone else.

306
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,585
Oh, but I hear Tonami-kun
used to live around here.

308
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,690
Sena Rika...

309
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,561
What? Takefumi's HERE?!

310
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,629
It must be someone else.

311
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,998
I thought it might be him too, but he was a totally different person.

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I guess there are people with the same name.

313
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,803
Oh...

314
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,405
Ahhh, Takefumi...
it really brings back memories.

315
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,073
I hope he didn't get picked on in Okinawa.

316
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,210
What?

317
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,812
Aren't you the one who'd be in the most hot water if Tonami came back?

318
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,346
Why?

320
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:11,000
You've quieted down a lot recently, but you
were really mean back in middle school.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,989
You used Tonami as your gopher, or rather,
your lackey or even, your very own servant.

324
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,024
I bet Tonami really resented it.

325
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,426
You'll definitely be a target
for revenge some day.

326
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,299
Sakura Tsubaki.

327
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,337
I'm opposed!

328
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,240
Should we allow such an extremely
frivolous feature as a dinner show...

330
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,710
...at the Culture Fair of the
renowned Hokuei High School?

331
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,178
This only has profits in mind

332
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,448
and deviates from the original
objective of a Culture Fair!
(Text: *Culture* fair)

334
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,552
But the girls sports teams' hostess
lounge has been approved...

336
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,253
Huh?

337
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,458
It appears that 1-A is concerned
that we will have high profits.

339
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,360
They must be really afraid of us.

340
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,461
Who are you?

341
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,198
Fukada Kouhei, 1-F representative.

342
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,968
The proposer of the Asaba Hideaki
Dinner Show project.

344
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,436
The producer, I suppose.

345
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:08,608
Who the hell is this guy?!
He's really annoying, especially his face.

347
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,412
Do you really think you can hold
a dinner show in a high school?!
Stop it at once!

349
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,415
I'll never give it up!

350
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,718
1-A never had a chance of winning.

351
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,721
The overall winner will be 1-F.

352
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,392
1-A is sure to finish last...
LAST!

354
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,729
Last?!

355
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:30,797
Don't say that!

356
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,665
Miyazawa's going to...

357
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,700
Ah

358
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,008
I'm number one!!

359
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,311
I SAID, 1-F will be number one!

360
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,734
Well, when I hear words like first
place and profit, my battle-thirsty
blood gets boiling.

363
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,804
And you were just saying that you weren't interested in the Culture Fair.

364
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,776
I hate to admit it, but this
dinner show is a good plan.

366
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:22,082
It's a good choice that thoroughly makes
the most of pheromone-boy's sexy energy.

368
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,752
And we shouldn't underestimate Fukada's
producing and political power.

371
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,889
1-A is rather lacking in a winning tactic.

372
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,324
Even if we can't take first place,

373
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,560
it'll be enough if everyone in 1-A has fun.

374
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,397
How disgustingly beautiful!

375
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,299
I can't stand such pure ideals!

376
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,268
There's no point if you can't come in first!

378
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,730
Oh, um... we're all alone, aren't we.

379
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,503
Your body...

380
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,609
...how is it.

381
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,178
I'm a guy, so I don't know much
about that kind of thing...

382
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,881
Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry.

384
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,083
Besides, how should I put it...

385
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,154
I was so happy.

386
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,188
Happy?

387
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,658
You're always gentle when you touch me.

388
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,996
I can tell that you care about me.

390
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh, I do try to do that for you too,

391
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,469
although I end up kicking and
hitting you all the time!

393
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,637
But I do have good intentions!

394
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,389
Doing work together like this really makes
me realize we're back in school again.

395
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,200
Yeah.

396
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,727
I wonder if we won't be able to see each other
much like during the Athletics Festival.

397
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,696
Who knows. I wouldn't want to think about that.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
As long as you are by my side, I am...

399
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,864
Sis, welcome home!

400
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,132
I'm home!

401
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,300
Let's eat!

402
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,039
Thanks for the meal! Good night!

403
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,650
Yaay! It's done!

404
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,653
Hooray! Great job!

405
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,121
What?

406
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,190
What've you been writing since yesterday?

407
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,694
Oh, just a little screenplay.

408
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,998
Tsubaki said before that our group
has talent well suited for a play, right?

410
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,800
Well, that gave me an idea.

411
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,635
I've been thinking about it all vacation.

412
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,471
Rika and Tsubaki have their
clubs, so they can't do it.

413
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:35,141
But the three people with nothing to do are
really distinctive, so it was easy to write up.

415
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,544
I think this would really work if we did it in public.

416
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,047
Oh, those three are Yukinon,

417
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,282
Maho-san, and Tsubasa.

418
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,086
How about we do this at the Culture Fair?

419
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,555
Ah?

421
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,221
The new semester opens with a storm!

422
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,057
Sis runs about trying to escape Aya-chan's evil reach.

423
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,625
But unrelated to that,

424
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,660
Tonami Takefumi's surprising past comes to light!

425
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,962
What is his relationship with Tsubaki?!

426
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,330
See next Act
