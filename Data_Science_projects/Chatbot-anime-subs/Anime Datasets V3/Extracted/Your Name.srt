1
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,974
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,811
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

3
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,482
<i>The dream I must have had
I can never recall.</i>

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,984
But...

5
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,485
But...

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,822
<i>the sensation that I've lost something</i>

7
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,617
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

8
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>I'm always searching</i>

9
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,005
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:33,385
<i>This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...</i>

11
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

12
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

13
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,769
<i>as if a scene from a dream.</i>

14
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

15
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

16
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

17
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,274
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

18
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,528
My name is...

19
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,947
Mitsuha!

20
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,444
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

21
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,989
Well, they feel incredibly realistic...

22
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,950
What? "Mitsuha"?

23
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,661
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

24
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,830
Hurry UP!

25
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,185
What? What?

26
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you want last night's leftovers?

27
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,990
You can have it.

28
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,159
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,828
Mitsuha, you're late!

30
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,121
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

31
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,045
Is this too much?

32
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,713
Oh well.

33
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,632
You're normal today.

34
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,051
You were nuts yesterday.

35
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,303
What are you talking about?

36
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,058
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

37
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.</i>

38
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,733
<i>Regarding the Mayoral election</i>

39
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,405
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

40
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:12,372
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

41
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,002
<i>The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

42
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,004
Just make up with him.

43
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,380
It's an adult matter.

44
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,758
<i>"Position of Comet</i> Tiamat" <i>We are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

45
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
We're going now!

46
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,425
Study hard!

47
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,015
Mitsuha!

48
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,017
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

49
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,060
Morning.

50
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,021
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

51
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,814
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

52
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
You two get along so well.

53
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
We do not!

54
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,531
Your hair looks all right today.

55
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,699
What?

56
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,536
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

57
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,413
You were totally possessed!

58
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:40,919
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

59
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,755
Huh? What are you talking about?

60
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,048
You don't remember?

61
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,051
And above all

62
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:53,723
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

63
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,017
Only when these are achieved

64
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,562
can a safe and secure community
be created!

65
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,148
As the incumbent Mayor...

66
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,985
He'll be re-elected again anyway.

67
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,570
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

68
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,656
Hey, Miyamizu.

69
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,907
Morning.

70
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,869
So the Mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

71
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,079
Ew.

72
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,835
Mitsuha!

73
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,713
Stand up straight!

74
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,591
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

75
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,094
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

76
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,596
Mitsuha.

77
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,516
In front of everybody...

78
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,104
"Who are you?"

79
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,114
"Tasokare"

80
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:54,138
"Tasokare" means "Twilight" and is

81
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,240
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki"

82
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,914
Twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

83
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:05,628
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something supernatural.

84
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,008
Older expressions include
"Karetaso-doki"

85
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,344
"Karetaso = Twilight"

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Question! Not "Kataware-doki"?

87
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

88
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,022
I've heard that ltomori's elderly
still use the old language.

89
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,530
We're in the boonies, after all.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
"Who are you?"

91
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,612
OK next, Mitsuha.

92
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,113
Yes.

93
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,159
Oh, so you remember your name today?

94
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,163
You don't remember?

95
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,377
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

96
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,339
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

97
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,469
What? No way! Really?

98
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
It was like you had amnesia.

99
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,351
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

100
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,854
A dream about someone else's life?

101
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,066
I can't remember clearly.

102
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,652
I know! That was...

103
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,986
your previous life!

104
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,116
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

105
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,408
Stay out of this.

106
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,079
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

107
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,165
Nothing.

108
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,878
But Mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

109
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,131
You been feeling alright?

110
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,343
That's so strange. I feel fine.

111
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,305
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

112
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,016
Oh, don't remind me!

113
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,394
I can't stand this town anymore.

114
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:50,692
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

115
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing here.

116
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,367
Trains come every 2 hours.

117
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,411
The store closes at 8:00 p.m.

118
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,371
No bookstore. No dentist.

119
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,915
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"
But 2 pubs for some reason.

120
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
No jobs.

121
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,168
No brides.

122
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,170
Short daylight hours.

123
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,716
- Give me a break!
- What?

124
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,344
I mean... How about we stop by a café?

125
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,679
- A café?
- Really?

126
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,181
Where?

127
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,561
Hello.

128
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
Hello.

129
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,569
This is a café?

130
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,696
You know there isn't one.

131
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,365
Mitsuha just went home.

132
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,952
Things must be rough for her.

133
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,413
Well, she takes center stage.

134
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,915
Yeah.

135
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,252
Hey, Tessie.

136
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,046
What?

137
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,882
What will you do after you graduate?

138
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,760
What's this?
You asking about my future?

139
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:06,059
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

140
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,743
I'd rather do that, Grandma.

141
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,496
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

142
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,957
Listen to the thread's voice.

143
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,293
When you keep twining like that

144
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,631
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

145
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,258
Threads don't talk.

146
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,551
She means, "Focus".

147
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:46,349
1000 years of ltomori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

148
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,270
Listen. 200 years ago...

149
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,021
Here she goes again.

150
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:58,778
Sandal maker Mayugoro's bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

151
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,240
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

152
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,950
and this is known as...

153
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,994
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

154
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,956
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

155
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,629
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

156
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,592
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

157
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,097
That's the important task
we at Miyamizu Shrine have.

158
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,812
But that foolish son-in-law...

159
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:38,026
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough

160
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,029
Now politics? He's hopeless.

161
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,489
Have another, my man.

162
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,911
I'm counting on your help again.

163
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,246
Leave it to me.

164
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,125
You'll get votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.

165
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,543
How's it going with her?

166
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
It's not that easy.

167
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,424
I smell corruption.

168
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,259
Don't be ridiculous.

169
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,928
Bring us more hot sake.

170
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,221
OK.

171
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,891
Katsuhiko, work the site this weekend.

172
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,143
Learn how to use explosives.

173
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,270
Can't hear you.

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,271
Yes!

175
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,913
We both have it rough, don't we?

176
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,059
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

177
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,812
They're both pretty like their mother.

178
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,564
Hey.

179
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,774
Hey.

180
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,600
It's the oldest sake in the world.

181
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,565
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

182
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,611
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
sake made that way?

183
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,488
Of course they do.

184
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,826
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

185
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh! I could never do that!

186
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,544
Isn't she embarrassed?

187
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,421
I can't believe it.

188
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,732
Cheer up, Mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

189
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,943
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

190
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,823
Why not sell lots of Kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

191
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,451
Where do you get these ideas?

192
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:38,831
Sell them with photos and videos.
Name it: "Shrine Maiden's Sake".

193
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,708
You'll make money!

194
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,794
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

195
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,547
No. That breaks the Liquor Law!

196
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,842
That's the problem?

197
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,103
I hate this town! I hate this life!

198
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,525
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

199
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
What a fool...

200
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,560
Ow!

201
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,398
Ouch...

202
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,283
Where...

203
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,588
Something's there...

204
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,477
Ow!

205
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
Taki! Are you up?

206
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,152
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

207
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,486
I'm sorry.

208
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,325
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

209
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,492
OK.

210
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,455
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

211
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,333
Have a nice day.

212
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,720
What a strange dream.

213
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,350
"From Tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

214
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,355
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

215
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,033
I have to use the bathroom.

216
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,752
This dream is too realistic.

217
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,096
"Shinjuku Station"

218
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,992
I'm in Tokyo.

219
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,623
"Jingu High School"

220
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,625
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

221
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,627
The opening act at the next gig...

222
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,630
Let's skip study hall and go to a movie.

223
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,636
Taki!

224
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,433
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

225
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,102
You ignored my text.

226
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,979
Oh, Tsukasa?

227
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,899
At least you sound sorry.

228
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,903
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

229
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,656
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

230
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,327
- Uh... Well... I (watashi)...
- Feminine?

231
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,870
I (watakushi)!

232
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,580
I (boku)?

233
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:30,915
I (ore)?

234
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:38,839
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

235
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,425
You seem to have a dialect.

236
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,677
Where's your lunch?

237
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,806
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

238
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,017
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

239
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,773
Thank you.

240
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,026
Let's go to a café.

241
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,695
Oh that one? OK. Coming, Taki?

242
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,490
What? What? What?

243
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,283
A café?

244
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,372
Nice timber work up there.

245
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,666
Yeah, attention to detail.

246
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,334
Taki, have you decided?

247
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,798
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

248
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,634
What decade are you from again?

249
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,555
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

250
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,896
What a great dream.

251
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,321
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

252
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,740
Your shift is today?

253
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,909
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,329
Oh! Um...

255
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,250
Where do I work?

256
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,835
What?

257
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,176
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

258
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,387
Table 12! Taki!

259
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,848
Here you go.

260
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,851
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

261
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,352
We didn't order that.

262
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,855
Taki, I said no more truffles!

263
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,857
Taki, I can't hear you!

264
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:20,858
Taki!

265
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,862
When is this dream going to end?

266
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,581
Hey. Hey waiter.

267
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,874
Oh, yes?

268
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,795
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

269
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,382
We could have gotten hurt.

270
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,970
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

271
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,139
Uh, we...

272
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,977
But... There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

273
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,064
Excuse me.

274
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,358
Is everything OK?

275
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,401
I'll handle this.

276
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,072
What's wrong with you today?

277
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,660
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

278
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,786
Oh, really?

279
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,038
I hope you weren't hurt.

280
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,341
Um...

281
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
Okudera...

282
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,885
Ms. Okudera.

283
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,972
Ms. Okudera. Thank you.

284
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,515
A stroke of bad luck today.

285
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,641
No, uh...

286
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,184
Bet it was a setup.

287
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,813
Handled it according to the book, but...

288
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,358
Oh, Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

289
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,694
You OK?

290
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,696
- What happened?
- Slashed.

291
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,698
That jerk from earlier?

292
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,242
What now? Do you remember his face?

293
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,618
No.

294
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,453
Come with me.

295
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,372
Hey, Taki!

296
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,041
Take off your skirt.

297
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,502
Oh! I'll look the other way!

298
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,675
This won't take long.

299
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,139
Done!

300
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,893
Wow, Taki. It looks better than before!

301
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,190
Thank you for saving me today.

302
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,404
Actually, I was concerned about you.

303
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,657
You're not that strong,
but you're also quick-tempered.

304
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,410
I like you better today.

305
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,748
Never knew you had a feminine side.

306
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,917
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

307
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,012
What a realistic dream
if I do say so myself.

308
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,435
Oh, he keeps a diary.

309
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,941
He's so organized.

310
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,694
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

311
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,449
Oh! That's her!

312
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,831
A crush, maybe?

313
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:34,468
"Walked Ms. Okudera to the station
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

314
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,304
"Who are you?"

315
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,818
"Mitsuha"

316
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,835
What is this?

317
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,336
"Mitsuha"

318
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,842
What? What?

319
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on!

320
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,763
Let's go to the café again.

321
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,182
Sorry, I have to go to work.

322
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,184
Do you remember where to go?

323
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,107
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

324
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,694
Oh, never mind. See you.

325
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,489
He's acting normal today.

326
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,325
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

327
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,201
What?

328
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,039
Wha... What?

329
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,417
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

330
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,210
You walked home with her!

331
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,507
Did I really? With Ms. Okudera?

332
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,217
What happened afterwards?

333
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,721
I don't really remember.

334
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,306
Oh really, now?

335
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,892
Coming through.

336
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,728
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

337
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,981
Let's make today a good one.

338
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,233
Right, Taki?

339
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,330
"Mitsuha? Who are you?
What are you?"

340
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,833
You're not touching your boobs today.

341
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,336
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

342
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,132
Boobs?

343
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,344
Morning.

344
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,436
Why is everyone staring at me?

345
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,940
Well, you made quite a scene yesterday.

346
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:53,607
Huh?

347
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,040
"Still life drawing"

348
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,137
Did you see all the election posters?

349
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,531
Doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about who gets the kickbacks.

350
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,785
Shh! Someone's father depends on it.

351
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,121
They mean me, right?

352
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,915
Well, yeah.

353
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,292
Hey, Mitsuha!

354
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:26,974
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

355
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,686
Mitsuha?

356
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,445
Is this... could this be...

357
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,367
Could this be that we're really...

358
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,869
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

359
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,789
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

360
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
switching places?

361
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,079
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

362
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,333
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

363
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,544
<i>I switch with Mitsuha at random</i>

364
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,588
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

365
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,550
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

366
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:48,764
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

367
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,267
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

368
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So... </i>

369
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:01,109
<i>So... We laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

370
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,154
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

371
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,155
"Don't be late! No dialect!"

372
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,500
We also agreed to leave reports
in our phones...

373
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,457
<i>...to work together to get through
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

374
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,417
But...

375
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,960
But...

376
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,713
- That girl!
- That guy!

377
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,899
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

378
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,904
<i>Stop wasting my money!</i>

379
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,824
<i>It's YOUR body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

380
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,000
Braided cords... I can't do this!

381
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,953
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

382
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,621
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

383
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>Grabbed coffee with Ms. Okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

384
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,858
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

385
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,361
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

386
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,406
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

387
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,367
<i>Don't be so full of yourself!
Not like YOU have a girlfriend!</i>

388
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

389
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,537
"Fool/Idiot"

390
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,581
I'm single because I want to be!

391
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,313
I shouldn't for her sake.

392
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,652
You sure do like your boobs.

393
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,155
We're going now! Get ready!

394
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,370
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
for a few days now.</i>

395
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,164
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

396
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:25,170
"Comet Tiamat to Reach its Perigee"

397
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,714
<i>So it can be seen above Venus...</i>

398
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
Why the uniform?

399
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:42,646
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away?

400
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,274
I don't know, because of Mayugoro.

401
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,734
Who's that?

402
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,194
What? He's famous!

403
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,746
Here, Grandma.

404
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,711
Whoa, Mitsuha.

405
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,726
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?

406
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,270
Musubi?

407
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:28,525
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

408
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,736
This word has profound meaning.

409
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:37,701
Tying thread is Musubi.
Connecting people is Musubi.

410
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,245
The flow of time is Musubi.

411
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,623
These are all the god's power.

412
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,377
So the braided cords that we make

413
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:52,924
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

414
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,261
They converge and take shape.

415
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,513
They twist, tangle

416
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:03,143
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

417
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,772
Musubi - knotting. That's time.

418
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,319
Drink.

419
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,778
Thank you.

420
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,905
I want some too!

421
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,283
That's also Musubi.

422
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,329
Whether it be water, rice, or sake

423
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:27,792
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

424
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,462
So today's offering

425
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:36,301
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

426
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,846
Hey, I see it!

427
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,187
That's the body
of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

428
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,582
Beyond this point is "Kakuriyo".

429
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,543
It means the underworld.

430
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,046
It's the underworld!

431
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,845
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

432
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,223
what is most important to you.

433
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,102
The Kuchikamisake.

434
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,604
The Kuchikamisake?

435
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,608
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

436
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,404
It's half of you.

437
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,324
<i>Half of Mitsuha...</i>

438
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,302
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.

439
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,388
Kataware-doki?

440
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,816
Oh yeah

441
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,776
maybe I can see the comet.

442
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,779
The comet?

443
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,406
Oh.

444
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,408
Mitsuha...

445
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,911
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

446
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,800
Tears? Why?

447
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,430
"I'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

448
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,434
Ms. Okudera? What's she talking about?

449
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,645
What did Mitsuha do this time?

450
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,440
A date?

451
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,992
<i>A date with Ms. Okudera tomorrow!</i>

452
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,453
<i>Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!</i>

453
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,458
...was what I'd planned, but...

454
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,473
Taki.

455
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,559
Sorry. Did you wait long?

456
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,228
Yes. No...

457
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,438
Um...

458
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,198
I just got here.

459
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,492
Good. Let's go.

460
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:53,081
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

461
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,961
Hey?

462
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
I...

463
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,718
Why?

464
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,519
<i>I wanted to go on this date</i>

465
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:20,024
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

466
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:29,033
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before</i>

467
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,079
I don't know what to say...

468
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>so here are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

469
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,918
Really?

470
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,295
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

471
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,800
"I suffer anxiety but I got a girl!"
"The dos and don'ts of texting"

472
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,303
She's making fun of me.

473
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,307
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

474
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,333
Taki...

475
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,795
You're like a different person today.

476
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,352
Um, Ms. Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

477
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,813
Let's call it a day.

478
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,650
Yes.

479
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,320
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

480
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,367
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

481
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,871
But now you like someone else.

482
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,500
No, I don't!

483
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,417
Really?

484
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,878
No! That's not true at all.

485
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,964
I wonder.

486
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

487
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:30,655
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

488
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,369
What is she saying?

489
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:43,167
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

490
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,191
Oh, hi Tessie.

491
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:13,740
No, I just didn't feel like going.
I'm fine.

492
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:18,119
What? The festival? Well...

493
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:24,167
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

494
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,712
OK, got it. Later, then.

495
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,092
You just want to see her in a Kimono.

496
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,178
What? No!

497
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,305
That didn't even occur to me.

498
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,434
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

499
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,561
Maybe you annoyed her.

500
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,771
Shut up!

501
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,813
Sorry I'm late.

502
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,356
- Here she is!
- Finally!

503
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,779
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

504
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,073
Your hair!

505
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,910
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

506
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,963
You think some guy is the reason?
Dumped, maybe?

507
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,925
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

508
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,427
She said she just felt like it.

509
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,972
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

510
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

511
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,538
Wow!

512
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:07,103
<i>The number you are trying to reach
is not available...</i>

513
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:15,361
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch.</i>

514
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,239
<i>So I thought. But...</i>

515
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,117
<i>For some reason, after that</i>

516
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:25,997
<i>Mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

517
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,035
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

518
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,464
"Hida Mountains"

519
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:23,572
What the... What are you doing here?

520
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,953
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

521
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:38,087
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

522
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,463
Takagi will cover your shift.

523
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,717
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

524
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,844
This isn't funny.

525
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,263
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

526
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,516
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

527
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,767
A con act?

528
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,061
You're meeting an online friend.

529
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,522
Well no, not exactly...

530
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,858
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

531
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,446
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

532
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,239
I'm not a kid!

533
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:12,079
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

534
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,751
<i>So I decided to go see Mitsuha
in person.</i>

535
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,004
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

536
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,553
What? You don't know where she lives?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

537
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,512
Yes.

538
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,894
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

539
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,730
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

540
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,065
I did not plan a tour!

541
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,526
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

542
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,696
Oh how cute! Look!

543
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:46,864
So annoying.

544
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,033
Oh, it moved!

545
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,188
So it's impossible after all...

546
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,067
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

547
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,239
You haven't done anything.

548
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,035
A Takayama ramen.

549
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,578
A Takayama ramen.

550
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,414
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

551
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,625
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

552
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,171
Can we return to Tokyo today?

553
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,466
We might be cutting it close.
Let me check.

554
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,342
Thanks.

555
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,803
Are you all right with that?

556
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,685
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

557
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,443
Why young man,
that's ltomori, isn't it?

558
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,989
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

559
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,161
Yeah, it's ltomori.
Brings back memories.

560
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,496
He was born in ltomori.

561
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,081
ltomori...?

562
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:25,588
Yes! ltomori! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

563
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,507
- What are you...
- ltomori was...

564
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,510
ltomori? No way!

565
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,305
Is that where that comet...?

566
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,274
"Keep Out"

567
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,899
Hey. Is this really the place?

568
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,903
No way. Taki must be misremembering.

569
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,698
No. I'm sure this is it.

570
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:40,412
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

571
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,331
That can't be true!

572
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:47,711
Surely you remember that disaster?
Hundreds of people died 3 years ago.

573
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,838
Died?

574
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,343
Died 3 years ago?

575
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,596
That can't be.

576
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,184
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

577
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,203
They're disappearing...

578
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,757
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1200 years.

579
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,724
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town". Nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

580
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,977
"Town Annihilated"

581
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,729
"Over 500 dead or missing"

582
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,230
"ltomori, The Town That Vanished"

583
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,235
A fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Itomori.

584
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,438
"ltomori, comet, damage"

585
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,200
It was the day of the Autumn Festival.

586
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,869
The point of impact was here.

587
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:08,250
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

588
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,077
"List of the Names of Victims"

589
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,450
Over 500 people died.
A third of the town's population.

590
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,511
Now nobody lives in ltomori anymore.

591
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,273
Tessie and Sayaka...

592
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,279
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

593
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:42,618
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

594
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:48,916
Just 3 weeks ago, she told me
that the comet would be visible.

595
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,042
So...

596
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,835
<i>You're dreaming now...<i>

597
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,295
I...

598
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,297
<i>...aren't you?</i>

599
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,383
I...

600
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,719
What did l...?

601
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,735
Lively up there.

602
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,446
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

603
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,823
No problem.

604
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,033
How's Taki?

605
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,453
He's still reading articles on ltomori.

606
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,832
Newspapers and magazines
from the time.

607
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,257
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

608
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,052
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

609
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,264
What do you think about Taki's story?

610
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,936
I liked him.

611
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:57,401
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

612
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,739
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

613
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:06,869
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

614
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,793
But I'm sure he met someone,
and that someone changed him.

615
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,465
That much is for sure, I think.

616
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,897
It was all just a dream.

617
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:42,571
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

618
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,658
If not that, then... a ghost?

619
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,914
No... Was I hallucinating?

620
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,254
Her name... What was it?

621
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,426
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

622
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,430
Oh, Ms. Okudera. I, uh...

623
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:14,436
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

624
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,942
No problem.

625
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,652
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

626
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,446
"Braided Cords of ltomori"

627
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,868
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

628
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,958
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

629
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,254
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

630
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,966
Who was it?

631
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:49,221
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

632
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,265
Yes. ...no.

633
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,730
Someone who made braided cords
told me before...

634
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,942
The cords represent
the flow of time.

635
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:08,073
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, then connect again. That's time...

636
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,286
Maybe at that place...

637
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,138
"Around here?"

638
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,021
<i>Taki.</i>

639
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,148
<i>Taki.</i>

640
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,275
<i>Taki.</i>

641
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,445
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

642
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:05,797
"I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo
without me. I'll be back later. Thanks."

643
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,552
Taki...

644
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,328
Eat this up there.

645
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,333
Your drawing of ltomori... It was good.

646
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:23,709
<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle</i>

647
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,379
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

648
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

649
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,646
There it is!

650
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,316
It's really there!

651
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,320
It wasn't just a dream!

652
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,854
From here is the underworld.

653
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,838
It's the sake we brought.

654
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,468
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

655
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:05,894
This was before the comet... So the
Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

656
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,899
Our timelines weren't in sync.

657
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,112
Half of her...

658
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,836
Musubi.

659
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,048
If time can really be turned back

660
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,301
give me one last chance...

661
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,733
The comet!

662
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,093
Your name is Mitsuha.

663
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,727
You're both my treasures.

664
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,271
You're a big sister now.

665
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,857
"Get well soon, Mom"

666
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,526
I'm so sorry, my dears.

667
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:23,657
Dad, when is Mom going to come home?

668
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,992
I couldn't save her.

669
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,036
Get a hold of yourself!

670
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,412
Who cares about the shrine?

671
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,206
You're the adopted son-in-law!

672
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,417
I loved my wife.
Not the Miyamizu Shrine.

673
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,002
Get out of here!

674
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,966
Mitsuha, Yotsuha

675
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,636
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

676
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,350
"Who are you?"

677
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,727
"Fool"

678
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,984
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

679
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,444
I...

680
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,821
I'm going to Tokyo.

681
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,030
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

682
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,662
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

683
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,124
Oh yeah, the comet.

684
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,836
Today's the peak of its brightness...

685
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,963
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

686
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:25,510
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

687
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,015
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there!</i>

688
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,143
<i>Mitsuha! Mitsuha!</i>

689
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,353
<i>Mitsuha!</i>

690
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,666
I'm Mitsuha. She's still alive!

691
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,429
Mitsuha, are you touching...

692
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,100
My sister!

693
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,355
Yotsuha!

694
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,777
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

695
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,446
I'm leaving without her.

696
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,032
She's lost it. She's lost it.

697
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,701
She's completely lost it.

698
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,161
Scary.

699
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,665
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

700
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,628
<i>Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,</i>

701
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,381
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

702
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,384
It's tonight. There's still time.

703
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,761
Good morning, Mitsuha.

704
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,596
Oh...

705
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,308
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

706
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,604
You knew, Grandma?

707
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:06,152
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

708
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:12,659
I also remember strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

709
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:19,707
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

710
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,584
Forgotten...

711
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:26,673
Treasure the experience.
Dreams eventually fade away.

712
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:31,678
There were times your mother and I
had similar experiences.

713
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,391
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had...

714
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,145
they were all about today.

715
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,689
Grandma, listen.

716
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:48,069
A comet will strike ltomori tonight
and everyone will die.

717
01:05:55,326 --> 01:06:00,665
<i>"Nobody will believe that"
What a surprisingly ordinary reply, Grandma.</i>

718
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,501
I won't let them die!

719
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,172
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

720
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:11,593
Your... your hair!

721
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,262
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

722
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,847
Oh, that's it?

723
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,143
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

724
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,564
So we have to act!

725
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,070
Why aren't you at school?

726
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:35,909
Uh... We have to save the town.

727
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,703
The community wireless system?

728
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,331
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

729
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,893
"Superimposition, frequency, hijacking"

730
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,881
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

731
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,509
Hey! Don't come so close!

732
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,719
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

733
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,889
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

734
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,050
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

735
01:07:00,074 --> 01:07:02,074
Aw, you're such a nice guy!

736
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,399
Got them. Here's your change.

737
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,817
Sorry, Sayaka.

738
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,319
It's all right.

739
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,863
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

740
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:19,827
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

741
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,542
Bomb? Bomb? A BOMB?

742
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,213
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

743
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,714
Broadcast hijacking?

744
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:37,053
The town's wireless system can be easily
hacked using the startup frequency.

745
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,640
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

746
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:45,937
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can gather here.

747
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,232
It's... It's totally a crime!

748
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,900
You do the broadcast.

749
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,611
- Why?
- You're in the Broadcasting Club.

750
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,405
I'm in charge of explosives.

751
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,615
I'll go talk to the Mayor.

752
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,995
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

753
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

754
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,417
It's a perfect plan.

755
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:13,172
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it?

756
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,633
What? Well...

757
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,679
Not necessarily! Do you know
how Lake ltomori was formed?

758
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:25,683
A meteor hit there 1000 years ago.
And it created that lake.

759
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,437
Oh! So that's why...

760
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,814
You're right, Tessie!

761
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,445
Let's do it together!

762
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,951
What on earth are you talking about?

763
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,665
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

764
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,958
Shut your mouth.

765
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,967
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

766
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,970
"ltomori Town Hall"

767
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,973
How dare you spout such nonsense?

768
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,560
If you're serious, then you're sick.

769
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,980
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

770
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,611
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

771
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,823
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

772
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,578
You son of a...!

773
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,924
Mitsuha! No...

774
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,051
Who...

775
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,179
Who are you?

776
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,404
See you later at the festival.

777
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,280
Let's meet at the shrine.

778
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,448
- Don't be late.
- Bye bye!

779
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,117
- See you.
- Later.

780
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,120
You shouldn't go!

781
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,123
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

782
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,499
What are you saying?

783
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,625
Mitsuha!

784
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,086
- What was that?
- Let's go.

785
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,588
What are you doing?

786
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,882
Could Mitsuha...

787
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,636
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

788
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,890
Yotsuha, leave town with Grandma
before nightfall.

789
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,934
You'll die if you stay here!

790
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,978
What are you saying?

791
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:36,524
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

792
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,610
Tokyo?

793
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,572
Hey, Mitsuha!

794
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,909
How did it go with your old man?

795
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,705
Hey, Mitsuha?

796
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,540
What's wrong with her?

797
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,791
No idea.

798
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,511
Are you there?

799
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,931
Is something over there?

800
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,600
Tessie, let me use your bike.

801
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:11,726
Hey, what the...

802
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,060
Hey, Mitsuha!

803
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:15,646
What do we do now?

804
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,648
Get ready as planned!

805
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,692
Please!

806
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,179
I'm Taki again.

807
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,519
What's Taki doing here?

808
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,320
The town...

809
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,656
is gone.

810
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:19,877
At that moment... did I...

811
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,841
die?

812
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,228
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

813
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,732
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

814
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,330
I'm going to Tokyo.

815
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,748
What? Now?

816
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,250
Why?

817
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,751
A date.

818
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,087
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

819
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,131
Not my date.

820
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,426
I'll come home tonight.

821
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:16,267
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

822
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,978
<i>He might not like it.</i>

823
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,823
<i>The number you are trying to reach
is not available...</i>

824
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,909
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

825
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,286
<i>But what if we did?</i>

826
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,291
<i>What would I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

827
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,294
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"
Or maybe...

828
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,214
<i>Maybe he'd be glad to see me?</i>

829
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:52,303
<i>The number you are trying to reach
is not available...</i>

830
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,222
<i>I guess we won't meet.</i>

831
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,892
But...

832
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,812
<i>...one thing is certain.</i>

833
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,651
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

834
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,738
<i>That you were the one who was in me.</i>

835
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,659
<i>And that I was the one who was in you.</i>

836
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,494
I'm sorry.

837
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,859
Excuse me.

838
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:25,396
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I knew you...</i>

839
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,401
Taki.

840
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,903
Taki.

841
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:35,990
Taki.

842
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,160
Um... It's me.

843
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,748
Don't you remember me?

844
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,417
Who are you?

845
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,590
I'm sorry.

846
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,932
<i>But he's Taki.</i>

847
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,935
<i>Strange girl.</i>

848
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:14,820
Hey!

849
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,323
What's your name?

850
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:18,991
Mitsuha!

851
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,952
My name is Mitsuha!

852
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:34,215
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

853
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,425
<i>to see me!</i>

854
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,646
Taki?

855
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,073
Mitsuha!

856
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,617
Taki?

857
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,800
Mitsuha!

858
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,804
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

859
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,973
Taki!

860
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,475
Taki, where are you?

861
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,519
It's Mitsuha.

862
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,771
I can hear her, but...

863
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,859
Taki, where are you?

864
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:35,943
Taki!

865
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,375
Taki, are you...

866
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,170
There?

867
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,863
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

868
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,879
Mitsuha.

869
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,553
Taki.

870
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,350
Taki. It's really you.

871
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,605
Taki!

872
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,899
I came to see you.

873
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:01,237
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

874
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:06,116
But how? At that moment, I...<i>

875
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,661
I drank your Kuchikamisake.

876
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,625
You drank that?

877
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,127
You idiot! Pervert!

878
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,215
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

879
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,300
How do you know that?

880
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,052
My sister saw it.

881
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,889
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

882
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,432
Just once?

883
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,395
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

884
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,438
Sorry.

885
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,941
Oh, this...

886
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:43,445
Oh. Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

887
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,781
There was no way I'd recognize you.

888
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:49,326
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

889
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,912
Now you keep it.

890
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,957
Yes.

891
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,174
How is it?

892
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,468
Not bad.

893
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,012
You're lying!

894
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,472
No, I... Sorry.

895
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,017
You're really so...!

896
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,491
Mitsuha, you still have
things to do. Listen.

897
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:33,579
It's coming.

898
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,623
Don't worry. You've still got time.

899
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,584
Yes, I'll try.

900
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,047
Kataware-doki is almost...

901
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,673
over.

902
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,554
Hey, Mitsuha. So we don't forget
when we wake up...

903
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,687
Let's write our names
on each other. Here.

904
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,231
OK!

905
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:11,909
Mitsuha?

906
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,038
Hey, Mitsuha?

907
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,840
I wanted to tell you.

908
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,639
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll search for you.

909
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,561
Your name is Mitsuha.

910
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,315
It's OK. I remember.

911
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,611
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.
Your name is Mitsuha.

912
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,238
Your name is...

913
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,626
Who are you?

914
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,714
Why did I come here?

915
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,760
I came here to see her.

916
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,597
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

917
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,018
Who was it? Who?
Who did I come to see?

918
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:25,399
Someone dear to me. I don't want
to forget. I don't want to forget!

919
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:31,530
Who? Who? Who? Who?

920
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,615
What's your name?

921
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,675
<i>Taki. Taki. Taki.</i>

922
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:55,512
<i>It's OK. I remember. I'll never forget!</i>

923
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,307
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

924
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:01,643
<i>Your name is Taki!</i>

925
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,363
"ltomori Substation"

926
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,618
Tessie!

927
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,370
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

928
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,372
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

929
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,000
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

930
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,338
Explain it to me later.

931
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,011
That's going to fall? Really?

932
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,180
Yes! I saw it with my own eyes!

933
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,974
What? You saw it?

934
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:46,188
Then I guess we got no choice.
Now we're both criminals!

935
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,050
What? I really have to do it?

936
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:57,407
When the town's power goes out, the
equipment should work on backup.

937
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,827
Please, Sayaka!
Repeat it as much as you can!

938
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,497
You can do it!

939
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:07,042
Oh, to heck with it!

940
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,218
- Soon, you think?
- I have no idea!

941
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,146
- What was that?
- What's that sound?

942
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:29,606
Hey, look!

943
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,217
Hey, look!

944
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:10,272
<i>This is ltomori Town Hall.</i>

945
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:14,484
<i>An explosion has occurred
at the substation.</i>

946
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,780
<i>There is danger of further explosions
and forest fires.</i>

947
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:25,287
<i>Residents in the following areas, please
evacuate to ltomori High School.</i>

948
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:30,334
<i>Kadoiri District, Sakagami District</i>

949
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:34,296
The broadcast isn't from here?
Who is it, then?

950
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,881
<i>Miyamori District...</i>

951
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:38,800
<i>Oyazawa District...</i>

952
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,303
Let's go, Mitsuha!

953
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,264
Tessie!

954
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,398
Run, everyone! Forest fire!

955
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,859
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

956
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:57,694
Run! Fire!

957
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,822
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

958
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,326
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

959
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,663
What's wrong?

960
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:12,167
His name... I can't remember his name.

961
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:18,215
Look, I have no idea.
You started all this!

962
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:22,052
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!

963
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,763
Go persuade your father!

964
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,316
Everyone run! Go to the high school!

965
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,195
Oh, Mitsuha.

966
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,952
It's not a terrorist attack!
What's the electric company saying?

967
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,578
They're still checking!

968
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:52,082
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

969
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,208
OK!

970
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:58,422
Stop this broadcast!
Figure out where it's coming from!

971
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:01,216
The Takayama Sensor Station called!

972
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,719
The high school?

973
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:10,100
<i>Again, residents in the following areas,
evacuate to ltomori High School. ...Oh!</i>

974
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,602
<i>What are you doing? Turn that off!</i>

975
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,731
Sayaka!

976
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,607
Oh no.

977
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:23,613
What have you done, Sayaka!

978
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,703
<i>This is ltomori Town Hall.</i>

979
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:34,624
<i>We are currently
checking on the accident.</i>

980
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:40,130
<i>Please don't panic and stay
where you are until further notice.</i>

981
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,339
Stay put, they said.

982
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:44,301
- What's going on?
- So we stay put?

983
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:50,432
Come on, you should all evacuate!
The high school is the shelter!

984
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,933
Katsuhiko!

985
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,897
What are you doing?

986
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,110
Sorry, Mitsuha.

987
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,821
It's over.

988
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:10,827
It's really splitting apart!

989
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,002
- Look at that!
- Wow!

990
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,838
<i>Please look! The comet has split in two.</i>

991
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,757
<i>And meteors are falling!</i>

992
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,593
<i>Nobody predicted this.</i>

993
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,345
<i>We have a magical view here.</i>

994
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,430
<i>So the comet's nucleus split?</i>

995
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,848
<i>Did tidal forces affect...</i>

996
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:36,853
<i>The comet isn't within the Roche limit
so the nucleus itself must have...</i>

997
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:42,234
<i>In the past, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.</i>

998
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:43,610
<i>At least 21 fragments...</i>

999
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,862
I'm going to go look!

1000
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,866
<i>They will probably melt
before reaching the ground</i>

1001
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,371
<i>and the probability of a meteor hitting
a residential area is small...</i>

1002
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,122
<i>To predict the trajectory...</i>

1003
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,584
<i>We stand here, witnessing a magnificent
celestial event.</i>

1004
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:02,462
<i>We're witnessing this live.</i>

1005
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:07,175
<i>We're extremely fortunate
to be living in this age.</i>

1006
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,472
<i>Hey. Who are you?</i>

1007
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,478
<i>Who? Who?</i>

1008
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,897
<i>Who are you?</i>

1009
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:25,652
<i>Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.
I didn't want to forget!</i>

1010
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,824
<i>Who? Who? Who are you?</i>

1011
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,910
<i>What's your name?</i>

1012
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,002
It's broken!

1013
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:06,484
<i>So we don't forget when we wake up,
let's write our names on each other.</i>

1014
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:18,455
"I love you"

1015
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:38,016
I can't remember your name...

1016
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:52,906
Dad!

1017
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,201
- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

1018
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,745
Not you again...

1019
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:06,419
<i>It was almost as if it were
a scene from a dream.</i>

1020
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,799
<i>Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.</i>

1021
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:48,104
What am I doing here?

1022
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,473
<i>I'm always searching for something.</i>

1023
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:28,103
<i>This feeling has possessed me
for some time.</i>

1024
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,065
I applied because...

1025
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,566
The landscapes people live in...

1026
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,568
To build a city's landscape...

1027
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,864
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

1028
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:46,079
So I want to help build landscapes that
leave heartwarming memories...

1029
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,375
How many interviews have you had?

1030
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,584
I haven't kept track.

1031
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:54,045
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot.

1032
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,588
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1033
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,590
We're not that different!

1034
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,843
- I have 2 job offers.
- I have 8.

1035
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,723
"LINE: You have a new message."

1036
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:10,603
<i>I'm not sure if I'm
searching for a person or a place</i>

1037
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:16,609
<i>or if I'm just searching for a job.</i>

1038
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,280
Oh, you're job-hunting.

1039
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:22,448
I haven't had much luck.

1040
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,410
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1041
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:27,453
Does it look that bad?

1042
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,377
What brings you here today?

1043
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:39,382
I was nearby for work
so I figured I'd say hi to you.

1044
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:42,049
"8 years since the comet disaster"

1045
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:45,960
We went to Itomori once, didn't we?

1046
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:49,475
You were still in high school, so it was...

1047
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,353
- 5 years ago.
- That long?

1048
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,815
Seems like I've forgotten a lot.

1049
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:01,404
<i>I also don't remember much
from back then.</i>

1050
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:07,410
<i>Maybe we had an argument. The other two
returned to Tokyo without me.</i>

1051
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,706
<i>I spent the night alone
on some mountain.</i>

1052
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,416
<i>That's about all I remember.</i>

1053
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:19,505
<i>But at one point,
I was inexplicably drawn</i>

1054
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:22,842
<i>to the events surrounding that comet.</i>

1055
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:28,681
<i>Half of a comet destroyed a town
in that disaster.</i>

1056
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:33,228
But most of the town's residents
were miraculously unhurt.

1057
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:38,190
<i>The entire town happened to be
holding an emergency drill.</i>

1058
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:42,010
and most of its residents were
outside the blast zone.

1059
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,336
The sheer luck and coincidence
of it all sparked various rumors.

1060
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:52,200
I read a lot of articles about
it back then. I was pretty obsessed.

1061
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:59,462
<i>What had caught my interest
so much is now a mystery to me.</i>

1062
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,300
<i>I didn't even know anybody in that town.</i>

1063
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:08,888
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1064
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:15,478
You'll be happy someday too.

1065
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:24,612
<i>I feel like I'm always searching
