15
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,072
[Misty] I’m not letting you
out of my sight, Ash Ketchum,

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,657
until you pay for my broken bike.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,035
"My bike! My bike!"
That’s all I ever hear from you.

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,413
Right! And my name may be Misty,

19
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,456
but I’m perfectly clear
about what you owe me

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,292
and you’re not going to get away
without paying.

21
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,752
Maybe if you two had spent
less time arguing

22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,796
and paid more attention
to where we’re going,

23
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,132
we’d already be in Vermilion City by now.

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,093
Come on, we’re already late.
We’ve got to start the show.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,261
Chu.

26
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,853
I think we all need a little break.

27
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,439
Why don’t I just throw
a little something together?

28
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:51,111
Ah! There’s nothing as satisfying
as a cup of 100% Cerulean coffee.

29
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,072
You kids are too young for this stuff
but it’s really quite good.

30
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,908
-[Brock] How about some prune juice?
-I think I’ll pass.

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,871
-How about some herbal tea?
-You must be kidding.

32
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,334
Not so fast, Ash.
I brought my official Pokémon tea set.

33
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,712
Now, of course, the key to good tea
and coffee is good water,

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,673
and I just happen to have
a generous supply of sparkling,

35
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,344
delicious Mt. Moon pure spring water.

36
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,348
[Brock] And for the special snack,
I have for you some French crepes.

37
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:24,144
[gasps] I love French things.
They’re so romantic, aren’t they?

38
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,612
All that crunching and slurping
is ruining my romantic daydreams.

39
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,655
-[Brock] Ah, by the way.
-[both] Huh?

40
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,784
I can’t cook crepes and I can’t boil water
if I don’t have a fire!

41
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,622
One of you is going to have to go into
the forest and carry back some firewood.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,248
That’s a very excellent idea, Brock,

43
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,377
and I’m willing to sacrifice the
excitement of searching for firewood

44
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,504
to stay here and keep you company.

45
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,717
-Well, I guess that means that...
-Yeah, I’m going. Uh!

46
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,305
[Ash] Here, firewood.
Here, firewood.

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,184
No firewood here, Pikachu.
Why do I have to do all the dirty--?

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,186
-Pika pi. Pikachu.
-Hmm?

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,730
Hey, looks like a fire.

50
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,650
[man] All right, what’s the name
of this one?

51
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,361
Is it a Zubat?

52
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,613
Listen, just because it’s foggy out here

53
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,323
doesn’t mean your brain
has to be in a fog.

54
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,537
-It’s a Pidgey.
-Nice guess. You just got lucky.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,498
Okay, now tell us
what its special attack is.

56
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209
Pidgey’s attack is Gust.

57
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,212
At level 5, Sand Attack. At level 12--

58
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:37,092
Everybody knows that. Now can you just
tell me at which level Pidgey evolves

59
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,177
and what’s the name
of Pidgey’s advanced stage?

60
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,138
Um...

61
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,182
You better come up with answers quick
or you’ll have to run faster.

62
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,143
[grunting]

63
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,901
[groans]

64
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,405
-I’m sorry. I forgot.
-[all sigh]

65
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,535
You forgot. Huh, and you call yourself
a Pokémon Tech student.

66
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,495
Well, we don’t want to study
with the likes of you.

67
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,830
I’m sorry.

68
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,916
Hey, leave that kid alone.
What’s going on here?

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,878
There’s nothing going on here.
Mind your own business.

70
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,046
This is a private training session.

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,841
There’s no room
in our Pokémon school for losers

72
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,843
who don’t even know
Pidgey’s evolved stage.

73
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,386
We have to maintain standards.

74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,346
I don’t know anything
about this school of yours,

75
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,182
but if it’s turning out students like you,

76
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,851
I’d have to say the standards
are pretty low.

77
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,812
[Misty] That’s right, Ash. You tell them.
-Misty?

78
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,773
You better stop bullying that kid

79
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,275
or you’ll have to answer to us, right,
Ash?

80
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,944
Misty, you stay out of this.
Leave it to me.

81
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,782
You’re right, Ash. There’s no reason
for both of us to get into a fight.

82
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,910
It’s very brave of you to take
on all five by yourself.

83
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,994
[nervous chuckle]

84
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,497
[Misty] I’ll be here on the sidelines,
cheering you on,

85
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,333
waiting to drag
your carcass away at the end.

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,503
-[Misty] Show them you’re a man, Ash.
-We don’t fight.

87
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,048
Fighting is for cavemen.
This isn’t the Stone Age, you know.

88
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,802
And if we wasted our time having
a fight with a little insect like you,

89
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,012
it’d just make Pokémon Tech
look really bad.

90
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,349
-We’ll see you back at the Tech, Joe.
-Okay.

91
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,685
Hey, maybe you cowards are just
afraid to fight someone like me.

92
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,145
The only thing we’re afraid of is

93
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,774
how badly we’d beat
a little punk like you. [chuckles]

94
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,818
Who do those guys think they are?

95
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,031
-So those are the infamous Tech students.
-Tech students?

96
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,535
Pokémon Tech.
I think it’s short for Pokémon Technical,

97
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,370
a school for Pokémon trainers.

98
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,415
I know I had a flier here somewhere.
Yeah, here it is.

99
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,793
A Pokémon school in the middle of nowhere?

100
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,463
Hm, let’s see what it says here
about the place.

101
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,966
"Pokémon Technical Institute.

102
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,678
A boarding school for serious
Pokémon trainer preparation.

103
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,015
All students guaranteed to enter
Pokémon league upon graduation.

104
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,018
Pokémon Technical
is the educational facility

105
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,522
for exceptional students who want
to become Pokémon trainers

106
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,731
in a very short time

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,194
without having to travel on
difficult badge-collecting journeys."

108
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,154
[groans]

109
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,115
Oh, so that’s the story.

110
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,201
Getting into the Pokémon League
without badges is too easy.

111
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,411
Wait, there’s more.

112
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,373
"Students entrance fees and tuition
are in keeping with the highest standards

113
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,250
set by Pokémon Technical."

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,294
You know what that means, don’t you?

115
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,214
It’s one of those snobby private schools
only millionaires’ kids can go to.

116
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,718
Oh, that really makes me mad.

117
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,845
Where is this place, anyway?

118
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,430
-It’s right over there.
-Huh?

119
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,350
[woman on speakers] Today’s special class,
fog battle techniques, is now ended.

120
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,146
Tomorrow’s lesson
will be snow competition secrets.

121
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,023
[sighs]

122
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,568
Oh, well. I guess tomorrow
they’ll make me into a snowman again.

123
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,987
Do they treat you like that all the time?

124
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,990
-My friends are just trying to help me.
-You call them friends?

125
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,701
With friends like that,
who needs enemies?

126
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:55,248
But they helped me learn that Pidgey
evolves to Pidgeotto at level 18,

127
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,628
it learns Whirlwind at level 21,
Wing Attack at level 31,

128
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,797
and that as its level rises,
it learns various tricks.

129
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:08,928
After evolving to Pidgeot, it can fly at
1200 meters and speeds of up to Mach 2.

130
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,640
I don’t get it.
If you know everything about Pidgey,

131
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,017
why didn’t you just answer them before?

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,145
Sometimes, I make believe
that I don’t know all the answers,

133
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,273
because if I do, they make
the questions that much harder.

134
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,817
But I have to stay here at Pokémon Tech.

135
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,278
My mother and father worked hard
and saved money,

136
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,697
so they could pay to send me
to school here.

137
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,867
You see that guy over there?
He’s an upperclassman.

138
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:35,664
The classes are so hard here, some
students are held back for many years.

139
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,501
Everybody’s too ashamed to go home
without getting a diploma.

140
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,671
That guy,
he’s in the beginners’ class with me.

141
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,797
You’re a beginner?

142
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,342
Beginners have the same qualifications
as someone with two badges,

143
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,845
the intermediate class
has the qualifications of four,

144
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,306
and advanced students
have the same as six.

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,101
If you graduate,
you can enter the Pokémon League

146
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,520
without traveling around
to collect the badges.

147
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,063
That guy’s a beginner,

148
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,357
but he’s so much older
than everybody in the class,

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,985
the kids don’t bother to help him
like they help me.

150
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,612
What do the teachers say
about that kind of help?

151
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,449
They don’t even know about it
or if they do, they pretend not to.

152
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,536
Well, I for one think
this is a violation of students’ rights

153
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,831
that must stop immediately,
if not sooner.

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,918
I want to meet the student in charge
of this system and I’ll see that it stops.

155
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,421
-Mm, here’s a picture.
-[all gasp]

156
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,216
-[Misty] It’s a girl?
-Oh, yeah, you’re right about that.

157
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,093
She can violate my rights if--

158
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,804
Hey!
If she’s making your life so miserable,

159
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,556
how come you’re carrying
her picture around?

160
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,434
I hate the way she treats us
but I like the way she looks.

161
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,730
Yeah, not like some other girls who treat
you bad and look even worse.

162
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,274
While you two are slobbering over
that dopey picture,

163
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,943
I’m going to find this little witch
and straighten her out.

164
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,238
Miss top student.
What’s so great about her?

165
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,906
Hey, Misty, wait.

166
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,998
That place brings back memories,
James.

167
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,917
It certainly does, Jessie,
and all of them are awful.

168
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,545
Tell me your tale of failure again.

169
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,507
-We studied for the big test.
-So sure we would beat all the rest.

170
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,469
And here’s the part I like the best.

171
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,889
We frolicked that night,
for our future seemed bright.

172
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,058
But things weren’t right.

173
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,935
[both] We got the lowest scores
in the history of the school.

174
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,689
-You should look on the bright side.
-[both] What’s the bright side?

175
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,942
At least you guys
were the top of the bottom.

176
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,155
You’re the tops, Meowth.
Such a kind little Pokémon. Ooh, ooh.

177
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,618
These two are worse off than I thought.
I liked it better when they were nasty.

178
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,122
Giselle always practices here
by herself.

179
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,375
Even if you beat her in a fight,
it won’t matter to her.

180
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,420
At the Tech, it’s your skill
as a Pokémon trainer...

181
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,589
that counts more
than winning in any one battle.

182
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,468
That’s what I’m hoping
because I’ve got two badges.

183
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,971
But Giselle is the top beginner
here at the tech.

184
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,100
That’s better
than even having three badges.

185
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,435
Even though I’m at the bottom
of my class,

186
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,438
I’m still more powerful
than someone with two badges.

187
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,524
Argh! Hold on a second here.

188
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,777
I learned how to be a Pokémon trainer
at the Cerulean City Gym.

189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,195
Are you saying you can beat me?

190
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,115
Oh, Cerulean City. Water Pokémon.

191
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,869
-How’d you know?
-I always beat them on the simulator. See?

192
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,788
What is this?

193
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:26,000
A simulation’s one thing
but this is real life. Let’s battle.

194
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,710
You’ll be sorry.

195
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,713
[both grunt]

196
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,758
-[Ash] What do you two have to battle for?
-Butt out, Ash.

197
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,262
I have the Cerulean City Gym’s
reputation to defend

198
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,722
and I’m going to defend it.

199
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,852
Misty calls Starmie!

200
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,482
Too bad your water Pokémon
won’t be able to beat my plant.

201
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,819
All right, Weepinbell, let’s go.

202
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,280
Bell.

203
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,075
I’ll teach him about Pokémon.
Starmie, go!

204
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,290
-[groans]
-Huh?

205
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,210
Oh, but Weepinbell is strong
against water Pokémon.

206
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,213
True, but there’s one thing
you didn’t know.

207
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,550
Your opponent’s from
the Cerulean City Gym.

208
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,386
Her Pokémon has much
more experience battling.

209
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,096
You should’ve known that.

210
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,432
You’ve an embarrassment
to the whole school.

211
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,685
-But, Giselle--
-She’s really pretty, isn’t she?

212
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,148
-Yeah, just like a movie star.
-They like stars, do they?

213
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,817
I’ll be glad to show them some stars.

214
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,194
I’m the top student in the beginning class

215
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,324
of the most exclusive prep school
in the world, Pokémon Tech.

216
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,826
It’s sad that others aren’t blessed
with my beauty,

217
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,579
my talent, my humble attitude.

218
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,417
People call me a star
but I’m just Giselle.

219
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,046
I think she’s even more conceited
than we are.

220
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,717
-Yes, but she’s awfully cute, isn’t she?
-Not as cute as Meowth.

221
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,720
-[Jessie] Oh, you’re in the way.
-[James] Stop bothering us.

222
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,432
Meowth!

223
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,645
I want to continue to help my classmates
be the very best they can be.

224
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,524
To teach each other, respect each other,
and insure the Pokémon of tomorrow.

225
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,402
-But you’re a weakling.
-Uh.

226
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,072
You’d better get stronger fast
or before you know it,

227
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,659
your fellow students will turn
their backs on you for good.

228
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,410
Hmm.

229
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:33,544
Not so fast. A true friend wouldn’t walk
away from someone who needs their help.

230
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,297
You may look beautiful
but you remind me of an old saying

231
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,341
about how beauty’s only skin deep.

232
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,260
Heh, jealousy’s not very
pretty either, is it?

233
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,554
I better do something.

234
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,933
Wise Pokémon trainers
never get involved in a cat fight.

235
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,309
Huh?

236
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,854
Against your water Pokémon,
I’ll choose...

237
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,276
Graveler. Go!

238
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,157
Graveler? But rock Pokémon
are weak against water Pokémon.

239
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,203
But my Pokémon are at such an advanced
level, they can beat water Pokémon.

240
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,998
[grunting and groaning]

241
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,305
I can’t believe it.

242
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,308
Now we’re by the pool,
your Pokémon's specialty.

243
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,311
You can use a different water Pokémon
if you want.

244
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,274
Oh, and I’m sure you’ll choose another
Pokémon that’s weak against water.

245
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,068
Pokémon are only as strong
as the trainer who raises them.

246
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,572
A Pokémon that’s weaker
but better-trained can still win.

247
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,242
It depends on the trainer. I hope you’re
learning something from this, Joe.

248
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
A Pokémon's level of training
is just as important a factor

249
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,706
as a Pokémon's type in deciding a match.

250
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,668
A first-class Pokémon trainer
can calculate that.

251
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,589
Wait a minute. There’s more to Pokémon
training than calculating levels.

252
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,592
-Who are you?
-I’m Ash Ketchum from Pallet,

253
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,552
and I’ve already got two badges.

254
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,930
Heh, in other words, you’re a beginner.

255
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,017
And how long have you been trying
to become a Pokémon trainer?

256
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,479
Um, about two months, I guess.

257
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,691
[gasps] Two whole months
and you let your Pikachu walk free?

258
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,193
You haven’t even been able to tame it yet?

259
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,905
-Maybe your Pokémon are training you.
-Chu!

260
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,075
I don’t want to train Pikachu.
Pikachu’s my friend,

261
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,535
and so are Butterfree and Pidgeotto.

262
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,788
-Is that all you have?
-Huh?

263
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,499
That’s funny because even new
Pokémon trainers

264
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:39,212
usually have at least six Pokémon
and you got two badges with only three.

265
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,755
He sure was lucky, wasn’t he?

266
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,591
Every one of mine has the power of two.

267
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,345
I wonder, with two months
of Pokémon experience,

268
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,306
your Pikachu should be
at least at level 25,

269
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,600
but it’s probably not there yet, is it?

270
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,104
I suppose you didn’t know very much
about Pokémon

271
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,608
if you picked a Pikachu as your first
one. Pikachu tend to be hard to handle.

272
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,195
It says so in any beginning
Pokémon manual.

273
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,948
[gasps] You really didn’t know?

274
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,575
And you still got two badges? How funny.

275
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,121
A Pikachu evolves into an
electric Pokémon called Raichu.

276
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,623
It gets to be about 2 feet 7 inches tall.

277
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,085
Pikachu can shock you, but otherwise,
it’s pretty cute, don’t you think?

278
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,587
So if you don’t let them evolve,
they make great pets,

279
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,216
especially for little girls
but I’m sure you knew that, didn’t you?

280
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,718
Really? You didn’t?
And you have two badges?

281
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,680
[chuckles]

282
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
-Knock it off!
-Pikachu.

283
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,016
Let’s battle.

284
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,562
For your Pikachu,
this should be more than a match.

285
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,149
Cubone, go!

286
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,196
Cubone, bone, bone, bone.
Cubone. Cubone.

287
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,117
This Pikachu is my friend
and it’s different from any other Pikachu.

288
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,371
-Shock Attack!
-Pow!

289
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,834
Cubone, bone, bone, bone,
bone, bone, bone. Cubone.

290
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,461
-What?
-Pika?

291
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,463
Pikachu can’t shock it.

292
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,798
Cubone, start things off
with your Leer Attack.

293
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:10,178
-Cu-bone!
-Pika. Chu.

294
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,142
Pikachu, stare it down. Like this.

295
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,312
[grunting and groaning]

296
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,815
Cubone, Cubone...

297
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,401
Cubone, Bone Club now!

298
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,070
Hey, that’s not fair.

299
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,199
I’m not playing around.
This isn’t a staring contest.

300
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,410
This is a contest of power
and skill between two Pokémon.

301
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,537
Cubone, it’s time for the Bonemerang now.

302
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,998
Cubone, Cubone.

303
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,295
Oh! Pikachu!

304
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,507
Throwing that bone is a cheap way to win.

305
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,467
Well, that’s Cubone’s special attack.

306
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,345
It’s authorized by the Pokémon League
and it’s perfectly legal.

307
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,847
-It’s still a cheap trick.
-[sighs]

308
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,184
-Pikachu?
-Cubone! Cubone!

309
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,561
[groans]

310
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,898
-Oh, Pikachu!
-Cubone.

311
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,901
Calling it a cheap trick
simply proves your own ignorance.

312
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,403
Ugh, hang in there, Pikachu.

313
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,657
If your opponent’s attack is authorized,
then fighting back is too.

314
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,244
Give it your best shot.
Come on, Pikachu.

315
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,037
Bonemerang, now!

316
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,373
[grunting and groaning]

317
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,336
-Huh?
-Go on, Pikachu.

318
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,005
-Give it everything you’ve got.
-Pika!

319
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,935
-Cubone!
-We did it!

320
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,228
[both cheering]

321
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,187
Cubone!

322
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,482
I lost. Cubone, good try.

323
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,069
-Come on back. Don’t cry.
-Cubone.

324
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,197
You’ll be okay now.

325
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,117
None of the textbooks
ever mention a Pikachu winning

326
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,994
by anything other than electricity.

327
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,454
That was a once-in-a-lifetime battle.

328
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,916
And don’t try to copy it.
It was just kind of a fluke.

329
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,377
It was a cool fluke, wasn’t it?

330
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,550
There’s another way to win that’s not
in the textbooks too, isn’t there, James?

331
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,804
-Let’s show them.
-I can’t believe I lost a match. Huh?

332
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,306
Oh, no, it’s not--

333
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,976
[both] Allow us to reintroduce ourselves.

334
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,981
-To protect the world from devastation.
-To unite all peoples within our nation.

335
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,277
-To denounce the evils of truth and love.
-To extend our reach to the stars above.

336
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,486
-Jessie.
-James.

337
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,990
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

338
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:41,037
-Surrender now or prepare to fight.
-Meowth!

339
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,624
I love a splashy entrance.

340
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,459
[Giselle] I’ve heard of Team Rocket.

341
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,837
You’re the ones who got the worst grades
ever on the entrance exam.

342
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,592
-How about your team versus our team?
-[all] Yeah. Yeah.

343
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,596
-The two of us against all of them?
-But the rules say one on one.

344
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,058
Bad guys don’t play by the rules.
Get them!

345
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,853
-[Team Rocket groaning]
-[Jessie] Too many poke balls!

346
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,605
[James] From now on,
we play by the rules!

347
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,065
[Meowth] At least for a little while.

348
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,568
[Jessie and James] Looks like
Team Rocket’s blasting off again.

349
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,118
There are some things you just can’t
learn in school and that’s a good lesson.

350
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,997
I’m going back home to start
from scratch with my first Pokémon,

351
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,582
just like Ash did.

352
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,670
Hey, Giselle, maybe we’ll meet someday
in the Pokémon League.

353
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,296
I hope so.

354
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,591
I’ll try my hardest
to be a worthy opponent if we do.

355
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,052
All right, if I keep your picture with me?

356
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,555
Sure.
I have pictures of my friends too.

357
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,601
-Huh? Do you have mine?
-We’re friends now, aren’t we?

358
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,146
-Good luck, Joe.
-You too, Giselle.

359
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,109
See, why can’t you and I be like that,
Misty?

360
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,321
Huh? I’ll tell you exactly why.
Because he doesn’t owe her a bike.

361
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,532
Ah! [laughs]

362
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,576
So maybe we’ll battle each other
again someday.

363
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,287
-I sure hope so.
-Me too.

364
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,461
