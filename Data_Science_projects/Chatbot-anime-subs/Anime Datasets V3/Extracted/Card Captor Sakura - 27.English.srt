1
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:21,821
Who is that?

2
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,292
Who are you?

3
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:40,940
[Sakura and the Shrine of Memories]

4
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,450
Who could that be?

5
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:07,601
Oh? It’s only this early?

6
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,676
Taking a walk in the morning once
in a while is kinda nice.

7
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,674
But it feels good to be in bed too.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,717
I’ve had that dream 
when I first met Kero.

9
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,481
I also had it when I met Li-kun.

10
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,232
And then… I met Miss Mizuki yesterday.

11
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,479
Miss Kaho Mizuki…

12
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,379
What a mysterious teacher.

13
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:27,475
You think so?

14
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,714
Eh!

15
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,286
I’m sorry. Did I scare you?

16
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,682
No, I mean… Um… Good morning!

17
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,457
Good morning.

18
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,293
You get up early, Kinomoto.

19
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:45,829
I got up a little early this morning,
so I’m talking a walk.

20
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:48,099
I’m cleaning the premise of the shrine.

21
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,534
I’m the only daughter, so I got to do it.

22
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:55,502
Somehow, when I see Miss Mizuki,
I feel so sweet.

23
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,304
I’ll help you.

24
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:00,245
But how about your walk?

25
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,347
It’s no big deal.

26
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,481
Can I help too?

27
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,250
Eh!

28
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:08,355
Yukito!

29
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:17,859
Can I dump this here?

30
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:19,801
Sure. Thanks.

31
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,228
I’m glad I got up early.

32
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:33,613
Be careful.

33
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,749
As I thought, that teacher
is more than just ordinary.

34
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,752
He told me to be careful…

35
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:53,390
But as I thought, when I see Miss Mizuki,
I feel so schweeet.

36
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,474
You guys were a great help.
Thanks a lot.

37
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,909
These are chestnuts from our shrine.

38
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,275
Are you sure we can have them?

39
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:11,951
Of course!

40
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,781
Thank you very much!

41
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,079
It’s about time to go.

42
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,058
Sakura, you’re going to school, right?

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,224
Yes!

44
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:20,927
How about we go together?

45
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,727
Okay!

46
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,965
I’ll go get my bicycle.

47
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,137
Yay! I get to go with Yukito!

48
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:35,310
Kinomoto…

49
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:37,343
Yes?

50
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:49,850
It’s nothing.

51
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
If it is you, I’m sure
you will notice it yourself.

52
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:55,463
Oh?

53
00:04:59,034 --> 00:04:59,830
G’morning!

54
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,000
G’morning!

55
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,833
Tomoyo, g’morning!

56
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,433
Good morning!

57
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:10,670
When you are all cheerful in the
morning, it usually means…

58
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,139
…it is because of Tsukishiro, right?

59
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,073
It’s only half.

60
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,682
The other half is… this!

61
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:19,984
Which is…?

62
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,953
You know… 
This morning, Miss Mizuki…

63
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,021
I told you to be careful
with that teacher!

64
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:26,759
Li-kun!

65
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:30,330
But!

66
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,260
Shao Lan!

67
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:36,768
I was putting on my shoes
and you just left without me!

68
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:39,567
Oh. The chestnuts look good.

69
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,306
Do you want some, Mei Lin?

70
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,043
I can show you how to open it too.

71
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:50,111
For chestnuts, you pull it open here… 
Like this…

72
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,216
Cool!

73
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,521
Mei Lin, do you like chestnuts?

74
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,680
Oh? The math teacher, Miss Tsutsumi,
is on vacation.

75
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:24,049
They said she’s taking a long vacation.

76
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,817
The substitute teacher is…

77
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,147
…Miss Mizuki.

78
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,617
That Mizuki?

79
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,128
Father, you know Miss Mizuki?

80
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:37,589
Is that Mizuki
from Tsukimine Shrine?

81
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:38,863
Yes.

82
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:41,134
So she came back here.

83
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,294
Hey, how come you know her?

84
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:45,674
When Touya was in middle school,

85
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,606
Mizuki was a student teacher.

86
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,175
Then, Touya and Miss Mizuki
do know each other after all.

87
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,814
‘After all?’

88
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,511
Remember I was late yesterday

89
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,311
and Touya took me home?

90
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,379
And he saw Miss Mizuki

91
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:03,716
at Tsukimine Shrine then.

92
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,355
Father?

93
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,163
Did Touya say anything?

94
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,936
Nothing.

95
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,201
But when he saw Miss Mizuki,

96
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,372
he looked so surprised.

97
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,677
Are you sure you
really sensed a Clow Card?

98
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,684
It appeared just once and woke me up!

99
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,182
This can’t be wrong!

100
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,498
Tsukimine Shrine…

101
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,497
I can sense it coming out from here.

102
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,164
Are you sure? But here again?

103
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,508
The Maze card I captured
yesterday was from here, you know?

104
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,102
Is this where that mysterious teacher is?

105
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:31,308
Yeah.

106
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,246
What card is it, I wonder…

107
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:38,612
All I know is that
it’s a pretty powerful card.

108
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,580
Li-kun!

109
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,488
I know that,

110
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,483
since it could wake me up.

111
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,656
What?

112
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:47,827
Where’s Mei Lin?

113
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:49,229
I left her behind.

114
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,192
‘Coz she hasn’t finished her homework.

115
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,168
She’s still doin’ homework at this hour?

116
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,404
Mei Lin just transferred here,

117
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,567
and she isn’t familiar with Japanese!

118
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,033
She couldn’t help it, you know?

119
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,411
How about that girl
who always takes videos of yours?

120
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,011
It’s this late already,
I can’t just call her…

121
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,853
In any case… 
The card is inside this shrine.

122
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:33,666
This is strange. We should’ve been able
to tell its location right away.

123
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:38,339
It sure is nearby.

124
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:42,043
We’ve been searching inside
the shrine for almost an hour.

125
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,680
I’m sure I felt it before,

126
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,214
but now I couldn’t sense a thing.

127
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,551
I’m thirsty.

128
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,787
I wonder if there’s a vending
machine somewhere.

129
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:53,752
I want something to drink too.

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,958
Buy one for Li-kun too, okay?

131
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,537
Oh well, if I remember.

132
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:04,936
What do you mean?!

133
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,135
That’s my wallet!

134
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,346
I wonder where the card is.

135
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:17,517
It should be nearby.

136
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,222
It probably knows we’re here,
so it’s hiding.

137
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,954
But if there’s really another card here,

138
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,158
then that makes it the second one.

139
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,694
That teacher was here, wasn’t she?

140
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,292
Ye… Yeah. I saw her this morning.

141
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,065
I helped her sweep
the place and she gave me chestnuts.

142
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:40,466
You really didn’t sense anything
about that teacher?

143
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:43,977
I felt so schweeet.

144
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:45,345
Schweeet?

145
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:49,014
In any case, you could sense
something else too, right?

146
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:50,442
Ye… Yeah.

147
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:54,179
I guess people with powers are drawn
towards other things with powers.

148
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,049
You mean, me?

149
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,093
Because you have powers, that’s why
you can capture the Clow Cards, right?

150
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,723
But when I’m with Miss Mizuki,
it doesn’t feel scary at all.

151
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,160
Instead, I feel really happy.

152
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,759
Scary things

153
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,766
don’t always come
with a scary face, you know?

154
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,833
But you know, if you
think someone is nice

155
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,972
or if you like someone,

156
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,009
It’s nothing you can do
about that feeling. I feel sweet
whenever I see Yukito too.

157
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:23,510
I feel that way too…

158
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:33,358
S… So, you do l… like him…
a…after all.

159
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,128
Yo… You lie…
u… Y…Yukito too?

160
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,203
Since when?

161
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,771
Since Yukito transferred
into Touya’s school…

162
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:53,171
The third semester of Touya’s
freshmen year high school.

163
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,985
He became friends with Touya
on the first day of his transfer

164
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:58,478
and came by our house.

165
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:01,581
It… 
It might have been love at first sight.

166
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:03,782
What about you?

167
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,523
Since the day I transferred here.

168
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,989
Love at first sight after all?

169
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,792
But both of us are
so much younger than Yukito…

170
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,668
There’s nothing we can do about it.
Because we like him so much.

171
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:28,209
Wa… Wait a second, Li-kun!

172
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,728
They had the juice I like!

173
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:46,959
Sakura!

174
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:56,976
How did that happen?

175
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,544
Sakura!

176
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,945
She was sucked into the tree!

177
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:08,080
This is… The card, Return!

178
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,065
Huh? Why did I fall asleep at a place like this?

179
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,501
Um… I came to the shrine to
look for a Clow Card with Kero.

180
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,605
I saw Li-kun,

181
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,242
and we were talking here…

182
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,616
That’s right!
I got sucked in by the tree!

183
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,685
Huh? There’s nothing…

184
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,147
The cherry blossoms are falling…

185
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,782
Li-kun?

186
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,487
Not him! I gotta hide somewhere.

187
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:16,424
Oh! That’s right.

188
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,488
Jump!

189
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:32,705
Touya!

190
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,407
Maybe he’s coming back
from his part-time.

191
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,070
What should I do
if he sees me?

192
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,579
Huh? Why is he wearing
his middle school uniform?

193
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,755
You’ve come to protect us today.
Thank you.

194
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,629
Today?

195
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,497
Good evening.

196
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,760
Did you come to worship at this hour?

197
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,595
Miss Mizuki…

198
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:07,566
It came to protect us,
so I came to say hello.

199
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,073
You can tell something is
dwelling in this tree, can’t you?

200
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:14,279
You see a lot of them,
don’t you?

201
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,248
Isn’t it hard for you?

202
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:18,846
To be able to see something
others can’t see…

203
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:21,149
I’m used to it.

204
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,758
Would you tell me your name?

205
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,519
Touya Kinomoto.

206
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,793
What year?

207
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,131
Grade 8.

208
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,524
Wa… Wait a second,
he’s in 8th grade,

209
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,234
that means this was in the past?!

210
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:40,405
I’m Kaho Mizuki.
I’ll see you tomorrow again.

211
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:41,741
Eh!

212
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,146
What’s going on?!

213
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,884
Return is a card that
sends people back to the past.

214
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:57,123
But it takes a lot of magical power.
It’s rarely put in use.

215
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,951
But then why did it act all of a sudden?

216
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,831
Most likely, this tree
is closely related to this shrine

217
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,989
and has stored up lots of power.

218
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,366
It’s probably returning
her these powers.

219
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,996
Also, it’s impossible to go
back with just the will of one person…

220
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,971
Someone must have
be waiting underneath the tree.

221
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:19,247
Besides… 
Today is full moon.

222
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,285
You’re the student teacher
for our class.

223
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,423
That’s why yesterday you said
you’d see me tomorrow again.

224
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,719
I only recognize the uniform.

225
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:39,430
I didn’t know who’s in my class yet.

226
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,391
Then how did you know?

227
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,095
I just do.

228
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,034
It’s like you can see things

229
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:52,107
that other people can’t,

230
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:54,578
it’s hard to explain, you know?

231
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,005
I guess so.

232
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:58,876
This was the past after all.

233
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:03,315
I’m sure we’ll become friends.

234
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,485
Do you just know so too?

235
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,699
No. I have faith in you.

236
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,702
Touya and Miss Mizuki
really did know each other.

237
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,673
What happens if it goes on like this?

238
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,472
Before the past which Sakura is in
catches up with the present,

239
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:29,682
it’ll only go on like this.

240
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:31,718
Isn’t there something we can do?

241
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,620
There is. But…

242
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,728
Study abroad?

243
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:44,762
When?

244
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,299
Tomorrow.

245
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,861
Why didn’t you tell me?

246
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:54,070
If I told you, it would
bother you, right?

247
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:57,444
Both you and I will feel sad.

248
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:01,346
It all began under this tree.

249
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:04,080
It’s almost been a year

250
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,051
since you said, ‘I love you.’

251
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:15,052
They’re so far away, I can’t hear them…

252
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:19,730
I was really happy,
because I loved you very much too.

253
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:23,128
We had a lot of fun together.
I had a really good time.

254
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:25,970
Why are you talking in past tense…

255
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,773
Let’s say good-bye.

256
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,251
Why…?

257
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:41,585
Because… Because when we meet again

258
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,047
You would already
have someone you care about.

259
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,186
Same for me, too.

260
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:50,490
It’ll be okay.

261
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,025
Because when we meet next time,

262
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:56,095
you and I would
have become great friends.

263
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:01,508
I will come back for sure.
When the time comes…

264
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,847
What a beautiful full moon.

265
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,483
When a disaster befalls upon this world…

266
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,181
Eh!

267
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,026
Miss Mizuki!

268
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:30,064
But… I’m sure…

269
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:34,636
Sakura!

270
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,173
Sakura!

271
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,768
Kero…

272
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,745
Thank goodness. You really came back.

273
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,014
How did I…?

274
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,913
You gotta thank the brat this time.

275
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,254
Eh?

276
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,596
Sakura, that’s the true form of the card!

277
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,841
Return to thy form which thou should be!

278
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:08,900
Clow Card!

279
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,153
You did come back…

280
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,396
Li-kun!

281
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:35,299
The card that took you away
was called Return.

282
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:37,432
For Return ,

283
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:40,503
in order to stop the flow
of time by using the card Time,

284
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,604
a seal has to be placed
on the entire tree.

285
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,574
But it takes a lot of magical power

286
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,315
to use the card Time .

287
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,107
On top of that,

288
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:54,184
to stop the flow of time
in the past with magical power…

289
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:56,047
Li-kun, I’m so sorry…

290
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,853
Thank you so much!

291
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,767
Li-kun? Hang in there! Li-kun!

292
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,536
Yue…
