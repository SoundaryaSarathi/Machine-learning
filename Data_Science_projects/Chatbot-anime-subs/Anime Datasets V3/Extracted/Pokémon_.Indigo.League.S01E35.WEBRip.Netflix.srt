Then I'll just have to capture it.

Hey, Ash,
that guy is dressed just like you.

Hmm. Except it's a girl.

-How can you tell?
-Men's intuition.

-Huh?
-Who are you?

00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,936
-Tell me who you are.
-I'm Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town.

Duplica, from the House of Imitay.

53
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,902
Imitay? Like imitate?
Is that why you look just like me?

54
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,861
[chuckles] That's right.

55
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,823
You're right, Brock. She is a girl.

56
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,784
Hmm, but she may be a little young for me.

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,035
You're sad.

58
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,788
Aw. It still hasn't gotten over
that old habit.

59
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,251
Ditto.

-[giggles]
-Squishy.

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,395
And Ditto can make itself look
just like anything.

66
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,523
Hmm.
Yeah, but it's face stayed the same.

67
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,943
When it transforms,
shouldn't it be able to change completely?

68
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,154
Yeah, it still can't change its face.

69
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,741
But it's the only Pokémon
that can transform like that, right?

70
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,367
Or are there others?

71
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,328
Nope. Ditto's one of a kind.

72
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
A transforming Pokémon.

73
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,376
It's only attack is to copy other Pokémon.
That's all it does.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,003
Isn't that enough?

75
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,758
Yeah, but you can't have the fun
of teaching it different attacks.

76
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,551
That is kind of boring.

77
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,179
You think that's boring? Ha!

78
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,558
Well, that's what everyone says
who doesn't understand Ditto's real power.

-Its real power?
-Let's have a little match.

Mm-hm.

84
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,868
I chose to use my Ditto, of course.

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,536
You choose what you want.

86
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,664

Great imitations.

113
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,791
Very good, but she doesn't capture
the more adult charm

I can imitate just about anybody.

-[giggles]
-She's me.

119
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:38,273
Don't be so down, Ash.
That Ditto's powers are unbeatable.

120
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,733
Pika, pika!

121
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,401
Better than the real Pokémon.

122
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,363
I just can't believe I lost the match
to a great big fake.

123
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,158
Oh, Ash, don't think of it as a fake.

124
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,910
Ditto was battling you as real Bulbasaur.

125
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm even more impressed
by how much knowledge Duplica has.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,375
-Knowledge?
-Well, think about it.

127
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:58,877
Bulbasaur!

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,379
Why do you think Duplica had Ditto
use vine whip

129
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,549
instead of razor leaf
against your Bulbasaur?

130
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,137
Duplica must know all Bulbasaur's
potential attacks.

131
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,891
She can order Ditto
to use the strongest attack possible,

132
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,143
according to whatever Pokémon form
it takes.

133
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,311
That's right.

134
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,649
I guess that means Duplica must know
every attack of every Pokémon there is.

135
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,817
You must have studied a lot, Duplica,

136
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,071
to be able to battle in any situation
like that.

137
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,740
Oh, stop it, Brock.
You're making me blush.

138
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,992
-Pika.
-[giggles] Ditto.

139
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,204
I get it. It's more than just imitation.

140
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,957
It looks like you've got another rival,
Ash.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,459
Duplica would make
a great Pokémon master.

142
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,044
-No way.
-Huh?

143
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,547
I just want to become
the greatest Ditto master.

00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,757

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,386
You got it.
And I want to be a big star.

00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,806
Will the Machoke in the front row
please come up onto the stage?

-[man] It shouldn't look like that.

165
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,285
<i>The only trouble is Ditto hasn't been able</i>
<i>to fix this weird problem</i>

166
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,996
<i>that keeps its face</i>
<i>from transforming the right way.</i>

167
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,249
Thank you very much, Machoke,
for being a good sport.

168
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,961
Now how about this Voltorb?
Would you mind coming up to the stage?

-Voltorb.
-Okay, Ditto.

00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,224
That's so...
You can tell them apart!

174
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,642
[laughs nervously]

175
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,062
[man]
What a fake! It can't transform at all.

176
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,231
Ditto!

177
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,904
[coughing]

178
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,449
And that's what happens.

179
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,410
When people watch Ditto,

180
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,913
they don't want to see
an imperfect transformation.

181
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:44,626
This little one is trying its hardest
to master transform perfectly,

182
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,587
but its face stays the same.

183
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,588
Ditto.

184
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:53,051
-I guess being a Ditto trainer's tough.
-[all] Huh?

185
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,766
That was a touching story.

186
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,226
What? Who are you?

187
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,978
Prepare for trouble.

188
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,772
Make it double.

189
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,982
To protect the world from devastation...

190
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,819
To unite all peoples within our nation...

191
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,154
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

192
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,073
To extend our reach to the stars above...

193
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,325
-Jessie.
-James.

194
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,453
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

195
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,831
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

196
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,417
Meowth. That's right.
Let's give them a hand.

197
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,380
Okay. Show's over. Time to go back home.

198
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,258
Quiet, young twerp.
You'll be happy to know

199
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,718
we're not interested
in your Pikachu today.

200
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,719
We're here for...

201
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,054
The Ditto.

202
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,390
-Ditto!
-Stop!

203
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,642
Time for action, Weezing.

204
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,897
Weezing.

205
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,863
[grunting and coughing]

206
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,531
Oh, no, my Ditto's gone!

207
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,954
Team Rocket.
What are they up to this time?

208
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,665
[chuckling]

209
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,669
[Jessie]
Cute little Ditto. Our little Ditto.

210
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,630
Why didn't we think of this before?
Now we're unstoppable.

211
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,508
Right. Now we can take our names
off the loser list

212
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,176
and put them in the winning column.

213
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,138
And the boss will make me top cat again.

214
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,475
All right, little Ditto,
we have a little favor to ask you.

215
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,643
Ditto?

216
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,605
[Jessie] Transform into this.

217
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,815
Won't you, please?
Please? Pretty please?

218
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,569
Become Dratini, the Pokémon
we've never been able to capture.

219
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,072
It would make a handsome gift
for the boss.

220
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:44,120
Sir, we've finally captured Dratini,
that legendary Pokémon.

221
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,080
Yes. Well done.

222
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,083
I will reward you lavishly
for your hard work.

223
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,046
From now on, you will take my place
as the head of Team Rocket.

224
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,090
[chuckles] Your wish is my command.

225
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,970
Let's do it. Let's make it change
right this second, Jessie.

226
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,889
-What's the hurry?
-Hmm?

227
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,058
Since Ditto is ours for the moment,

228
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,394
let's have some fun
before we hand it over to the boss.

229
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,396
-Some fun?
-Ditto.

230
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,316
What would the person in this picture
look like if he were an adult?

231
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,860
-Ditto?
-Transform and show me.

232
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,987
Whose picture is that? Let me see.

233
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,324
-No way. This is personal. James, stop it.
-Let me see.

234
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,450
Let's see.

235
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,494
Ha! It's a little boy.

236
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,664
Ooh! Jessie has a boyfriend?

237
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,541
He was my first true love.

238
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,961
-First love?
-Show me?

239
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,671
Ditto.

240
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,424
-Huh?
-[both laughing]

241
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,761
Your first love
sure has an interesting face.

242
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,389
Especially if you're interested in Ditto.

243
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,307
[both grunting and groaning]

244
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,558
That wasn't funny.

245
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,937
Is that your idea of a transformation?

246
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,896
-Ditto.
-Huh?

247
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,273
[both laughing]

248
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,567
[grunting and groaning]

249
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,277
Now do as I say!

250
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,239
Transform into this.

251
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
-Ditto.
-[all groan]

252
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm beginning to see a flaw in this plan.

253
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,374
How dare you insult us like this!

254
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,544
I'm warning you,
you'd better transform perfectly this time

255
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,045
or I'll transform you into jelly.

256
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,506
[whimpering] Ditto.

257
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,969
[Misty]
Don't worry, Duplica. Cheer up.

258
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,971
We'll all help you find Ditto.

259
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,641
We've already sent Pidgeotto and Zubat
out on surveillance.

260
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,643
There you go. See?

261
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,187
Yeah. Thanks, you guys.

262
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,690
Hey, Ash. What's on your mind?

263
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,192
Well, it's just Ditto's transform.

264
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,946
You can't forget how important
the trainer's ability is too.

265
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,033
It's not the Pokémon
but the trainer who decides

266
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,493
which attack to use in a battle, right?

267
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,871
And that means that if you raise a Ditto,

268
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,166
its progress and power
are connected directly to your own.

269
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,753
Yeah. I think you're definitely right
about that, Ash.

270
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,130
Sounds like you've been studying, Ash.

271
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,590
[squawks]

272
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,635
-Pika, pika?
-[squawks]

273
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,930
-Pikachu, did they see Ditto anywhere?
-Pika!

274
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,349
-Let's go save Ditto.
-Yeah.

275
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,893
-[Duplica] Wait.
-[all] Huh?

276
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,353
I think I have an idea.

277
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,232
What's wrong with you?
Why can't you get it right?

278
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,444
I don't have a goofy face like that.

279
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,696
Get it right this time, Ditto,
or you'll regret it.

280
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:28,159
-That's right.
-[whimpering] Ditto. Ditto.

281
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,620
-Oh!
-Success.

282
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,247
You really can do it if you try.
Great job, Ditto.

283
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,208
Now how about a Dratini?

284
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
-Sorry, Meowth.
-[both] Huh?

285
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,462
-Hey!
-[both] Huh?

286
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,841
[dramatic music playing over speaker]

287
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,676
Prepare for trouble.

288
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,553
And make it "double" double.

289
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,890
[groans] Quit imitating us.

290
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,476
To protect the world from devastation...

291
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,353
To ignite all peoples within our nation...

292
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,897
[growls] This is insulting.

293
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,400
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

294
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,610
To extend our reach to the stars above...

295
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,279
-Ash.
-Misty.

296
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,614
And Brock.

297
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,075
Duplica. That's right.

298
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,453
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

299
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,832
Surrender now
or prepare to fight all of us.

300
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,083
Pika, pika.

301
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,043
[Misty]
That was great to do the whole thing.

302
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,005
[Ash] Now I know why they like saying
all that dumb stuff so much. It's fun.

303
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,842
Hey, I know,
maybe we should all become actors.

304
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,969
-Pika, pika.
-[all laughing]

305
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,721
Team Rocket is not something
to be made fun of,

306
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,182
but if you're going to imitate us,
at least do it right.

307
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,853
To unite all peoples within our nation.
Not ignite.

308
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,147
We'll be taking Ditto back now.

309
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,857
No way.

310
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,859
No way.

311
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,319
[both chuckling]

312
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey, I can't tell which one is which.

313
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,534
But I thought
that Ditto couldn't imitate faces.

314
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,662
That's true,
but Ditto was finally perfected

315
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,999
under the expert care and training
of Team Rocket.

316
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,417
[both laughing]

317
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,461
-[Duplica] Oh, thank you.
-[both] Huh?

318
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,923
I've tried everything I could think of
to get Ditto to imitate faces.

319
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,343
Now Ditto can finally become
the kind of Pokémon

320
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,387
I always knew it could be.

321
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,763
Duplica.

322
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,849
-That's beautiful.
-Yeah.

323
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,270
-That's so beautiful I can't stand it.
-[James] Neither can I.

324
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,608
Hey, you guys, why don't we just
solve this without a big battle?

325
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,278
All right. We'll do it your way this time.

326
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,071
We'll just give you Ditto.

327
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,366
Hey. What are you doing?

328
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,827
We'll be on our way now.

329
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,001
-Goodbye, everyone.
-Good luck with Ditto.

330
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,712
-Hold it right there!
-[screaming]

331
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,381
Hey, Duplica, what are you doing?

332
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,592
-This isn't Ditto.
-Huh?

333
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,220
Hey, let me go, will you? Ah!

334
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,056
[screams and groans]

335
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,475
Impossible. How could you tell?

336
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,769
It was a perfect transformation.

337
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,062
[sneezes]

338
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,272
[Jessie squealing]

339
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,941
[squealing]

340
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,195
[giggles]
I wouldn't be much of a trainer

341
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,948
if I couldn't see through
that transformation, would I, Ditto?

342
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,409
Dimwits!
How'd you manage to mess this one up?

343
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,246
You are in no position to complain.

344
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,373
It's time for plan B.

345
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,293
[all gasp]

346
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,128
Stop! You can't do this!

347
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,341
Quiet, all of you!
We're going to win after all.

348
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,095
Ditto, transform now!

349
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,555
Ditto!

350
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,018
That's great.

351
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,188
I didn't know Ditto could transform
into things like that.

352
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,232
-Pikachu.
-Pikachu!

353
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,485
Pikachu, aim!

354
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,861
Ditto, fire!

355
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,783
Fire!

356
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,788
Chu!

357
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,376
[screaming]

358
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,752
Ah!

359
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,048
Jessie, we lose everything.

360
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,259
Even all our hot air.

361
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,681
[together] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again!

362
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,270
-Ditto.
-That was great.

363
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,939
You've learned
how to completely transform.

364
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,651
Ditto, would you please transform
into a Pikachu?

365
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,820
Ditto.

366
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,323
-Pikachu.
-Pi?

367
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,116
-Pika.
-Pika.

368
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,120
That's amazing.
Ditto transforms perfectly.

369
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,955
Ha. I can hardly believe it.

370
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,583
Team Rocket was actually good
for something.

371
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,462
Yeah, and the way Ditto transforms
into objects is great.

372
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,048
You're just as real as the real thing.

373
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,842
Hey, Ditto, great job.

374
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,303
-Pika?
-Pika.

375
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,556
But now I can't tell
which one's my Pikachu.

376
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,892
Then I guess you need to keep training,
Ashy-boy.

377
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,893
[Ash groans]

378
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,564
-Right, Ditto?
-Ditto.

379
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,651
Ah. [chuckles]

380
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,486
Pikachu.

381
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,447
Ditto. Ditto. [giggles]

382
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,286
There. The Imitay House is reopened.

383
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,538
[Ash laughs] Congratulations.

384
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,625
-[Misty] You did it, Duplica.
-Thanks for everything.

385
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,460
Come back and see us anytime, okay?

386
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,381
Good luck!
And take of yourself, Ditto master!

387
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,677
Imagine, the strength of all the Pokémon
in one.

388
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,513
Maybe I'll capture a Ditto
for myself someday.

389

393
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,904
-[Meowth] Hey! What are you doing?
-[Jessie] Hold still.

394
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,200
[Meowth] Stop it. Let me go!
Cut it out, will you? Ow! Quit it!

395
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,411
Will you stop it, Meowth?

396
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,329
The only way we can get out of this mess

397
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,332
is to dress you up like a Dratini
and present you to the boss.

398
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,876
Pea brains. This won't work.

399
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,878
Take that! And that!

00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,548
