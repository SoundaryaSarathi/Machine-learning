1
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,320
Siblings, she says?

2
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,920
That sort of twist... is impossible!

3
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,130
It seems so impossible that it's almost on the same level as a joke.

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,540
Besides, above all,

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,670
...we don't look alike.

6
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,770
What will make us look alike?

7
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
Like this?

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,040
Like this?

9
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,980
I don't have a clue what Mom told her,

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,960
But something like that just isn't possible.

11
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,470
What will happen if it's true?

12
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,210
Will I give up on Hiromi?

13
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,750
How stupid... I was supposed to give up on her before that.

14
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,320
Got you! Got you!

15
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,810
Sorry, but I don't feel like eating.

16
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,790
Why don't you feel like eating?

17
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,810
"Why"?

18
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,000
You're still troubled, aren't you?

19
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,240
Let's think about it together!

20
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,070
What are you talking about?

21
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,250
Didn't you say you feel anxious when I'm around?

22
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,740
But I think that's wrong.

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,940
Huh?

24
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,540
You are troubled because you're alone.

25
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,230
Even if it's dark,

26
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,730
If someone is there by your side, you'll definitely feel much stronger.

27
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,610
You will surely find the answer!

28
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,020
I will help Shinichirou with that!

29
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,830
So, try telling me!

30
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,330
Impossible.

31
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
You won't understand.

32
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,290
I... won't understand?

33
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,310
Yeah...

34
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,820
Here, take this back.

35
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,900
Ground, today I'm giving you a huge sin as a present.

36
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,430
You understand, right, Ground?

37
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,770
I... don't understand.

38
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,820
Hey, Hiromi.

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,380
You aren't eating lunch today again?

40
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,670
Ho- Hold-!

41
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,820
A bento.

42
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,710
I'm sorry, but right now...

43
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,030
Eat it.

44
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,570
Crap...

45
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,570
It's delicious!

46
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,540
Eat it all up.

47
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,960
Here, potato.

48
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,290
Here's some fried meat.

49
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Wait a bit!

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,350
I still haven't completely swallowed the potato.

51
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,990
Then apologize.

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,610
Apologize to Shinichirou.

53
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,030
Even if he could really fly, Shinichirou isn't looking at the sky.

54
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,910
He's avoiding looking at the sky.

55
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,700
I think that this is your fault.

56
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,890
I understand what's wrong after observing you.

57
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,750
You won't be able to fly,

58
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,800
ever.

59
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,810
Since you can't fly, it troubled Shinichirou, who can fly.

60
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,620
Just strange, isn't it?

61
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,320
What?

62
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,930
What the hell is that?

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,430
All you've done is talking,

64
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,790
but you don't understand anything!

65
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,050
That's unfair!

66
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,210
What is?

67
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,290
That I don't understand!

68
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,280
If you just explain it to me, would I not understand?!

69
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,540
Let go!

70
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,280
There are only mysteries revolving around you.

71
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,550
You won't even tell me about what's going on between you and Jun.

72
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,710
We aren't friends anymore if you don't tell me what's going on!

73
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,830
Since when were we friends anyway?!

74
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,930
They've started...

75
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,730
Hiromi!

76
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,920
Hey, is that a fight?

77
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,890
Damn, girls sure are scary.

78
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,680
Wha...

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,380
Hiromi!

80
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,450
Hiromi, wait!

81
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,880
Man...

82
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
this is troublesome.

83
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,810
What happened?

84
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,930
Hey, Noe...

85
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,690
Why won't the two of you tell me anything?

86
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
Why don't you just tell me what's wrong if I don't understand?

87
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,360
If not, we can't think about it together,

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,760
and then I can't be of any help to you, you know?

89
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,140
All I want is to understand you more!

90
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,890
It really hurts to see Shinichirou troubled!

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,190
It's really painful!

92
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,280
And yet, there's nothing I can do to help...

93
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,270
She... could it be that...

94
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,510
Could it be that...

95
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,540
you like me?

96
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,190
I do like you,

97
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,920
only you can continue Raigoumaru's will.

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,250
I don't mean that kind of like.

99
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,520
What do you mean by like?

100
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,080
Uh... well...

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,530
Like the kind where you go out together...

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,180
...what you'd classify as love.

103
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,550
Noe!

104
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,940
Noe likes me.

105
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,080
And, Hiromi likes Noe's brother.

106
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,500
Also, I like Hiromi.

107
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,330
But, Hiromi and I are...

108
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,390
like that's possible!

109
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,230
He's starting to get well on his posing.

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,830
Perhaps he's getting into it now.

111
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,870
Yeah.

112
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,310
Everyone's praising you back there.

113
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,330
You don't seem very happy...

114
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,610
Not really...

115
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,940
Hey, Shinichirou,

116
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,610
Um, remember when you helped me measure the sweater's size?

117
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,810
If you'd like... because...

118
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,790
I knit pretty fast, so...

119
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,560
I could make one for Shinichirou as well...

120
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,550
Who is this girl?

121
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,590
Aren't you going out with Noe?

122
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,330
Hey, what's he talking about?

123
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,300
Ai-chan, go on ahead.

124
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,340
Please.

125
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,520
Now then,

126
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,010
I've been dating Hiromi,

127
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,050
So why don't you hurry up and start going out with Noe?

128
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,040
I never promised that!

129
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,620
You're the one who proposed it, right?

130
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,240
Well...

131
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,010
If you don't keep your promise, it's over between me and Hiromi.

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,550
How long are you going to be this selfish?!

133
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,400
What's wrong?

134
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,230
Well...

135
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,820
At any rate, just keep your promise.

136
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,220
That's all.

137
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,440
Is Shinichirou dating?

138
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,690
But, I'm sure whoever Shinichirou likes, it's not that Noe girl.

139
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,810
But...

140
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,800
Oh no...

141
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,580
Shinichirou?

142
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,220
Whoa! Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold!

143
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,980
Don't you think it's getting extremely cold tonight?

144
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,060
Well, to be flirting in a cold place is kind of romantic, too...

145
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,820
You know...

146
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,620
Ah, yeah, how's that sweater coming?

147
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,290
Aah, I wan't to wear it soon!

148
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,240
It's a sweater made by my girlfriend, after all,

149
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,650
I never would have expected one!

150
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,420
I'm sorry...

151
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,900
I can't make you one, after all.

152
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,870
Eh? Why's that...?

153
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,050
We- Well! It's all right!

154
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,120
I bet Ai-chan's not skilled enough,

155
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,530
But that's also a part of you that I-

156
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,660
Stop being kind to me!

157
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,690
I don't deserve your kindness.

158
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,500
Ai-chan?

159
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,270
It was here, right?

160
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,780
This is where Shinichirou told me how you feel.

161
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,790
You know, I...

162
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,380
...actually...

163
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,940
...long before that happened...

164
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,870
...actually...

165
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,550
Well, isn't it cold?

166
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,580
Let's go back to the store.

167
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,970
Hold on! I haven't said every-

168
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm sorry, but I'm sure I don't want to hear what you were getting at.

169
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,550
Let's hold hands on our way back.

170
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,150
Hey...

171
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,650
All I have is Ai-chan.

172
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,050
There's only you...

173
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,310
About what happened yesterday...

174
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,170
You-

175
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,820
Could you fix what I told you to as soon as possible?

176
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,070
It's fine, right? I'm counting on you.

177
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,140
Is Mom making you work again?

178
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,040
Shinichirou.

179
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,170
Did Mom say something to you?

180
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,660
No... not really.

181
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,970
Nothing.

182
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,830
I've started thinking about Noe's feelings...

183
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,400
Because all I've been thinking of was Hiromi...

184
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,310
I never thought there can be any romantic feelings between us.

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,460
I like her, right?

186
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,190
Probably.

187
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,040
If I didn't like her, there's no way I'd let her push me around so much.

188
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah...

189
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,680
It's not just because of some promise...

190
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm home.

191
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,560
Noe...

192
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,540
Stay away!

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,260
I've changed since yesterday.

194
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,510
It seems I've fallen in love.

195
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,520
Since a while back... different parts of my body feel hot...

196
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,520
My face, my chest, my ears...

197
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,770
Hey, what should I do, onii-chan?

198
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,360
I've changed...

199
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,070
I feel so embarrassed, I can't look at Shinichirou's face anymore!

200
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,120
It's fine.

201
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,810
There's nothing wrong with changing.

202
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,090
Really?

203
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah, it's fine.

204
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,680
No, in fact, you <i>must</i> change.

205
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,100
It's so cold!

206
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
We're going to another building, so we'll have to endure it.

207
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,700
In addition, if it's this cold it's definitively going to snow tonight!

208
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,330
Will we even make it through till evening?

209
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,560
Wanna bet?

210
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,940
Alright, then...

211
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,550
What's wrong?

212
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,240
What is it?

213
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,250
Snow...

214
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,910
Snow?!

215
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,510
What should we eat tonight?

216
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,280
Well, it's snowing, so why not udon?

217
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,060
Eh? Didn't we eat udon yesterday as well?

218
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,580
Then, what do you think about ramen?

219
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,230
Hey Miyokichi, it's time for lunch...

220
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,730
Sure, I agree.

221
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,730
Then, hold on for a second.

222
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,970
I don't feel like eating today.

223
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,630
Okay!

224
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,450
Are you feeling bad?

225
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,110
Nah, I just ate too much during breakfast.

226
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,360
Well then, I guess I'll go eat with someone else.

227
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,870
You're... cool, I guess.

228
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm okay with it. If it's you...

229
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,500
You know, I think you really should go see a doctor.

230
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,010
Eh- hey!

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,900
That's not what I meant.

232
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,360
Noe!

233
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,280
Hey, don't you have lunch for me today?

234
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,060
There's none!

235
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,390
None, none!

236
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't have any!

237
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,500
Hey! Noe!

238
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,760
Hey! Wait! Come on, wait!

239
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,090
Let go!

240
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,850
I bet you'll just run away if I let go.

241
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,950
I'm not running away...

242
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,810
See? You <i>are</i> running away.

243
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,650
Be- Because...

244
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,370
Because... of what?

245
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,690
Why are you mad?

246
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm not mad.

247
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,780
What about you, why are you running away?

248
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,110
Then, why are you chasing me?

249
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,130
Well...

250
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,100
I have something to tell you!

251
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,920
What is it?

252
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,090
What? Hurry up and say it!

253
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,240
If there's nothing, then why should I stop?

254
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,060
Tell me, in three seconds, what do you want to say?

255
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,100
G-Go...

256
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,550
Go out with me!

257
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,760
"Go out"? What do you mean?

258
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,530
Are you saying you like me in a romantic way?

259
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,810
That's right...

260
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,310
Tell me properly.

261
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,070
Eh?

262
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
That you like me.

263
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,780
I like you, Noe.

264
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,150
Write it down here.

265
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,660
Eh?

266
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,600
Write it down?

267
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,310
I can't find anything more that will fit.

268
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,790
There aren't enough stones.

269
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,870
I need only two more...

270
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,750
No way...

271
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,020
They'll get dirty!

272
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,840
It's fine.

273
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,630
It's done.

274
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,380
Right now... I want to cry.

275
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,360
Why is that?

276
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,740
I'm not even sad...

277
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,960
But... I really, really want to cry.

278
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,200
Because I'm happy...

279
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,760
It must be because I'm happy.

280
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,610
She... really does like me.

281
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,840
Whoa... looks like it'll build up.

282
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,010
Huh?

283
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,550
Come on, what's wrong? What are you doing?!

284
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,580
Come on, you'll catch yourself a cold.

285
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,630
Hey, about last time...

286
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,770
Um, I've started going out with Noe.

287
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,840
I don't think I understand it clearly myself...

288
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,050
Ai-chan...

289
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,670
Wait!

290
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,280
Shinichirou!

291
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,070
Ai-chan...

292
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,830
Please...

293
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,260
Look at me too...

294
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,470
Please...

295
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,390
Shinichirou...

296
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,130
Is it okay if I fall in love with you even more?

297
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,810
With such a docile face, she was easily able to catch a man's heart.

298
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,810
It's a game.

299
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,610
A town where it doesn't snow...
