<i>[Episode 23]</i>

3
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,181
<i>Ye Hua.</i>

4
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:24,424
<i>Ye Hua?</i>

5
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,427
Ye Hua.

6
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,377
Are you asleep?

7
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:31,864
No.

8
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:33,961
Is Nai Nai in your room?

9
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:39,459
Nai Nai is already in bed.

10
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,020
I heard from Nai Nai that...

11
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,310
The battle in Far North is dire.

12
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:55,918
Are you all right?

13
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,581
I'm doing very well.

14
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:04,657
We...

15
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:08,500
We haven't seen each other
for half a year.

16
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,008
Ye Hua.

17
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,548
Listen.

18
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:20,171
The baby... has been moving around
a lot these days.

19
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,626
<i>Sometimes, I can feel
his hands and feet.</i>

20
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:31,265
I don't want him to be born too soon.

21
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,562
I'm worried that you won't
get to see him be born.

22
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>Ye Hua, I'd like to know...</i>

23
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:47,757
<i>That day...</i>

24
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,706
<i>At the Lakes of the Far East...</i>

25
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:55,721
<i>The oath that we made...
Does that still count?</i>

26
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:04,991
I want to wait until our child is born
to tell him the story of his parents.

27
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,800
Then he will know what
his father has on his mind.

28
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,483
It does count.

29
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,690
I know now.

30
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,177
Take care.

31
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:28,019
I await your return.

32
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,348
Little chap.

33
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,944
Your father will soon
return to the palace.

34
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:51,665
You have to grow slowly.

35
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:55,007
Then he can see you when you're born.

36
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,038
That would be the best.

37
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,492
My prince, great victory!

38
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:13,637
Keep talking.

39
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,918
Ghost Lord Li Jing made use
of the freezing weather

40
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,420
and transported much ice upstream.

41
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,569
Then he used his powers to melt the ice.

42
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,240
Then he borrowed the Celestial Tribe's
powers of rain and thunder

43
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,050
to create rainfall
for three days and nights.

44
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,668
It caused great flooding
across the lands of the Far North.

45
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:28,533
Our enemies were defeated
without a fight.

46
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,935
This is...

47
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,757
That is to say...

48
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,399
Not only did it take out all the rebels

49
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,398
but also the creatures
of the Ghost Realm are...

50
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:37,829
Indeed.

51
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,230
He is indeed Qing Cang's son.

52
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,754
The Ghost Realm isn't the territory
of the Celestial Tribe.

53
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:45,771
We deployed our army to assist the
Ghost Tribe in pacifying their rebels.

54
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:48,295
However, I find it hard
to accept such a method!

55
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:49,757
Split the army into five troops.

56
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:52,456
Send one to the flooded areas
and save as many as possible.

57
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:55,029
As for the other four, set out
as agreed with the Ghost Lord

58
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,927
to seal off the four routes
of the Far North.

59
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,252
Intercept and defeat the enemy.

60
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:59,459
- Yes!
- Yes!

61
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,699
Li Yuan!

62
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,826
Tens of thousands of years went by.

63
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:45,543
Who knew that we would meet again
in combat after all these years?

64
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,947
Li Jing.

65
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,906
You're so ruthless.

66
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,074
You've disregarded the lives of thousands
of creatures in the Ghost Realm.

67
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:58,069
You collaborated with the Celestial Tribe
to wipe them out!

68
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,218
You're wrong!

69
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,093
You're the one who harmed them.

70
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,999
If you hadn't asked them to support you

71
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,838
they wouldn't have died so tragically.

72
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,406
Yan Zhi.

73
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:15,795
Since Father was sealed
how have I treated you?

74
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,487
Brother Li Jing...

75
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,598
Why have you chosen to assist that man?

76
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,173
Brother Li Jing.

77
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,848
I... I don't wish to go
against either of you.

78
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:29,264
I don't want either of you dead.

79
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:36,502
All these years, I've stayed by Li Yuan's
side so that he wouldn't hurt you.

80
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,603
- Take them down!
- Yes!

81
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:19,812
Li Jing! If you want to kill me
do so yourself!

82
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:22,103
How dare you send
such lowly subordinates?

83
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,949
I don't want you dead.

84
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,555
My brother.

85
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:27,415
Fine!

86
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,343
I'll take you to Father then!

87
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,038
Brother Li Yuan! You promised!

88
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:38,504
You said that you wouldn't
attack Brother Li Jing!

89
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:39,716
Get lost!

90
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,365
Brother Li Yuan!

91
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,270
Golden Lion!

92
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,811
My princess...

93
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,934
You have lived up to
my expectations after all.

94
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:45,365
All of you have worked hard.

95
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,158
Great blessings to the Heavenly Lord!

96
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,884
You're blessed by the Heavenly Father!

97
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,258
<i>Consort!</i>

98
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,730
Consort.

99
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,027
The Crown Prince has returned
to the palace in victory.

100
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,081
He's discussing matters with
the Heavenly Lord now.

101
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:38,380
Deliver this card to
the Hall of Beautiful Youth now.

102
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,471
Tell the lady that she's been invited
to Lotus Pond to admire flowers

103
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,239
and most female family members
of the Celestial Palace will attend.

104
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,644
Should any guards outside
the Hall of Beautiful Youth keep you out

105
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:52,254
tell them that the Heavenly Lord
has lifted the house arrest.

106
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,023
Yes, Consort.

107
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,023
This is an invitation from
Consort Su Jin.

108
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:15,308
She's invited female family members of
the Celestial Palace to admire flowers.

109
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,609
The Heavenly Lord has agreed to let the
Hall of Beautiful Youth's lady attend.

110
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,277
This is...

111
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,519
If you don't believe me, you may check.

112
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,235
Please enter, Fairy.

113
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,458
My lady, walk more slowly.

114
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,498
I'm getting bigger now.

115
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,908
It wears me out just to take a few steps.

116
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:53,528
You are due soon.

117
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,279
You could have turned
the invitation down.

118
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,184
Why would you insist on
coming to Lotus Pond?

119
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,916
All female family members in
the Celestial Palace are attending.

120
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,330
I'm Ye Hua's wife.
How could I not attend?

121
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,591
Lady Su Su is the only female family
member in Xiwu Palace.

122
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,913
You and the Crown Prince
were married in the Far East.

123
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:12,337
They have to acknowledge that.

124
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,696
Lady Su Su is the Crown Prince's wife.

125
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:35,696
Su Su.

126
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,717
How unfortunate.

127
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,066
I heard that Ye Hua has just
returned to the palace.

128
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:45,027
The Heavenly Lord has just
canceled the gathering.

129
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,172
Everyone has gone to welcome Ye Hua.

130
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:49,388
Ye Hua has already returned?

131
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:50,779
Exactly.

132
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,682
I'm waiting right here
to bring you over to him.

133
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,677
Great. Please take me to him now.

134
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:58,914
Let's go.

135
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:11,769
- Consort.
- Consort.

136
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:20,660
Let's go.

137
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,558
Let go of me!

138
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,311
Have you forgotten who you are?

139
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:44,491
A celestial maid from the Lower Realm
has the lowest rank.

140
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,866
How dare you speak
before Consort Su Jin?

141
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,835
Lady Su Su is pregnant.

142
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,683
She can't go to a place with
a malicious aura like Zhuxian Terrace.

143
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:52,927
Lady Su Su!

144
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,275
My Lady!

145
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:03,892
What is going on?

146
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,267
Let's go.

147
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,456
But...

148
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,817
Let's go.

149
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,342
Why would Father suddenly
give Su Jin to you?

150
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:20,374
How is this a gift?

151
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:22,211
He's deliberately forcing you
to have her!

152
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,494
This can't be that simple.

153
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,370
Congratulations, Your Highness!

154
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,075
Not only did you defeat the rebels

155
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,254
but you also won yourself a beauty!

156
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,583
Your Highness should treat the heir
of a loyal tribe kindly.

157
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:40,655
Your Highness, I...

158
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:41,750
Your Highness!

159
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,025
Consort Su Jin has had
an argument with Lady Su Su.

160
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,562
No, that isn't true!

161
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,586
Your Highness!

162
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:03,381
Do you know that the Heavenly Lord is
hosting a conferring ceremony for Ye Hua?

163
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,292
He's going to make me Ye Hua's concubine.

164
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,880
Ye Hua and I share mutual affections.

165
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,673
The Nine Heavens were never meant
for a woman like you.

166
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:26,684
After you give birth to the child,
jump off Zhuxian Terrace.

167
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:28,937
Head back to where you should.

168
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,922
Does Ye Hua want me to leave?

169
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,346
I am his wife.

170
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,100
I should stay by his side.

171
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,379
You really think so?

172
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,226
Ye Hua!

173
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,794
Ye Hua...

174
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,716
Don't blame Su Su.

175
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:16,682
I believe that she didn't
mean to push me.

176
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:20,150
It's just that she's heard about

177
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,619
the Heavenly Lord's decision
to give me to you.

178
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,394
She became too agitated.

179
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,128
Ye Hua...

180
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:28,918
I didn't push her.

181
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,869
- I didn't push her.
- Ye Hua...

182
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,503
- Believe me.
- Crown Prince!

183
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,190
- Crown Prince!
- Ye Hua, believe me!

184
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,105
I didn't push her, Ye Hua!

185
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,898
I really didn't push her!

186
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,994
- Believe me!
- That's enough!

187
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,615
I only believe what I saw.

188
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,642
I didn't push her!

189
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:54,913
Ye Hua...

190
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,279
Ye Hua!

191
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,390
Ye Hua...

192
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,062
I didn't push her.

193
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:04,913
Take her back
to the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

194
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,813
She's not to go anywhere
without my permission.

195
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,857
Lady Su Su.

196
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:20,486
I didn't push her...

197
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:36,153
Ye Hua.

198
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,075
Do you know how happy I was
when I heard

199
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,265
the Heavenly Lord's decision
to give me to you?

200
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,053
I've already sent for the Medicine King.

201
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,431
Don't say another word.

202
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:03,971
Su Jin!

203
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,420
Uncle.

204
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,761
What exactly happened?

205
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:14,071
When I got there, I witnessed Su Jin
feign a conflict with Su Su.

206
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,048
She pretended to be pushed
by Su Su and jumped down to frame her.

207
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,720
Su Jin jumped?

208
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,781
If I had know, I'd have held
the generals off.

209
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:35,817
If accused of pushing
the Heavenly Lord's concubine

210
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,976
off Zhuxian Terrace,
that woman will be killed!

211
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,507
What do you intend to do?

212
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:44,244
What else can I do, Uncle Lian Song?

213
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:46,989
If I speak up for Su Su

214
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:50,463
the Heavenly Lord will be more inclined
to sentence her to death!

215
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:52,492
But you...

216
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,328
- Heavenly Lord.
- Father.

217
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:06,789
- Medicine King.
- Yes.

218
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,165
What happened?

219
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,436
Why are the consort's eyes hurt?

220
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:18,211
Heavenly Lord.

221
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,000
Heavenly Lord, Her Highness
was going to treat the female members

222
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,555
of the Celestial Palace to a banquet.

223
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:26,189
However, the Crown Prince returned
so she canceled the banquet.

224
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,644
Who knew...

225
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,647
Who knew that mortal from
the Hall of Beautiful Youth

226
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,819
would take her to Zhuxian Terrace?

227
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:35,182
I don't know what she said to the consort

228
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,006
but she suddenly pushed
Her Highness over the edge.

229
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:41,159
Fortunately, the Crown Prince
arrived in time.

230
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,305
Her Highness managed
to survive the accident.

231
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:46,422
What?

232
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:49,713
That woman dared to harm the consort?

233
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,406
How outrageous!

234
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,346
Consort Su Jin is the heir
of a loyal tribe.

235
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,701
All of her tribesmen sacrificed
for the Celestial Tribe.

236
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,990
Even us, the commanders of the sub-tribes

237
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,010
and even the Heavenly Lord treats her
kindly with great care.

238
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,624
That mere mortal!

239
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,730
How dare she push the consort
off Zhuxian Terrace?

240
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,887
Heavenly Lord!

241
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:08,998
Crown Prince!

242
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,538
That mortal must not be spared.

243
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,189
She must be pushed off Zhuxian Terrace.

244
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:15,351
Only when her soul disintegrates
can it make up for Su Jin's eyes!

245
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:16,451
Exactly!

246
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,935
That mortal must not be spared!

247
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:19,289
Heavenly Lord.

248
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:23,664
That mortal is carrying
the Crown Prince's child.

249
00:20:23,664 --> 00:20:26,361
She must have found out that
Su Jin has been given to Ye Hua

250
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:27,631
and pushed her by accident?

251
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,746
By accident?

252
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,175
Do you call this an accident?

253
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,545
Look at her!

254
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:32,734
Take a good look at her!

255
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,861
The consort's eyes are ruined!

256
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,729
Uncles...

257
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:40,923
Don't...

258
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,695
Don't be angry at that mortal.

259
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,316
After all, she is already pregnant
with the Crown Prince's child.

260
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,946
She didn't mean to do this to me.

261
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,648
You don't have to say a word.

262
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:00,517
I'll uphold justice for you.

263
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:03,141
Heavenly Lord!

264
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,776
Ye Hua.

265
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,455
Su Jin is the heir of a loyal tribe.

266
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,104
The Celestial Tribe
should treat her kindly.

267
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:23,040
However, she has now been
severely injured by Su Su.

268
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,645
If this matter isn't handled well,
my officials might be disheartened.

269
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,931
How do you think Su Su
should be punished to appease everyone

270
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,494
and to uphold justice for Su Jin?

271
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,441
Nai Nai...

272
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,442
You must testify for me.

273
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,507
I didn't push her.

274
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,131
She set me up for all of this.

275
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:55,561
Lady Su Su...

276
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,509
When I got to Zhuxian Terrace

277
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,138
Consort Su Jin was already
in the Crown Prince's arms.

278
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:04,354
Do you also think that I pushed her?

279
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:05,991
No, I'd never think that you did that!

280
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:08,607
Lady Su Su...

281
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,946
You witnessed it last time.

282
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:17,732
Even if I testify for you,
no one will believe me.

283
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:22,926
You're right.

284
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,476
Even if you could testify for me...

285
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,930
no one would believe you.

286
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,601
Even Ye Hua doesn't believe me.

287
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,439
Why would the others?

288
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:43,731
Ye Hua and Su Jin
are childhood sweethearts.

289
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:46,009
He loves her so deeply.

290
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,698
He surely won't believe me.

291
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:50,587
Lady Su Su, what are you talking about?

292
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:52,182
You mustn't say such nonsense.

293
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:54,212
Su Jin is the Heavenly Lord's concubine.

294
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,048
She won't be. Not for long.

295
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:02,260
What did you say?

296
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:08,719
She's been given to Ye Hua
as his side consort.

297
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,153
What?

298
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,863
I didn't push her.

299
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,799
Ye Hua won't just believe
her side of the story.

300
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,885
There were so many others around.

301
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,994
So many people witnessed it.

302
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:27,570
Someone must have seen
that I didn't push her.

303
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,096
It wasn't me.

304
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:31,528
It shouldn't...

305
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:32,769
Lady Su Su!

306
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,838
What's wrong?

307
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,878
Is anyone out there?

308
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:38,074
Lady Su Su!

309
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:39,153
What's wrong?

310
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,355
Heavenly Lord is right.

311
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:54,128
I didn't see very clearly either.

312
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:57,992
I only heard from the consort
that Su Su didn't do it intentionally.

313
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,788
Although it wasn't intentional...

314
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,199
the consort's eyes were still injured.

315
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,057
As a mortal, she pushed
a celestial consort off Zhuxian Terrace.

316
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:12,653
Su Su's action is not to be condoned.

317
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:19,943
I wonder if it would appease everyone
to hand over Su Su's eyes

318
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:24,538
and be struck
by lightning for three years?

319
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:29,474
The Crown Prince's
suggestion sounds good.

320
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:33,523
The Celestial Consort did say that
the mortal pushed her by accident.

321
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:37,093
We shouldn't be too harsh on her.

322
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,428
Yes.

323
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:41,009
Indeed. Three years of
lightning torment is harsh enough.

324
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,204
The Crown Prince's suggestion is just.

325
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,445
The Crown Prince is wise!

326
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,226
All right.

327
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:52,174
That is just fine.

328
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,371
Heavenly Lord.

329
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,373
Su Su once saved my life.

330
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:05,117
You've taught me that one who doesn't
repay the kindness one receives

331
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:06,489
isn't a truly righteous man.

332
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:09,709
Su Su was only brought to
the Celestial Palace because of me.

333
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,759
Now that such an accident has occurred

334
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,333
I should bear the consequences.

335
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:18,898
Moreover, she is now carrying my child.

336
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:25,678
Hence...

337
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:30,535
I ask for your permission to take

338
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:33,516
the three years of lightning torment
in her stead.

339
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:40,386
You wish to take on three years
of lightning torment for her?

340
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:41,440
Exactly.

341
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,695
This is to repay her kindness.

342
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:47,339
It's also for the sake of my child.

343
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,815
All right.

344
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,707
I will agree to it.

345
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:54,009
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

346
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:57,336
I will have her eyes taken out today.

347
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,848
The Medicine King will have
those eyes implanted into Su Jin.

348
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,895
Head over to Jade Manor.

349
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,589
Be prepared to take on
the lightning torment.

350
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:08,730
Lord Pu Hua is righteous and just.

351
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:14,009
He won't be lenient just
because you're the Crown Prince.

352
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:16,921
Bear this in mind.

353
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:18,801
Three years...

354
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,088
Not even one day less.

355
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,463
I understand.

356
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:31,547
I still have one last favor
to ask of the Heavenly Lord.

357
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:38,359
Please allow me to remove
Su Su eyes personally.

358
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,410
What?

359
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:42,097
You want to do it?

360
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,394
Since you insist on doing it...

361
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:54,971
I will allow it.

362
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,705
I'll abide by your decree.

363
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,771
Is my mistress all right?

364
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,897
She is fine.

365
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,058
Fortunately, the little prince is fine.

366
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:17,260
Lady Su Su is also doing well.

367
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,717
That's good.

368
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:53,172
Ye Hua.

369
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,509
- Greetings, Crown Prince.
- Ye Hua.

370
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,519
Believe me.

371
00:27:58,684 --> 00:27:59,868
Step out.

372
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,292
Yes.

373
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:26,526
Ye Hua, you do believe me, don't you?

374
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,635
You know that I didn't push her.

375
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,916
I would never push her.

376
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,997
You believe me.
That's why you've come to see me.

377
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,357
Am I right?

378
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,903
I believe you.

379
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,136
You didn't push her.

380
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:47,161
She jumped down by herself.

381
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:57,098
However, Su Jin's eyes were burned
and she's now blind.

382
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,184
The only way to spare you from death...

383
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:12,468
Is to take your eyes out
to replace hers.

384
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:19,932
Only then will the Heavenly Lord
be appeased.

385
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,117
Why?

386
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,858
Why?

387
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:51,492
Why would you say such words?

388
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,660
Don't you believe me, Ye Hua?

389
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,159
Why?

390
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,976
Don't come near me!

391
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:05,339
Su Su...

392
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,325
This is all my fault.

393
00:30:07,325 --> 00:30:08,699
I didn't push her!

394
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:10,046
It's my fault.

395
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:12,820
I can't protect you...

396
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,338
Su Su...

397
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:15,630
I didn't...

398
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,905
Su Su...

399
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,050
I will marry you.

400
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:27,307
From now on, I will be your eyes.

401
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,671
Ye Hua, don't do this.

402
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:33,035
Ye Hua, don't do this to me...

403
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,122
Don't...

404
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,971
Don't...

405
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,372
Don't do this, Ye Hua...

406
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:52,833
<i>[The Hall of Beautiful Youth]</i>

407
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:19,008
Don't...

408
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,823
My eyes...

409
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,520
My eyes!

410
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:34,644
My eyes!

411
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:40,604
My eyes...
My eyes...

412
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:52,873
Lady Su Su!

413
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:55,202
The Medicine King said that
you mustn't get too agitated!

414
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,858
As long... As long as you
recuperate for some time

415
00:31:57,858 --> 00:32:01,343
you will get better.

416
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,560
I will get better?

417
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,914
Will I get better?

418
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:07,710
Tell me.

419
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,410
What can I do to get better?

420
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,525
My eyes are gone...

421
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:16,180
How will I get better?

422
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,790
I've lost my eyes...

423
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,472
Crown Prince!

424
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,724
Crown Prince.

425
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,132
I am here to receive
the lightning torment.

426
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:44,163
Sure.

427
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,695
Three years in total.

428
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,882
49 lightning strikes each day.

429
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,549
Not one fewer.

430
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:55,116
The lightning won't harm you.

431
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:57,884
However, every strike of lightning
upon your body

432
00:32:57,884 --> 00:33:00,652
will hurt as if your soul
is being torn apart.

433
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:04,375
Many deities passed out
from such pain right here.

434
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,500
Your Highness.

435
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,414
Would you like the others to leave?

436
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:10,542
That's not necessary.

437
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,931
All right.

438
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:15,727
Crown Prince.

439
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,309
Please get on the platform.

440
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,706
Crown Prince.

441
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:16,168
My apologies.

442
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:17,454
<i>It wasn't me! She jumped off!</i>

443
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,389
<i>It had nothing to do with me!</i>

444
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,731
<i>Why don't you believe me?</i>

445
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,702
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

446
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,958
<i>Why am I the one
to pay the price for it?</i>

447
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:37,652
Step out.

448
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:38,724
Yes.

449
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:03,492
Uncle Lian Song.

450
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,809
Do you think that I'm qualified
to be given

451
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:08,925
the Crown Prince's Seal after
the battle in the Far North?

452
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,949
You have contributed to
defeating the Mermaid Clan

453
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,630
and pacifying the rebels
in the Far North.

454
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,898
Your reputation is widely known
in all realms and lands.

455
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:17,347
It's about time the Heavenly Lord
gives the seal to you.

456
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,409
However, you're now wounded.

457
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,405
If given the Crown Prince's Seal

458
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,427
you must be tested with 36 bursts
of sacred blaze

459
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:25,210
and 9 holy lightning strikes.

460
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,719
I'm worried that you might not survive.

461
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,916
Do I appear to be that weak to you?

462
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,704
Since I was appointed the apparent heir

463
00:36:35,704 --> 00:36:38,195
how am I to have all realms obey me
if I can't even survive

464
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,235
36 bursts of sacred blaze
and 9 holy lightning strikes?

465
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:43,135
I'll be honest with you.

466
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:46,001
You were severely wounded
in the Chang Sea.

467
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,967
This test will be tough for you.

468
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,641
It matters not.

469
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:54,704
Why are you so anxious?
Can't you wait for a while?

470
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:59,614
I had thought that by staying away from
the Hall of Beautiful Youth

471
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:03,130
and pretending not to care
about her when others are around

472
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,766
that I would be able to keep her alive.

473
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,179
Hence, I didn't dare to marry her.

474
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,875
I just wanted her
to give birth to our child

475
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,936
and then send her back
to the Mortal Realm safely.

476
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,398
However, I came to my senses today.

477
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,340
I was wrong to think that.

478
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,364
I was so terribly wrong.

479
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,744
No matter what I do...

480
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:31,739
the Heavenly Lord will have her killed.

481
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,846
You're right.

482
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,965
The Heavenly Lord got scared after
what my second brother did.

483
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,181
He doesn't dare take any risk.

484
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:42,264
After all, you're the Crown Prince.

485
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,590
You matter even more to
the Celestial Tribe than Sang Ji.

486
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,677
Therefore...

487
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:48,721
Once I'm given the Crown Prince's Seal

488
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:50,574
I will officially become
the apparent heir.

489
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:53,244
By then, I won't have to worry
about anyone else.

490
00:37:53,244 --> 00:37:55,876
I can then marry Su Su as my consort.

491
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,730
You're going to marry her
in the Celestial Palace?

492
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,213
Exactly.

493
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:03,773
I will announce it to
all six realms and lands.

494
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,463
She is to be my side consort!

495
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:09,492
I'm begging you, Your Highness!

496
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,606
I don't want to leave
the Hall of Beautiful Youth!

497
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,436
I don't want to leave!

498
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,382
The Heavenly Lord
has had all celestial maids

499
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:22,237
who witnessed this accident
removed from the Celestial Palace.

500
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:25,927
It was done to cover up
such a shameful scandal

501
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:28,275
so it will not be an embarrassment
to the Celestial Tribe.

502
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:30,605
My mistress is due any moment now.

503
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:32,454
And now she has lost her eyes!

504
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:36,920
No one else in the Nine Heavens
can look after her.

505
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:41,833
Please allow me to stay in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth!

506
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,802
Let me stay until my mistress
delivers her baby.

507
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:47,931
I'm begging you, Your Highness!

508
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,880
Who would have known

509
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,635
that there was such a loyal servant
in the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

510
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,264
Listen up.

511
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,396
Once you get to Deity Mountain
in the Lower Realm

512
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,751
you have to bury this accident
deep in your heart.

513
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,114
Not a word is to be said.

514
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:21,409
Have you all kept that in mind?

515
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,030
We understand.

516
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,224
<i>Why are so many celestial maids
being dismissed?</i>

517
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:39,103
<i>Has something serious happened?</i>

518
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:48,347
A serious matter? Indeed.

519
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:53,036
It's said that the Crown Prince's mortal,
Su Su, had a conflict with Su Jin.

520
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:55,784
She pushed Su Jin off Zhuxian Terrace.

521
00:39:55,784 --> 00:40:01,811
The Crown Prince later removed
Su Su's eyes to replace Su Jin's.

522
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:05,400
Why would the Crown Prince
do that to Su Su?

523
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,704
The Heavenly Lord intends
to cover up this accident.

524
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:12,030
Therefore, he's sent all maids and guards

525
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,355
who witnessed the accident
to the Lower Realm.

526
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:16,626
The ones you saw
should be the last batch.

527
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:18,869
Why would he cover this up?

528
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:22,516
I'm not sure about the details.

529
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:24,934
However, Dong Hua did say that
the Hall of Beautiful Youth

530
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:28,449
is now the most scandalous place
in the Nine Heavens.

531
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:32,315
Nothing could escape the eyes
of old Lord Dong Hua.

532
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:36,525
Little Princess, where are you going?

533
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,849
This is bad.

534
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:41,259
Could she be going to
the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

535
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:10,630
Who is it?

536
00:41:12,632 --> 00:41:15,027
<i>It's me. Don't you recognize me anymore?</i>

537
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:20,405
Little fox?

538
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:23,528
<i>You've been so cautious here
in the Celestial Palace.</i>

539
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:27,092
<i>You were nice to everyone
for the sake of that Crown Prince.</i>

540
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:29,422
<i>How could you possibly push
Su Jin off Zhuxian Terrace?</i>

541
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:36,405
Have you come to visit me
because you know that I've lost my eyes?

542
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:46,324
Do you know that in the Nine Heavens
he was once my one and only?

543
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,793
I keep thinking that
after I give birth to our child

544
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:56,492
we can go and watch the billows
of the Ten-mile Sea of Clouds together.

545
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:58,945
Watch as rays of sunlight
come shining through.

546
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:04,449
However, I've now lost my eyes.

547
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:06,237
What can I still see?

548
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,971
Little fox?

549
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:38,443
Your eyesight means nothing to him.

550
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,588
Su Jin?
