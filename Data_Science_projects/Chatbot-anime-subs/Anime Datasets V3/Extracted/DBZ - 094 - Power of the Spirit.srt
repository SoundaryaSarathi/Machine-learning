''The Incredible Destructive Force of the
Genki Dama!! Who Will Survive!?''

2
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,280
All of you sneaking around like this,
you're like pestering flies!

3
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,230
Aren't you done yet, Son Goku!? Haven't
you completed the Genki Dama yet!?

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,730
That Freeza creep is quite
thoroughly pissed off!

5
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,800
I- it's no good! This is still going
to take some time!

6
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,910
Shoot it! Shoot it, already!

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
I- it's no use...Just a little longer...

8
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,740
For someone too stubborn to die...Are
you still hanging around here?

9
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,900
I'll show you the power of someone
too stubborn to die!

10
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,900
Piccolo-san...

11
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,570
Piccolo may be intent on dying.

12
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,250
He probably used up the greater part of
his power in that blindside attack.

13
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,470
He's risking his own life to buy time for
Goku to finish the Genki Dama!

14
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,260
Piccolo-san!

15
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,600
Wait, Gohan!

16
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,950
Goku, please hurry!

17
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
That was useless.

18
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,890
Didn't you get it when I told
you it was useless?

19
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,230
Apparently, you wish to die early.

20
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,910
Goku! Hurry...hurry and complete
the Genki Dama!

21
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,580
Piccolo...

22
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,920
Piccolo...

23
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,580
-Tenshinhan... -These guys pushed Vegeta
around like he was a baby! Be careful!

24
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,230
Here goes!

25
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,440
Oh, look out!

26
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,930
Save me!

27
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,950
You guys,

28
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Attack! Attack, I say!

29
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,290
That's easy for you to say!

30
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,900
They're even...stronger...guys than ...Vegeta was!

31
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,310
Dammit, I'll do it!

32
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,650
What?

33
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,430
You're weaker than we thought, aren't you!?

34
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,270
What!?

35
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,470
We can win this!

36
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,270
All right, me too!

37
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,520
I get it! It's not that they're weak, it's
that we're strong!

38
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,950
This is the result of our training! The fruits of having
received Kaio-sama's judicious training!

39
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,790
They're better than I thought.

40
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,960
Hey, if we get serious, they'll be no problem!

41
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,310
Hey, ReaCoom, shake it off!

42
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,300
Nice! This is how it ought to be!

43
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,990
I am totally up for this!

44
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,930
ReaCoom Body Attack!!

45
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,920
All right...!

46
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,600
Hey!

47
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,950
Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma, Jheese!

48
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:41,280
Ginyu Special Corps' Blue Hurricane, Butta!

49
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,910
Now!

50
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,930
Goku, isn't the Genki Dama ready yet?

51
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,750
Still longer, Goku? I've just about
reached my limit.

52
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,420
Just a little longer...

53
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,790
Just a little longer, and it will beat Freeza...

54
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,770
As you wish, I'll kill you first.

55
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,420
Those guys, they scraped that together
with what little Ki they had left!

56
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,330
That there should still be some flies
there that had not run away...

57
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,030
You folks really are good at
annoying someone...

58
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,320
This is as far as it goes! I'm going to
trash you, along with the whole planet!

59
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,770
Goku! Still not yet!?

60
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,850
Okay, it's finished!

61
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,760
Do it, Goku!

62
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,100
Father!

63
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,380
O- oh, crap!

64
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,060
Get down!

65
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,070
I- I'll just take this and...

66
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,320
I- I'll just take this and...

67
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,750
I'll take this and...

68
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,760
I'll take this and...

69
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,820
Oh, what's this!?

70
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:26,740
H- he did it! Goku beat Freeza...
He beat Freeza!!

71
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,370
Yeah, he really beat Freeza!
He did it! He did it!

72
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
-He beat him!
-Goku did it!

73
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,770
Has Freeza-sama lost?

74
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,850
I- impossible!

75
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,340
It's a lie!

76
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,160
Goku has won!

77
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,460
He did it!

78
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,910
Kuririn-san!

79
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,910
Yo! You all right?

80
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,910
Y-yes!

81
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
It's all completely changed.

82
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,360
Yeah.

83
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,360
Where's father?

84
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,360
Where's Uncle Piccolo?

85
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,980
The super-giant Genki Dama finally detonates!
Has Freeza really been laid to rest?

86
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,400
And what of Goku? What of Piccolo?

87
