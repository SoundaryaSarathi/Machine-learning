[Ash] Pokémon Shipwreck

20
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,393
[Jenny] At first, we thought all the
passengers had gotten safely off the ship,

21
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,604
but we have just discovered
that five people are missing,

22
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,108
Ash, Misty, Brock, Jessie and James.

23
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,112
It makes all of us sad to think
that these young Pokémon trainers

24
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,324
have had their promising careers
cut tragically short.

25
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,578
May these flowers honor your memory.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,499

[Misty] Wake up, Ash. Wake up.

[Pikachu] Pika-pi!

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,194
[moans] What?

32
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,156
Hey, are you feeling okay, Ash?

-Pikachu?
-What?

34
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,038
Oh, brother. What are you
talking about, am I feeling okay?

35
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,123
You guys are the ones who are upside down.

36
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,584
You're definitely the one upside down.

37
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,336
Huh? [groans]

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,172
-Whoa!
-Look out!

00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,842
-Pika. Pikachu.
-[Ash groans]

40
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,762
Will someone tell me
what in the world happened?

41
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,223
Just take a look out the window.

00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,768
Huh? Huh? Fish swimming?

43
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,311
This can't be.

44
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,648
But that must mean

45
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,401
that this ship has sunk.

46
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,626
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,212
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

48
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,506
[both]
To denounce the evils of truth and love,

49
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,134
to extend our reach to the stars above.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,720
-Ah, Jessie.
-James with a perfect tan.

51
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,389
There's nothing like a tropical vacation.

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,808
-The blue sea.
-The white sand.

53
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,644
-And the blazing sun above.
-Ah! The sun.

54
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,188
Yes, that blazing sun,

55
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,315
fiery and burning,

56
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,068
and burning, burning.

57
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,611
Burning.

58
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,530
Something's really burning!

59
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,867

-Huh?

[both sighing]

62
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,421
Why is everything upside down?

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,924
The ship capsized and sank
while you two were sleeping.

64
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,217
-What?
-Aah!

65
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,636
We've got to abandon ship immediately!

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,099
I'm afraid it won't be so easy
to get off while the ship's underwater.

67
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,560
The ship's sunk! We're doomed!

68
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,353
Calm down, James!

69
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,315
I've already thought of a way
to get us out of here.

70
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,817
Ekans!

71
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,905
Ekans!
[rattling]

72
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,907
Ekans, acid.

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,367
Open a hole in the floor.
We'll use it to escape.

74
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,036
Wait! Don't do that!

75
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,208

00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,253
Didn't I tell you numskulls we're sinking?

78
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,422
You think we need another hole
on this ship?

[both gurgling]

81
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,347
What are we supposed to do?
The ship's leaking everywhere.

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,932
We've got to keep calm.

83
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,227
As long as there's air in here,
it'll take time to fill up with water.

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,063
Sure, but we better not waste any time
escaping.

85
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,816
Well, we can either go up or down.

86
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,069
Well, if we're sinking,
then up would definitely be better

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,989
-and if the ship is flipped upside down...
-The deck is below us

88
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,367
and the ship's bottom is
up above our heads.

89
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,410
Then we have to dive down to the deck.

90
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,120
Pika, pika.

91
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,332
But if we dive down to the deck
and come across a dead end,

92
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,584
-then we're done for.

95

[grunts]
So how are we supposed to know?

96
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,723
Water's my specialty.

97
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,060
Go, Goldeen!

98
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,398
Goldeen, Goldeen. Goldeen.

99
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,608
Goldeen, dive down to the deck.

100
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,362
If you find a way off the ship,
bring something back from outside.

101
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,115
Goldeen.

102
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,957
Goldeen. Goldeen?

103
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,841
What's taking Goldeen so long?

104
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,135
I guess it can't find a way out.

They look terrible!

109
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,608
Prepare. Prepare for trouble.

110
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,818
Yes, make it double.

111
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,070
[both] Huh? You!

112
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,281
We've got you brats cornered.

113
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,242
So you followed us
all the way to the bottom of the sea.

114
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,203
-Ekans!
-Koffing!

115
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,538
-Koffing.
-Ekans.

116
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,914
[both] Here we go!

117
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,169
-Bulbasaur!
-Char! Char!

118
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,379
-Squirtle! Squirt!
-Geodude!

119
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,714
All right, a match.

00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,724
The ship will roll
if we don't do something quick.

Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Geodude,
Koffing, Ekans,

125
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,104

Geodude, come back to this side!

[all screaming]

134
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,131
You guys, call back your Pokémon.

135
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,926
But Team Rocket will beat us
if we call our Pokémon back.

136
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,927
He's right.

137
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,472
We can't worry about that right now.
We've got worse troubles.

138
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,890
[both] Yeah.

139
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,105
Call your Pokémon back too.

140
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,774
What's more important,
a Pokémon battle or your life?

141
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,776
She's right. Good point.

142
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,616
[all sigh]

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,245
Okay, then, we all agree
there won't be any battles for now.

144
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
Let's work together.

145
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,331
[all grumbling]

146
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,916
Come on, now. Shake hands!

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,086
[all] Huh?

148
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,715
This is just a temporary truce
until we get out of this mess.

149
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,799
Better believe it.

150
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,010
[both grunt]

[groans]

155
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,685
It's agreed we work together.

156
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,104
Now we gotta think of some way to escape.

157
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,899
Leave it to me. I forgot to mention
I built my own <i>St. Anne </i>once.

158
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,026
-[Ash] Huh?
-Really?

159
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,152
It was a model.

160
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,153
-[all] Ah.
-Oh, great.

161
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,114
That's how I learned
all about the structure of the St. Anne.

162
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,241
Since the way to the deck is blocked,

163
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,326
we'll have to climb
to the bottom of the ship.

164
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,079
We can cut a hole in the hull.
That's how we'll escape.

165
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,080
[all] What?

166
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,540
Well, at least it's a plan anyway.

167
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,752
[Brock] Over there.

168
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,547
Onix! Make a staircase!

169
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,010
[growling]

170
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,680
-[Brock] Let's hurry!
-[Ash] Right.

171
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,681
[Pikachu] Pika.

172
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,891
Let's move it or lose it.

173
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,851
[both] Yes, ma'am.

174
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,109
[Brock]
The lights are out. I can't see anything.

175
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,527
[Ash] Let me handle it.

176
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,530
Charmander, I choose you.

177
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,033
Char! Char!

178
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,745
So where does this hall lead to?

179
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,122
This corridor leads
straight to the engine room.

180
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,333
And that's where the hull is the thinnest.

181
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,169
With a little luck,
we should be able to cut our way through.

182
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,422
[all gasp]

183
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,301
This is no good.

184
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,553
It's impossible to cross
to the engine room.

185
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,722
-Jessica?
-Yes, James?

186
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,768
Whoever said beauty doesn't last
must have been thinking of us.

187
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,521
I'll always remember
what a wonderful dresser you were.

188
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,730
So will I.

189
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,315
Will you two knock it off?

190
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,901
There's gotta be some way
to get off this ship!

191
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,487
There must be some angle
we haven't thought of yet.

192
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,949
Think, Ash.

193
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,118
Pikachu, give my brain a jump start.

194
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,494
Pika.

195
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,913
[Ash groans]

196
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,790
Thanks. That's just what I needed.

197
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,627
Bulbasaur, I choose you!

198
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,714
Bulbasaur.

199
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,844
All right, Bulbasaur, vine whip.
Extend your whips to the other side.

200
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,179
Bulba.

201
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,641
Bulbasaur.

202
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,102
-Good job.
-That was a great idea, Ash.

203
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,396
Yeah, we can cross the vines
to the other side.

204
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,107
Let's get out of here.

205
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,654
[whimpers]

206
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,698
I can't cross that inferno.

207
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,326
Jessie and Meowth, you go ahead.
I'm staying here.

208
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,121
James, James, James!
Snap out of it!

209
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,832
How long do you think you'd last
on this side?

210
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,084
Now let's go. We'll cross together.

211
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,044
Oh, Jessie.

212
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
Please, don't abandon me.

213
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,173
Don't worry. I won't leave you.

214
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,926
-Hey, Team Rocket!
-[all] Huh?

215
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,052
Bulbasaur!

216
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,805
[all] Wait! Don't leave us!
Send back the vine!

217
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,726
[creaking]

218
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,937
[Team Rocket pant]

219
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,899
Now I know what
a toasted marshmallow feels like.

220
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,650
Hey, no time to take a break.

221
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,653
-We've got to get off this ship quick.
-Right.

222
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,947
Charmander, I choose you.

223
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,282
Char!

224
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,327
Charmander, we need you to weld
through the metal hull of the ship

225
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,537
-with your flame.
-Char! Char!

226
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,666
Mander!

227
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,293
[Misty] Okay, listen up.

228
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,379
Grab hold of a water Pokémon
and swim to the surface.

229
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,175
-Yeah, right. Got it, Ash?
-I'll be okay with my Squirtle.

230
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,595
Hey, don't forget about us.
What are we supposed to do?

231
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,889
Just grab a water Pokémon.

232
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,349
Water Pokémon?

233
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,351
It's almost burned through.

234
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,439
-[all scream]
-Are you crazy? What have you done?

235
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,360
Return, Charmander!

236
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,784
Now, let's go, Squirtle.

237
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,494
Squirtle! Squirt!

238
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,955
[Ash] Follow us, Team Rocket!

239
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,457
Hold on!
We haven't got the right Pokémon!

240
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,968
I hate water. Especially wet water.

241
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,886
We're in big trouble!

242
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,597
We can't escape without water Pokémon!

243
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,724
[James laughs]

244
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,725
You're laughing?

245
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,477
[laughs]

246
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,230
I don't see what's so funny, James.

247
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,400
The poor guy must be cracking up
just like the ship.

248
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,318
You really made fun of me.

249
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,320
But who's got the last laugh now?

250
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,324
Well, a true genius is never appreciated
until there's trouble.

251
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,327
I knew we'd need this in a tight spot.

252
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,413
Look.

253
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,289
-Hey.
-Could it be?

254
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,459
[both] Magikarp! We're not worthy.

255
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,753
Feast your eyes on the king of carp.

256
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,131
-Magikarp.
-You're the best, James.

257
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,507
I take back the jokes.

258
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,135
From now on, I'll treat you
with the respect you deserve.

259
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,220
Hmm. Better late than never.

260
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,514
It's time, Magikarp.

261
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,437
Magikarp.

262
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,441
Lucky for us I bought this,
even if it cost next month's salary.

263
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,068
Enough bragging. Just tie yourself on.

264
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,863
We got to escape.

265
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,741
All right, Magikarp, let's escape.

266
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:50,955
Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp.
Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp...

267
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,248
[all] Huh?

268
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,375
Don't tell me this fish can't swim.

269
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,502
Forget swim. It can barely splash.

270
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,297
We're doomed!

271
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,339
[all whimpering]

272
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,051
[all] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again!

273
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,113
I wonder why Team Rocket
still hasn't surfaced.

274
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,657
Do you think they're still trapped inside?

275
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,117
Pikachu?

276
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,829
There's nothing more we can do
except try to find some dry land.

277
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,122
[Ash] Let's see.

278
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,835
Nothing but ocean in every direction,
and no way to tell which direction to go.

279
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,339
I remember the story of Noah,
who, when he had to find dry land,

280
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,925
sent a bird to find it
and return with a branch.

281
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,054
What a great idea.
We're going to do the same thing as Noah.

282
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,682
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

283
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,017
[Pidgeotto screeching]

284
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,145
Pidgeotto,
bring us back whatever you find!

285
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,522
Pidgeotto!

286
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,942
-We're counting on you, Pidgeotto.
-Pikachu.

287
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,117
Huh?

288
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,122
Magikarp. Karp, Magikarp.
Karp, Magikarp. Karp, Magikarp. Karp...

289
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,875
Pidgeotto.

290
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,921
[Misty] They weren't able to make it.

291
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,507
[Ash]
Not even Team Rocket deserved this.

292
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,050
[Brock] Yeah.

293
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,219
I guess the only decent thing to do

294
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,514
is to give them
a traditional burial at sea.

295
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,269
That's right. It's our duty,
even if they were our enemies.

296
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,563
[grunting]

297
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,150
[all] Argh! Zombies!

298
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,153
-Who are you calling zombies?
-We are not zombies.

299
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,281
Somebody help! My fur's getting wet!

300
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,824
[groans]

301
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,826
Chu.

302
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:06,674
Karp, karp, karp. Karp, karp.
Karp, karp, karp. Karp, karp.

303
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,683
[stomachs rumbling]

304
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,643
I'm so hungry.

305
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,354
It seems like forever since we last ate.

306
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,857
If I'd known I was going to be starving,

307
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,027
I would've stuffed my face full
when I was on the St. Anne.

308
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,613
Oh, I want some food.

309
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,947
Stop it.

310
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,451
Yeah, that whining only makes you feel
even hungrier.

311
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,121
Karp, karp, karp. Magikarp...

312
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,125
Got to eat something,
like filleted carp.

313
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,543
Or fried carp.

314
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,338
Karp, karp, karp. Magikarp, karp.

315
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,299
-Fresh, marinated carp.
-Carp flambé.

316
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,509
Karp, Magikarp.

317
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,303
[all groan]

318
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,722
That's it! Dinner is now served!

319
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265

320
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,143
[screaming]

321
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,103
I wouldn't try that again if I was you.

322
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,315
Check your Pokédex
'cause Magikarp is just scales and bones.

323
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,651
I wish you'd told me that sooner.

324
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,780
Ugh! Not only can this fish not swim,
it's not even good for eating.

325
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,074
See, I told you buying it was stupid.

326
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,409
You good-for-nothing fish!

327
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,079
I don't want to be your master!

328
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,540
[grunting]

329
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,999
Karp, karp, karp...

330
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,126
Good riddance, Magikarp.

331
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,504
-I feel sorry for it.
-[all] Huh?

332
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,590
Karp, karp, karp!

333
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,016
[roaring]

334
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,352
[all scream]

335
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,021
-What is that?
-Now you've done it.

336
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,315
Magikarp has evolved into Gyarados.

337
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,777
Gyarados? I miss Magikarp.

338
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,112
[Pokédex] <i>Gyarados.</i>

339
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:55,324
<i>This Pokémon has a vicious temperament,</i>
<i>so use extreme caution.</i>

340
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,869
<i>Its fangs can crush stones</i>
<i>and its scales are harder than steel.</i>

341
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,789
I'm James, your master. Obey me.

342
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,957
[roars]

343
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,125
[whimpers]

344
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,920
Dimwit! If you're the master,
don't act like you're scared of it.

345
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,297
But I am scared.

346
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,216
Goldeen! Starmie! Staryu!

347
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,012
Goldeen.

348
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:26,897
-How will you battle it?
-My strategy is... run away!

349
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:32,069
[all] Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

350
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,487
[both pant]

351
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,072
[roars]

352
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,826
[all panting]

353
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,077
[roars]

354
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,997
[all] Faster! Faster!

355
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,836
[roars]

356
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,005
[all] Huh?

357
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,883
[Ash] What's it doing?

358
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,344
[Brock] It just evolved.
Maybe it's tired out.

359
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,511
[both] We made it!

360
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,221
Unless the stories are true.

361
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,139
[all] Huh?

362
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,099
What are you talking about, Misty?

363
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,810
Sailors tell terrible stories
about the Gyarados.

364
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,354
I think this might be...

365
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,356
It may be dragon rage.

366
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,607
[all]
Dragon rage?

367
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,110
[roaring]

368
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,618

369
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,952
[all roaring]

370
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,289
Help! We're Gyarados bait!

371
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,708
-We're doomed.
-Pikachu.

372
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,711
[all roaring]

373
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,338
Hey, what are they doing?

374
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,132
Dragon rage.
Gyarados' ultimate attack.

375
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,642
[all] Here it comes!

376
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,726
Let's go!

377
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,396
No one's ever gotten away
from dragon rage!

378
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,398
Whoa! This is it!

379
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:57,071
[all scream]

380
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:01,367
Hey, Brock! Misty! Pikachu!
Whatever happens, don't let go!

381
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,828
[grunting]

382
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,080
Pika!

00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,417
