1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:05,019
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,889
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,997
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:10,288
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:15,482
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:19,558
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:23,865
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,020
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,179
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,018
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,220
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,950
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:42,568
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,824
Let's go Appa! Come on, boy!

15
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:09,287
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us.

16
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:13,065
If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.

17
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,642
So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!

18
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:20,891
I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.

19
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,315
Please don't go, Aang.

20
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:28,681
The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.

21
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:35,358
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means.

22
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:42,437
I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.

23
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:47,416
We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

24
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:53,002
At least not without your friends. We got your back.

25
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:57,631
It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.

26
00:01:57,746 --> 00:02:01,855
You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown.

27
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,084
Good luck.

28
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,167
Thank you, for your...

29
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,244
Go!

30
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:19,201
Having trouble sleeping? Seen the Avatar lately?

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,857
Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!

32
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,619
Sailing into Fire Nation waters...

33
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:43,763
...of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,...

34
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,432
...this is the most foolish.

35
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,176
I have no choice, Uncle.

36
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:53,103
Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?!?!?

37
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:54,710
What if you're caught?

38
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:58,805
I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home.

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:06,106
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.

40
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:12,401
There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead!

41
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,222
Aang, we got trouble.

42
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:17,711
Yeah, and its gaining fast!

43
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:31,190
Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?

44
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:36,449
On my mark... Fire!

45
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,970
Fire ball!

46
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,837
I'm on it!

47
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:48,211
We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,410
Can't you make Appa go any faster?

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,661
Yeah, but there's just one little problem.

50
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:56,034
A blockade!

51
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:04,554
Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.

52
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,429
Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.

53
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:11,624
If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade.

54
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,991
It's the only way.

55
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,318
There's no time.

56
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,911
This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.

57
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,088
And that's exactly why we're here.

58
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,557
Let's run this blockade.

59
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,545
Appa! Yip! Yip!

60
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,843
He's not turning around.

61
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:33,598
Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do.

62
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:36,203
Do not follow the Avatar.

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,812
I'm sorry, Uncle. Run the blockade!

64
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:48,199
The Avatar... and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.

65
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,510
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

66
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,570
Shoot the Bison down, Captain.

67
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,740
But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?

68
00:04:56,854 --> 00:05:02,802
So be it. It belongs to a traitor. Ignite!

69
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,776
Launch!!!

70
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,118
Appa! Are you ok?

71
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,615
Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!

72
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,861
Do not stop this ship.

73
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,139
Launch!

74
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:16,362
Sokka...!

75
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,461
Ready...

76
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,360
Fire!

77
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,839
We made it!!!

78
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:10,249
We got into the Fire Nation... Great...

79
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,641
Where do you think the Avatar is headed, Sir?

80
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:19,214
I'm not sure. But I bet a certain banished prince will know.

81
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,549
We're on a collision course!

82
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:22,816
We can make it!

83
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,251
The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.

84
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:29,577
Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.

85
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,854
Sir?

86
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:58,537
There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!

87
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:05,657
You did it buddy. Nice flying.

88
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,963
Oh! You must be tired!

89
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:13,773
No. I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders.

90
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,112
I was talking to Appa.

91
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:20,116
Well, I was talking to Momo.

92
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,876
I don't see any guards.

93
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,664
The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.

94
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,506
Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.

95
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,368
Wait... I think I heard something.

96
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:53,873
We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

97
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,308
Great! I am the Avatar.

98
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,396
We know.

99
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,370
I'll hold them off. Run!

100
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:14,189
If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become.

101
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:17,833
Split up and find him!

102
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:20,954
Follow me!

103
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,534
Do you know where you're going?

104
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:23,817
Nope!

105
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,524
Wrong way!

106
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,693
Come back!

107
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:37,598
I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.

108
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:41,425
Firebenders aren't our friends.

109
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,614
I know why you're here, Avatar.

110
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:45,699
You do?

111
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:51,323
Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.

112
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:53,520
How?

113
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,671
This way.

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,283
Time is running out. Quickly!

115
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:16,322
What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

116
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:19,033
Because he wants to follow you.

117
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:24,126
He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after... the Avatar.

118
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:29,972
If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.

119
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,950
Avatar Roku once called this temple his home.

120
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:36,189
He formed these secret passages out of the magma.

121
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,888
Did you know Avatar Roku?

122
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:41,041
No. But my grandfather knew him.

123
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,708
Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me.

124
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:49,358
We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.

125
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,257
Is that how you knew I was coming?

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,591
A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred.

127
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:58,803
The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes... began to glow!

128
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:03,605
That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!

129
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:07,946
At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.

130
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:11,757
If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?

131
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,494
Things have changed. In the past, the Sages were loyal only to the Avatar.

132
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:22,627
When Roku died, the Sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return.

133
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,311
But he never came.

134
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:25,963
They were waiting for me.

135
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,055
Hey, don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late.

136
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:32,029
They lost hope the Avatar would ever return.

137
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,855
When Fire Lord Sozen began the war,...

138
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,202
...my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.

139
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:44,145
I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming,...

140
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,988
...I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.

141
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:50,533
Thank you for helping me.

142
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,479
We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.

143
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:58,429
Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue.

144
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:03,795
Only then will you be able to speak with him.

145
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,245
No!

146
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,553
Shyu, what's wrong?

147
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,909
The sanctuary doors, they're closed.

148
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,815
Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?

149
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:27,135
No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone.

150
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:33,850
Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.

151
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:40,403
Five fire blasts, huh? I think I can help you out.

152
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:48,421
Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.

153
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,730
This is a little trick I picked up from my father.

154
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,072
I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing,...

155
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:07,053
...Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!

156
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,565
You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.

157
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:14,079
This might actually work.

158
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:20,774
The Sages will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.

159
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,052
Its almost sunset. Are you ready?

160
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:25,185
Definitely.

161
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:43,383
They're still locked.

162
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:47,957
It didn't work.

163
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:59,777
Why won't it open! Aargh!

164
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,199
Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do.

165
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:06,848
I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing.

166
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,199
I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.

167
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,698
Sokka! You're a genius!

168
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:18,111
Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.

169
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,113
Come on Aang, let her dream.

170
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:26,563
You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work... but it looks like it did.

171
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,588
Did the definition of "genius" change in the last hundred years?

172
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:33,650
Come Quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.

173
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,058
How did he get in?

174
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:40,674
I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!

175
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:49,454
He's inside. Open the doors immediately before he contacts Avatar Roku.

176
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,790
It's the Avatar's lemur!

177
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:10,182
He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!

178
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,206
Now, Aang!

179
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,964
Aang! Now's your chance!

180
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:21,732
The Avatar's coming with me!

181
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,749
Close the doors! Quickly!

182
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,442
Go!

183
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,875
He made it!

184
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:03,019
The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?

185
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,921
Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!

186
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:16,113
It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

187
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:20,031
Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing!

188
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:26,232
All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!

189
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:38,688
It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?

190
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,947
Why did you help the Avatar?

191
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,577
Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty.

192
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,226
What a moving and heartfelt performance.

193
00:16:56,345 --> 00:17:01,865
I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.

194
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,664
Commander Zhao...

195
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:10,822
And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work.

196
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,727
Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.

197
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:20,080
You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.

198
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:27,011
No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.

199
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,652
I have something very important to tell you, Aang.

200
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:39,540
That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.

201
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:42,515
Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?

202
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:43,709
Yes.

203
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,058
What does it mean?

204
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:51,575
One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war.

205
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:56,131
He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power...

206
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,455
...and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.

207
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,669
So the comet made them stronger?

208
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:06,694
Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.

209
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,525
But that happened a hundred years ago.

210
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,010
What does the comet have to do with the war now?

211
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:16,424
Listen carefully. Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer.

212
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:24,256
And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.

213
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:30,068
If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world.

214
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:36,126
Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.

215
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:40,237
But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire.

216
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:44,625
Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice.

217
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:52,663
But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.

218
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:02,349
When those doors open, unleash all your fire power.

219
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:04,092
How's Aang going to make it out of this?

220
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,087
How're we going to make it out of this?

221
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,273
What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?

222
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:18,071
I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before.

223
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:24,726
The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways... for now.

224
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,269
But I won't be able to come back to the temple.

225
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:30,132
What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?

226
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:40,182
I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.

227
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:44,211
A great danger awaits you at the temple.

228
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:50,489
I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.

229
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:53,076
I'm ready.

230
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,904
Ready...

231
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:06,857
No! Aang!

232
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,890
Fire!

233
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,488
Avatar Roku!

234
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:32,177
Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!

235
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,719
Not without Aang!

236
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,493
We got your back.

237
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:07,631
Thanks. Where's Shyu?

238
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,907
I don't know.

239
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:41,317
No prince. No Avatar. Apparently the only thing I do have is five traitors.

240
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:44,166
But Commander, only Shyu helped the Avatar.

241
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,665
Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

242
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:54,582
As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!
