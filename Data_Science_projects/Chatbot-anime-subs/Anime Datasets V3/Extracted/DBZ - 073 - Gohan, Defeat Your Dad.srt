1
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:43,735
Jheese, how high is
my battle power now?

2
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,066
Yes, sir...

3
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:57,749
What's wrong?
Jheese, hurry up and tell me!

4
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:01,086
I- it's 23,000.

5
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,317
What's that?
I can't hear you!

6
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,858
23,000!

7
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,127
There, you hear that!?

8
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,201
Just 23,000! That's all!

9
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:27,646
Why?

10
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,774
W- why, you ask?

11
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,215
23,000?

12
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,215
You say it's just 23,000!?

13
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,395
That's my body there.

14
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,998
You see, unless your mind
and body are united,

15
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,067
you can't put out any great power!

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,333
Kuririn, Gohan,
you can beat this guy now!

17
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,080
I- impossible!

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,514
T- this is impossible!

19
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:11,089
I- it's true! We just might
be able to beat him like this!

20
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,357
Let's go, Gohan!

21
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,689
R- right!

22
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,859
Now, Gohan!

23
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,109
What's the matter, Gohan!?

24
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,701
Father...

25
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,881
Gohan!

26
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,249
What's the matter, Gohan?

27
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:47,950
I- I'm sorry. For a moment,
he seemed like he really was Father.

28
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:54,065
I- I know what you mean.
I feel the same way.

29
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:57,402
But that isn't Goku. It's Ginyu!

30
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:58,835
Got it?

31
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,074
<i>Gohan... Kuririn...</i>

32
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:05,076
Okay, it won't happen this time.

33
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,509
Here we go!

34
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,398
Jheese!

35
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:04,736
What are you doing?
Why don't you fight!?

36
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,071
Y- yes, sir!

37
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:08,406
Whoa!

38
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:11,569
You're going to face me!

39
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,416
<i>Vegeta!</i>

40
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:22,352
You mean that lousy Vegeta
is still around?

41
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,635
You expect such a wimpy
attack to hurt me?

42
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:56,154
W- why!? This body is supposed to
have a power greater than 180,000!

43
00:04:56,154 --> 00:05:00,191
Didn't you hear what Goku said before?

44
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,321
You can't use that body very well.

45
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,734
Why don't you just give up now?

46
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:16,407
G- give up? You expect me,
Ginyu-<i>sama</i> to give up!?

47
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,841
Don't be ridiculous!

48
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,419
<i>Kuririn... Gohan...</i>

49
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,090
For someone such as yourself to even
consider picking a fight with me...

50
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,081
...takes a lot of guts!

51
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,358
Babble as much as you want!

52
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:47,338
How did you manage
to hide yourself!?

53
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,375
There wasn't any reading
on my Scouter!

54
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,278
You guys rely too much
on your Scouters!

55
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,047
If you were to fight against
those guys from Earth,

56
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,481
you'd figure it out for yourself!

57
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,391
That is, assuming
you don't die here first!

58
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:09,427
Don't be ridiculous! The Ginyu Special
Corps is made up of only

59
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:13,064
the most super-elite
warriors in the universe!

60
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,166
There's no way a monkey
bastard such as you

61
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,658
could ever stand
a chance against me!

62
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:30,882
So you say, but you're
actually afraid of

63
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,418
my renewed battle power,
aren't you?

64
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,646
W- what?

65
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:40,358
Take a good, long look,
with your precious Scouter there.

66
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,028
Afraid, you say?

67
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,021
Me? Afraid of a battle power
such as yours, Vegeta?

68
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,037
I- impossible...

69
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,044
Dammit!

70
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,568
It's broken!

71
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,717
Do you really think
it was a malfunction?

72
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,385
W- why, you!

73
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,388
Every time I recover from
being near death, I grow stronger.

74
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,523
I've also overcome
the limits of ordinary Saiyans,

75
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:15,185
and I'm still getting stronger!

76
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,398
Actually, I've just now
realized something-

77
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:26,404
This growth in power is not just due
to some kind of gift that I have.

78
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,898
Which means, I must be getting
very close to becoming one myself!

79
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,174
A Super Saiyan!

80
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,351
W- what?

81
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,911
S- stop talking nonsense!

82
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:48,092
A Super Saiyan is the mightiest
of all warriors,

83
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,028
delighting in death and battle!

84
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,664
Kakarrot may not be cold-hearted
enough to become one,

85
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,032
but I'm different!

86
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,524
I- i- impossible!

87
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,736
Attaway, attaway!
We're really hitting our stride!

88
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:35,740
L- looks like we're going
to beat him, huh, Kuririn-<i>san</i>?

89
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,077
I- impossible! How can I,
Commander of the Ginyu Special Corps,

90
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:42,740
be beaten by these guys?

91
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,093
G- Goku,

92
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,428
Sure enough, it was useless
trying to stop you,

93
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:02,100
and now you've become tangled up
in things better left untouched.

94
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,440
Goku, soon you will realize the hidden
terror possessed by Freeza.

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,642
It's not too late, even now.

96
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:15,373
Depart from that planet
as quickly as you can!

97
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:54,048
I- if Dende... can just make
it to where they are...

98
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:18,109
You Namekians really
are very stubborn.

99
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:21,445
You have absolutely
no chance of winning.

100
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:25,882
I do not want to use
my energy needlessly.

101
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,046
Dende...

102
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:06,357
I wonder how much longer I will
be able to view Namek's scenery.

103
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:13,354
I hope it is until Dende
reaches the Earthlings.

104
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:31,212
W- when Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> dies,
the Dragon Balls will also disappear.

105
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:36,213
Before that happens, I have to hurry
and meet up with those people.

106
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,528
Oh, no!

107
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:55,663
Gohan!

108
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:12,350
This is strange.

109
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,686
It's like suddenly, it seems
like he's gotten much stronger.

110
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:18,022
Watch yourself, Gohan!

111
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,690
R- right!

112
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:26,697
Impressive. Looks like he's starting
to get used to my body.

113
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:29,367
This ain't good.

114
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,901
From here on out,

115
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:36,307
I'm not going to be pushed
around by rubbish like you guys!

116
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:40,368
Here it comes!
The Ginyu Special Corps'...

117
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:45,850
I haven't done this
by myself very much,

118
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,321
but there's got to be something
good for me to say here...

119
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:54,485
Oh well, maybe I'll just skip it
this time and leap right into battle.

120
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:01,594
I- I- I wasn't finished yet!

121
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:10,933
I won't be beaten
by that flimsy blast!

122
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,012
This one will be even harder!

123
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,844
Gohan! Get out of the way!

124
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,557
Goku!

125
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,633
F- Father...

126
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,301
Yow-ow-ow!

127
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:40,464
H- how did you manage
that in your condition!?

128
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:48,312
I- it's just like you're doing.
I'm starting to get used to this body.

129
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,143
I'm going to fight, too!

130
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,086
Y- you may have become
partially used to it,

131
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:59,323
but you still can't generate
its full power.

132
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:04,662
We've got to eliminate him,
before he completely masters my body.

133
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:07,331
With the three of us,
we can beat him!

134
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:08,332
Kuririn! Gohan!

135
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,334
Right, Father!

136
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,165
Y- yeah!

137
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:23,347
There's something strange
about this, huh?

138
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:27,017
I- I feel the same way.

139
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:33,183
I- it's a little odd to think that
I'm about to attack my own body like this.

140
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:56,177
Vegeta! There's no way we're going to be
beaten by a monkey bastard like you!

141
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,390
Babble on all you like!

142
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,851
It does not change the fact that
you are no longer a match for Vegeta-<i>sama</i>!

143
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:20,065
Now then, how about I show
you my true power?

144
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,545
S- s- spare me-

145
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,570
Vegeta! You didn't
have to go that far!

146
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:36,347
You just keep on spouting that soft-hearted
nonsense of yours, Kakarrot!

147
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,617
You'll never become a Super Saiyan!

148
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:42,286
I'm the only one who has that capacity!

149
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:45,585
What? You, a Super Saiyan?

150
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,160
Haven't you taken care of Ginyu yet?

151
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,632
All right then,
I'll dispose of him for you!

152
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:56,190
Move it!

153
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,665
I- incredible!

154
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,690
Now, to finish you off!

155
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,003
Why, you...

156
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:36,166
T- that's enough!
Don't kill him, Vegeta!

157
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,241
Die!!

158
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:48,352
<i>You fool!</i>

159
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:51,014
I- it can't be!

160
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:57,919
<i>Change!!</i>

161
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,759
What?

162
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:12,710
<i>Once again, Ginyu's signature technique,</i>
<i>the Body Change, bursts forth</i>.

163
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,374
<i>What is Ginyu's target</i>?
