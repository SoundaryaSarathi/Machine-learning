1
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,125
How audacious it was for them to attempt
to inflict even one injury upon me.

2
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:38,892
Such extreme examples of those
who did not keep their places.

3
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,136
Now then, Grand Elder-<i>san</i>,
it would appear that there is

4
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:50,540
still one foolish individual
out here who does not know his place.

5
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:58,149
I believe that if this gentleman
were about to be killed,

6
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,553
you would soon change
your mind and tell me

7
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:04,147
how to have the Dragon
Balls grant my wish.

8
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,661
You will also regret not
having spoken up sooner,

9
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,097
while you were still unharmed.

10
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:16,864
If you like, we can spare
your life right here and now.

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,773
You've probably already realized this,

12
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:25,231
but Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> has only
a short time left to live.

13
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,680
It would be bad for you and I both

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,118
if we were to fight here,
with him caught in the middle.

15
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:34,949
We will change our location.

16
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,295
I do not anticipate the extent
of our fight to be that great,

17
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:46,131
but very well.

18
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,395
Anywhere you like.

19
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:18,163
My apologies, Nail.
Please find a way to hold out

20
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:23,624
long enough for Dende to
reach the Earthlings.

21
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:32,536
At this point, the fate of our
planet rests in their hands.

22
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,181
C- Commander Ginyu!

23
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,433
What are you laughing about?

24
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,482
How can I <i>not</i> laugh about this?

25
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:14,085
I didn't think anyone could
be as strong as you.

26
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,087
So why laugh?

27
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:21,548
Because I'm happy to have found someone
much stronger than even I, Ginyu-<i>sama</i>.

28
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,204
Yes, yes! Such strength!

29
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,705
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

30
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,284
It's been quite a while since
I've been so happy!

31
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,809
I'm so glad to be alive!

32
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,996
W- what!?

33
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,109
Jheese...

34
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,633
Y- yes, sir.

35
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,117
S- so that's it!
Commander Ginyu...

36
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:58,122
Take care that you do
not drop my Scouter.

37
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,556
That's it, all right!

38
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,634
How far away are you going?

39
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,639
This is far enough!

40
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:27,678
There is no need to distance ourselves
any farther than this, is there?

41
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,551
I suppose not.

42
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,710
My, my. Those who wish to
die certainly account

43
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,113
for a large number
of this planet's inhabitants.

44
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,377
How troubling.

45
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:32,417
This is amazing! Your battle
power has risen to 42,000.

46
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:40,091
I see now. You certainly are quite
different from the other Namekians.

47
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:44,195
I am surprised. It is
a wonderful battle power.

48
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,099
You certainly live up to your
classification as a " warrior-type."

49
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,102
I wish you were among my ranks.

50
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:56,107
Well, shall I inform you of the
battle power rating which I possess,

51
00:06:56,107 --> 00:07:00,044
to use as a reference as
you begin your fight against me?

52
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,047
My battle power rating is...

53
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,051
530,000.

54
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:11,055
However, naturally I do not intend
to use my full power against you,

55
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,392
so you need not worry.

56
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,060
What!?

57
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,065
I know! What if I were to fight
using only my left hand for you?

58
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,364
That might make it more enjoyable.

59
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,472
Enough!

60
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,426
No, this will not do.
Here I stretched out my neck for you

61
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,430
so that you could not miss,
and this is all you have?

62
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,096
On the other hand, this is about
right for someone at 42,000.

63
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:19,379
Oh my, that was impolite of me.

64
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,924
I will return it to you.

65
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:38,509
You should not be straining
yourself so, should you?

66
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:46,346
I think it would be best for you
if you spoke, before you get killed.

67
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,442
This is a surprise!

68
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,112
You can regenerate?

69
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:18,116
Although, while you may be back in one
piece, your situation has not changed.

70
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:21,385
It appears that you cannot
regenerate your energy, as well.

71
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,047
Your battle power has dropped.

72
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,101
My, my. After having been
shown how mismatched you are,

73
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,137
you still wish to continue?

74
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:45,167
I have no idea what the people
of this planet must be thinking.

75
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:50,148
I will not allow you...

76
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:52,343
I will not allow you to...

77
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:11,102
W- what is this?
What is going on here, exactly?

78
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:16,199
Does this planet have something
personal against me, or something?

79
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,920
<i>This time, l've had it for sure!</i>

80
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,190
<i>Lucky! lf I can just</i>
<i>make it into that cave...</i>

81
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,326
<i>Just a little farther</i>...

82
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:52,208
I- I made it! I'm saved!

83
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:08,252
Huh? Have I been saved?

84
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,900
This is so mean of you!

85
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:36,120
This is it! This time for sure!

86
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,385
Farewell, everyone!

87
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,461
Yow!

88
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,176
What? What happened?

89
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:04,472
Here.

90
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,087
Stay back! You pervert, grabber,
idiot, monster, whatever you are!

91
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,055
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

92
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:19,362
G- Gohan-<i>kun</i>! T- then...

93
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:26,437
How could you, Bulma-<i>san</i>?

94
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:29,106
How terrible. There
wasn't even any warning-

95
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,776
What have the two of you
been up to?!

96
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:34,445
No sooner do you show up suddenly with
Vegeta and take the Dragon Ball away,

97
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,113
then you take off with
him to someplace else!

98
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:39,784
Now, I want to know
just what's going on!

99
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:43,120
Do you think you can just leave
a delicate lady unattended out here

100
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,123
in such a dangerous place,
and get away with it?!

101
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:51,062
B- b- but didn't we just
rescue you from that dinosaur?

102
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,065
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, at any rate,
we need the Dragon Radar!

103
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,734
If everything works out, we may still
be able to get our wish granted!

104
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:01,072
What's this? You still haven't
gotten our wish granted?

105
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,075
I saw from the Radar all seven Dragon
Balls had been gathered in one place.

106
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,243
I was sure you were the ones
who had gotten them together,

107
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,745
and I was on my way to meet you.

108
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,748
And now what do I hear?

109
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,685
Unbelievable. What sort of
goofing-off have you been up to?

110
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:18,756
G- goofing-off, she says.
Scratch, scratch...

111
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,883
Bulma-<i>san</i>, pardon me for a second.

112
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,764
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, I've got it.
It's that way!

113
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,767
Okay, we're off!

114
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,104
Hold on! Tell me
what's going on!

115
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,773
We're in a hurry right now,
so we'll explain later.

116
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,110
Bulma-<i>san</i>, please wait
for us back at that island.

117
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,116
Huh!? You've got to be kidding!
You expect me to walk back from here?

118
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,711
How can you?
This is so mean of you!

119
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:54,058
Oh yeah, Father has arrived!

120
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:59,394
R- really? How is he?
Has he gotten much stronger?

121
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,068
Gohan, let's hurry!

122
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,558
Right!

123
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,755
Son-<i>kun</i>, huh?

124
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:29,527
I didn't think he would turn
out as handsome as he did.

125
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:32,860
With Yamucha as my boyfriend,
all he and I have ever done is fight...

126
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,043
Maybe I blew it.

127
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,734
Wha- wha-

128
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,099
What are you doing?!

129
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:19,936
What the?

130
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:30,754
Y- you're not a...
Super Saiyan...

131
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:37,695
...b- but I've still taken a liking...
to that strong body of yours.

132
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,687
T- taken a liking?

133
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:02,478
S- sure enough, Commander Ginyu
is planning on doing <i>that</i>...

134
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:25,501
<i>Amazing! How was he able to find</i>
<i>that much power in his condition?</i>

135
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,754
H- here it comes...

136
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,848
<i>C</i>- <i>Change!!</i>

137
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:46,922
H- how come...
I'm... over... there?

138
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,297
I've made an exchange,
your body for mine.

139
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,165
Y- you did what?

140
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,173
Commander Ginyu!

141
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:05,709
Here's your Scouter.

142
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,046
All right, we're returning
to the ship.

143
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,716
Freeza-<i>sama</i> may be on
his way back, as well.

144
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,546
Yes, sir!

145
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,888
This body is even faster!

146
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,731
I... can't... move!

147
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:32,430
So this is the reason
why he injured himself...

148
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:44,207
Oh no! At this rate I, I mean,
he and Kuririn will meet up!

149
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,656
Dammit, not only am I
unfamiliar with this body,

150
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:56,760
but with this wound,
I can't fly so well.

151
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,164
<i>On top of that, if I manage to</i>
<i>safely get back to Earth,</i>

152
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>l'll probably just get</i>
<i>Chichi angry at me again.</i>

153
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,770
<i>L</i>- <i>look at the face l've got now!</i>

154
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,136
<i>l'm done for!</i>

155
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:22,786
<i>What's this? Goku and Ginyu</i>
<i>have exchanged bodies</i>!

156
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,890
<i>Flying toward Freeza's spaceship</i>
<i>in search of the Dragon Balls were</i>

157
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,795
<i>Gohan, Kuririn,</i>
<i>Vegeta, and Ginyu</i>!

158
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:39,167
<i>The battle revolving around the Dragon</i>
<i>Balls has taken yet another radical turn</i>!
