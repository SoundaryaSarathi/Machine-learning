1
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:07,829
Endymion... Mother... Usagi
has learned everything.

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,867
Kunzite! You won't always get
your way in this world!

3
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:19,604
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

5
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
Shikou kairo wa short
sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

6
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

7
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

8
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

9
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

10
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta no
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

13
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,391
Tuxedo Mask, where are you?

14
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,833
Usagi, wake up! Big news!

15
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,702
Tuxedo Mask, I love you!

16
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:13,239
Usagi, Sailor Venus and Artemis
found the entrance

17
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,476
that leads to the Dark
Kingdom's hideout!

18
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,068
What did you say?!

19
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:28,677
Usagi's Awakening!
A Message From the Distant Past

20
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,390
I finally found it!

21
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,430
Good work, Sailor Venus!

22
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:46,034
Here we go!

23
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,048
Is this...

24
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,887
Let's take a look!

25
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,896
Energy?!

26
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,275
I would love to welcome you ladies
to the Dark Kingdom,

27
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,611
but preparations to receive you
are not ready yet.

28
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,445
So I will take you somewhere
more fun.

29
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,783
Give me a break!

30
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:32,774
Supreme

31
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,555
Thunder!

32
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,562
Sailor Moon!

33
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,297
If you quietly hand over
the Silver Crystal,

34
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,499
I will let you live!

35
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm thinking the same, Kunzite!

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,428
If you tell me what you've done
with Tuxedo Mask,

37
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,167
I won't punish you!

38
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:55,541
What impudence!

39
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:59,746
I will send you to the chaotic world
of multiple dimensions!

40
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:02,044
Chaotic world of multiple dimensions?

41
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:06,853
It may be the primitive era in Africa
when dinosaurs roamed.

42
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,188
Or it could be the era in Europe

43
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,281
when fierce wars broke out.

44
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:17,455
I don't wanna be sent to a
messed-up world like that!

45
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:32,266
The Silver Crystal will be mine!

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,411
Damn!

47
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,528
Where are we?

48
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,932
These are the ruins of
Silver Millennium,

49
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,457
the land of gods that once attained
the pinnacle of glory.

50
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,732
Silver Millennium?

51
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:38,177
Who are...

52
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:42,181
I am here to bring you a message
from the distant past.

53
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:44,206
I am the incarnation of the
Moon Goddess, Serene.

54
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:49,188
I am the Queen of Silver Millennium,
Queen Serenity.

55
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:50,790
I am your mother.

56
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,554
What?! You're my mom?!

57
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,995
What do you mean by that?

58
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:59,932
I revived Luna and Artemis
from their cold sleep,

59
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,734
had them make contact with you

60
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,793
and watched over all of you.

61
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:18,405
We are long-living life forms
born on the moon.

62
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,888
Our mission is to protect the sacred
will passed down to us

63
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,990
on the moon, the legendary
Silver Crystal,

64
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,559
and to watch over and aid

65
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,017
the progression of Earth's evolution.

66
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:33,427
Remember, Serenity...

67
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:39,364
of the time when you were living
as the princess of the moon.

68
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:55,054
Serenity, you adored the
green trees and wind

69
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:59,252
of the beautiful blue Earth,
and often gazed up at it.

70
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,924
Then you found love.

71
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,031
Princess Serenity!

72
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:09,668
Prince Endymion!

73
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:13,139
Please pardon me for being
late to the ball.

74
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,874
I have been waiting for you.

75
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:16,909
Something terrible has happened.

76
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:17,710
What?

77
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,908
Most of us on Earth have been
brainwashed by Beryl.

78
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,011
Beryl?

79
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:30,179
Beryl has been possessed by
an evil energy called Metalia.

80
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,326
And now, she is taking advantage of

81
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,762
the humans' yearning for the
longevity of your people,

82
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:37,662
and getting ready to attack the moon!

83
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:39,997
Who's there?!

84
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,332
At the ball...

85
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,069
Endymion...

86
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:53,312
Where did everyone else go?!

87
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,480
Even if it's only us,

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,448
we have to find the Dark
Kingdom's hideout!

89
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,885
What is this place?!

90
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,364
The North Pole?!

91
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:23,667
Princess, may I?

92
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,819
Endymion.

93
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:41,494
There is no doubt that a bitter war
is about to break out

94
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:44,827
between your people and
us Earth people.

95
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,367
I will be your future enemy,

96
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,037
so it would be bad for my identity
to be known now.

97
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:52,937
So, please pardon my appearance.

98
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,234
You will be my enemy?

99
00:08:55,942 --> 00:09:00,276
Metalia is not a human being.
She is a mass of evil energy.

100
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,517
Beryl is a witch.

101
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,619
By using the power of Metalia,

102
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,349
she is trying to conquer
the moon and Earth.

103
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,233
If we do nothing, this moon
will be destroyed.

104
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:26,205
We must not waste a moment
in obliterating Metalia,

105
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,901
who possesses an enormous
amount of evil energy,

106
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,102
and crushing Beryl's ambitions!

107
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:35,442
I would like your help in this, Serenity.

108
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,941
Will you believe what I just told you?

109
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,382
Yes.

110
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,815
Serenity...

111
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:44,786
Endymion...

112
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,846
It's terrible! It's terrible!

113
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,371
The people of Earth are attacking us!

114
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,350
Bubble

115
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,431
Spray!

116
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,335
Fire

117
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:34,195
Soul!

118
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,270
Supreme

119
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,247
Thunder!

120
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:49,346
Crescent Beam!

121
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:13,134
Starting today, I will rule both
Earth and the moon!

122
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,916
I will not allow anyone to defy me!

123
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:23,116
Our beloved Metalia, this is the
birth of our Dark Kingdom!

124
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,471
So, you are Princess Serenity?

125
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,508
I will destroy that pretty face of yours!

126
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,154
Beryl, I will not forgive you

127
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,689
if you lay even a single finger
on the princess!

128
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,156
Endymion!

129
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:37,297
Why do you protect the
princess of the moon?

130
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,132
You are the prince of Earth.

131
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,634
If you just marry me,

132
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,004
you could be king of both
the moon and Earth!

133
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:46,740
Beryl, you are being misguided
by Metalia,

134
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,674
who possesses evil energy.

135
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:52,412
Wake up! Rid yourself of the evil mind!

136
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,939
Shut up! I will kill you, too!

137
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,826
Endymion!

138
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,297
Serenity!

139
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,026
Endymion!

140
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,391
Stay back!

141
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,793
Serenity!

142
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,683
Serenity!

143
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:44,528
Princess Serenity...

144
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,127
She's dead! The Moon
Princess is dead!

145
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:02,479
Serenity...

146
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,607
Queen Serenity, if you use the
Silver Crystal, your life...

147
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:32,704
My life is nothing compared to peace
on the moon and Earth.

148
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,982
Moon Healing Escalation!

149
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:40,149
What?!

150
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:46,452
Lady Metalia!

151
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,131
Lady Metalia!

152
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,175
Artemis, hang in there!

153
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:17,791
I'm fine. What about you, Luna?

154
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,785
No, I'm fine. I can't die until
we find their hideout!

155
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,464
This is...

156
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:32,038
We've found it!

157
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:35,098
Finally, we've found the entrance
to the Dark Kingdom's hideout!

158
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,508
We need to tell everyone right away!

159
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,977
But it is already too late.

160
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,084
Luna, Artemis...

161
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:54,694
Yes.

162
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,797
The Silver Crystal can be
used for peace

163
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:00,500
if it is used with the energy
of a good heart.

164
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,104
But, if it is used with the energy
of an evil heart,

165
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,504
it will become a terrible weapon.

166
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,333
Queen Serenity!

167
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:15,338
I have been able to seal Metalia
away with the Silver Crystal,

168
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:19,679
but there is no knowing when
she might be revived again.

169
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,990
And this Crescent Moon Wand

170
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,221
can only be used by a descendant
of this kingdom.

171
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:31,831
If Metalia should return to life
again in the future,

172
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:37,737
give this to Princess Serenity and
protect the peaceful world.

173
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:38,931
Yes, my lady.

174
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:44,109
Princess Serenity and all
of our sailor warriors,

175
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:48,944
may your love be fulfilled
in the future on Earth.

176
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,813
In the future on Earth...

177
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:27,518
...please live happy lives.

178
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,702
Queen Serenity!

179
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,190
We...

180
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:09,923
traveled...

181
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:11,725
into the past.

182
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:16,066
Now, we know why we're
Sailor Warriors.

183
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:17,728
Yes.

184
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,698
Mother...

185
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,434
Help!

186
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:29,048
Luna!

187
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:29,716
Artemis!
Luna!

188
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:30,239
Artemis!

189
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,179
Sailor...

190
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,756
I won't let you hurt them!

191
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:40,894
Sailor Moon?! It can't be!

192
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:43,563
I sent you to the chaotic world
of multiple dimensions!

193
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,699
You won't always get your way
in this world!

194
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:50,362
Thanks to you, we've recovered
our past memories!

195
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,005
So, we will...

196
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,473
thank you now!

197
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:54,667
Shut up!

198
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:58,077
Don't give me that sass! You're still
wet behind the ears!

199
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:02,377
Give back Tuxedo Mask...
no, Endymion!

200
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,919
I won't mind returning him to you

201
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,648
if you quietly hand over
the Silver Crystal.

202
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,127
Sailor Moon!

203
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,604
You're more sinister than I imagined!

204
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:26,071
I'll never forgive you!

205
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:28,508
We are inside my own space.

206
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,409
Will your attacks still work
against me, I wonder?

207
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:38,084
Everyone, we have to combine
our powers!

208
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,847
Protect Sailor Moon!

209
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,379
Venus Power!

210
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:45,992
Mercury Power!

211
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:48,228
Mars Power!

212
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,957
Jupiter Power!

213
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:03,769
Everyone!

214
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:12,079
Even if you repaid us with nicer
haute couture dresses,

215
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,917
I would never forgive you for
cutting up a girl's clothes!

216
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:19,615
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

217
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:32,568
Moon Healing Escalation!

218
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:46,145
I am one of the Great Four of
the Dark Kingdom, Kunzite!

219
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:50,145
On my pride, I will not yell, "Refresh!"

220
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,155
What?!

221
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:00,295
Impossible!

222
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:04,299
With my own weapon...

223
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:14,107
Zoisite, guide me to the world
where your soul is drifting!

224
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:26,090
Sailor Moon, that was
tremendous power.

225
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,221
She's different than usual.

226
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,096
Luna, please hang in there.

227
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:37,497
Usagi... No, Sailor Moon...

228
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:41,808
No, Serenity, the Dark
Kingdom's hideout

229
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,242
is at D-Point in the North Pole.

230
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:48,402
If you don't hurry, the sunspot
will expand!

231
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,917
We have no choice but to
launch a surprise attack!

232
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,909
Okay! We'll march into the
Dark Kingdom right away!

233
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,190
Right, everyone?!

234
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,350
Yes!

235
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,919
In the name of the moon,

236
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,063
we will punish you!

237
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:15,129
