00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,698
I was trying to hide Eevee from them,
just for today.

173
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,577
Then nobody could force me
to make it evolve at the party.

174
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,538
But Eevee looked very, very lonely
out there.

175
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,831
Chu.

176
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,542
I was going to go get it later.

177
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,626
[squeals]

178
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,006
I don't care if Eevee evolves or not.
I just want it to be my best friend.

179
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,215
That's great.

180
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,217
Huh? You think that's great?

181
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,262
-There's only one thing wrong.
-What's that?

182
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,097
You shouldn't have hidden Eevee.

183
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,641
You were just running away
from your problems.

184
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,601
Running away?

185
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,605
If you don't want Eevee to evolve,
tell your brothers how you feel.

186
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,815
That's your responsibility as a trainer.

187
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,485
But, hey, I'm not your mother or anything.

188
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,111
No. You're right.

189
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,531
Ha! I really should apologize to you.

190
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,158
If you hadn't claimed Eevee,

191
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,036
I was going to keep it
and change it into Vaporeon myself.

192
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,038
You were, Misty?

193
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,624
Pi, pika. Pikachu.

194
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,708
[squealing]

195
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,752
-Pika. Pikachu.
I wonder what they're saying.

196
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,755
A while ago,
Pikachu decided not to evolve.

197
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,714
Really?

198
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,633
Pika. Pikachu.

199
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,303
-You just don't get it, do you?
-We get it, all right.

200
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,639
We just don't evolve our Pokémon that way.

201
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,391
You like your way of evolving,
and we like ours.

202
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,060
That's the way to tell them, Brock.

203
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:06,648
Come on. Let's move on to the main event
so they can see evolution our way.

204
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,857
Good idea.

205
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,817
Mikey!

206
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,736
Have you decided on Eevee's evolution yet?

207
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,655
Uh... Uh... I'll, mm...

208
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,158
-Come right out and tell him, Mike.
-Uh... Uh...

209
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,244
Hmm...

210
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,791
Come on, Mikey.
Tell us what you decided.

211
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
Go ahead. Tell him, Mikey.
You can do it.

212
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,670
Pikachu.

213
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,547
[squeals]

214
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,632
Hmm.

215
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,468
-A Jolteon, right?
-A Flareon, right?

216
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,845
A Vaporeon.

217
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,097
Aw, you guys, I, uh...

218
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,306
[popping]

219
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,475
[all screaming]

220
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,728
[Jessie] It's show time, everybody.

221
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,439
[brother] Who invited you?

222
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,111
-Prepare for trouble.
-And make it double.

223
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,446
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation...

224
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,407
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation...

225
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,951
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

226
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
To extend our reach to the stars above...

227
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,539
-Jessie.
-James.

228
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,083
[munches] Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

229
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,627
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

230
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,045
That's delicious.

231
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,547
Keep your eyes open, guys.

232
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,924
Team Rocket will steal your Pokémon
if you're not careful.

233
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,385
[munches]
Weezing, spread a smokescreen.

234
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,137
Weezing.

235
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,432
[all coughing]

236
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,893
[brother] I can't see anything!

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,353
Pidgeotto, blow the smokescreen away.

238
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,646
Gust attack!

239
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,775
[screeching]

240
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,361
[all coughing]

241
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,739
-My Jolteon!
-Vaporeon!

242
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,698
Flareon!

243
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,159
-Where's Eevee?
-Pikachu!

244
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,369
Oh, no! My Horsea is gone!

245
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,622
Help! Help! My Poliwrath's gone!

246
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,582
The stones are gone!

247
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,542
All the food is gone too!

248
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,419
Those creeps took everything.

249
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,505
Team Rocket took the stones,
and they took the food too.

250
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,468
-Psy!
-Why couldn't they take you too?

251
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,428
The balloon! They're getting away!

252
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,431
Pidgeotto, attack that balloon!

253
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,641
[screeching]

254
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,187
You did it! Good work, Pidgeotto.

255
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,816
[all] Huh?

256
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,612
-It's empty.
-No.

257
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,323
Pidgeotto, go find Team Rocket.

258
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,282
[screeches]

259
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,993
[laughs] A piece of cake.

260
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,955
That was easier
than taking candy from a baby.

261
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,916
Candy and cold cuts and Pokémon too.

262
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,879
-We've outdone ourselves, James.
-Outdone ourselves, outsmarted them.

263
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:35,838
[laughs]

264
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,839
[squeaking]

265
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,222
[screeches]

266
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,815
Pika, pika. Pikachu!

267
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,652
[belches]

268
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,405
Ah, nothing tastes better
than a victory meal.

269
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:05,243
We've gotten beaten so many times,
I'd forgotten what victory tasted like.

270
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,202
Ooh!

271
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,121
I don't ever want you
to call us losers again.

272
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,834
From now on, we'll be known
as Team Rocket, champions of the world.

273
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,295
Champions of the entire world!

274
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,216
Why don't you two dry up?
It's time make that little one evolve.

275
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,218
[squeaking]

276
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,429
All right. Evolution time.

277
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,931
What we need
is a really evil-looking Pokémon.

278
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,309
That's why we need it to be a Jolteon.
Argh!

279
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,396
-Who said you get to decide?
-Yeah, who said?

280
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,148
I'll turn it into Flareon.

281
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,776
What? Wait a minute.
Vaporeon is so much more villainous.

282
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,945
Jolteon's the best of the worst!

283
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,322
Flareon and its passionate flames.

284
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,283
Cool Vaporeon!

285
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,245
-[Meowth] Jolteon is the best!
-[James] Vaporeon is much stronger!

286
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,580
[blows whistle]

287
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,750
Time out, Team Rocket. I've got an idea.

288
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,585
-Huh?
-What is it?

289
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,921
We'll use all three stones on Eevee
at the same time.

290
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,466
It's bound to evolve
into something really evil.

291
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,676
-All right. Sounds bad.
-Count me in!

292
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,635
[squeals]

293
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,887
Go!

294
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,890
-Squirtle, water gun attack now!
-[all] Huh?

295
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,183
Squirtle. Squirtle.

296
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,851
-Squirt!
-Psy!

297
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,063
[gargling]

298
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,064
Embarrassing.

299
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,524
[babbling]

300
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,986
-Psy!
-[Misty] Embarrassing is right.

301
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,448
Squirtle, it looks like it's up to you.

302
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,659
Squirt, Squirtle, squirt! Squirt!

303
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,119
[all gasp]

304
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,206
-Now let's go rescue the Pokémon.
-Yeah!

305
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,457
[Jessie] Not so fast.

306
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,917
Huh! Eevee!

307
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,337
How did you ever find us
all the way out here?

308
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,381
Yeah, it's the first time
we didn't mess up.

309
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,051
Well, you see, Horsea spit out
a trail of ink to show us the way.

310
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,845
-Pretty smart, huh?
-Horsea.

311
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,600
Unbelievable! That little squirt
screwed up our perfect plan.

312
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,977
I guess we'll just have to settle
for little Eevee.

313
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,939
Forget it, you old hag!
We won't let you do that!

314
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:02,443
What? What? What did you just call me?

315
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,904
[growling, then screaming]

316
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,074
Wow, Jessie just evolved into a Flareon!

317
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,368
-Ready for battle?
-[both] Okay.

318
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,953
[James] Weezing!

319
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,955
Weezing.

320
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,081
[Jessie] Arbok!

321
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,834
Arbok!

322
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,170
Attack, Arbok.
Show that puny little punk who's boss.

323
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,755
I'm not puny!

324
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,841
-Ready, Pikachu?
-Pika.

325
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,970
Wait. That's our brother's Eevee.
It's our job to save it.

326
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,597
-Let's go, Rainer, Pyro.
-[both] Yeah!

327
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,057
Brothers!

328
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,768
Watch the power of an evolved Pokémon!

329
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,729
-Jolteon, attack!
-Jolt!

330
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,357
-Vaporeon, attack!
-Por!

331
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,318
-Flareon, attack!
-Flare! Flare! Flare!

332
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:48,448
-Arbok, poison sting attack!
-Cha!

333
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,784
Jolteon, pin missile, fire!

334
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,203
[growls]

335
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,497
Ar!

336
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,292
-Weezing.
-Weezing, hit it with a sludge attack!

337
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,004
Vaporeon,
use your acid armor and fight back!

338
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,679
Weez, weezing.

339
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,682
[brother] Vaporeon, attack!

340
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,476
-Weez!
-Poreon!

341
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,644
[both screaming]

342
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,771
[Jessie] Run for it!

343
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,608
Don't let them get away!
Flareon, fire spin!

344
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,693
Flare! [growls]

345

-[all] Yeah!
-All right!

347
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,575
We beat you. Now, hand over the Eevee.

348
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,535
We're not finished.

349
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,745

354
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,047
So you thought you had us beat, did you?

355
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,924
We're the champion Team Rocket.

356
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,759
Champions?

357
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,968

[all gasping]

361
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,940
-We can't lose this battle to them.
-Especially on our first day as champions.

362
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,149
Let's get them!

363
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,276
-What?
-They still want to fight?

364
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,820
There's something different
about Team Rocket.

365
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,239
-Pika.
-[Eevee squeals]

366

-It's time to finish them off.
-Victory.

[growling]

373
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,921
All right, Eevee! Get ready!

374
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,923
It's time for our first real battle!

00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,885

Pikachu!

378
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,556

Victory?

386
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,117
It looks like champion Team Rocket...

387
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,579
[all] Is blasting off again!

390
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,003
-Eevee!
-Wow! You're the greatest, Eevee!

391
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,255
[laughs]

392
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,091
-You did it, Mikey.
-That was really cool.

393
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,135
-Beautiful.
-Pika, pika.

394
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,720
[brother] Mikey.

395
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,639
Winning your first battle by yourself,
that's incredible.

396
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,268
And you won without making Eevee evolve.
I was wrong.

397
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,187
You always said you didn't want to battle,
but you did great.

398
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,149
I just wanted to help everybody out.

399
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,115
Hey, you guys.
I've decided to become an Eevee trainer.

400
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,576
[all] Hmm?
-An Eevee trainer?

401
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,164
Well, Mikey, if that's what
you want to do, then do it.

402
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,375
If you felt that way about it,
you should have told us sooner.

403
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,753
Now we really are the four Eevee brothers.

404
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,713
My brothers are the best.

405
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,964
[squeals]

406
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,717
-Congratulations, Mikey.
-Thanks!

407
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,971
Hey, guys, let's make this party
a celebration of Eevee's first victory.

408
00:18:59,055 --> 00:18:59,930
[both] Mm-hm.

409
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,683
[all] Congratulations.

410
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,019
-You did it, Mikey.
-Yeah.

411
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
-Uh, Miss Misty?
-What is it?

412
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,025
I wanted to thank you for helping me.

413
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,236
-For you.
-Oh, it's beautiful, Mikey.

414
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,198
I'm sure you'll become
a great Eevee trainer.

415
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,909
-Friends forever?
-Friends forever.

416
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,912

[all] Mikey! Mikey! Mikey!

419
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,212
That's so sweet.
It must be nice to have big brothers.

420
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,339
You could pass for my brother.

No.
