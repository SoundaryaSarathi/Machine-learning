1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,062
I guess I’m hungry…

2
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:24,230
I’ll have to apologize to
Kero-chan for eating without him.

3
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,339
Time to eat!

4
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,878
Yum! It’s good!

5
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:33,505
I know…

6
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,310
I know all about it.
The truth.

7
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,786
Onii-chan’s voice?

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,390
So, there’s no more need to hide it.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,094
Onii-chan! And Yukito-san…

10
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,370
What you really are…

11
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:04,411
Onii-chan! You shouldn’t
be mean to Yukito-san!

12
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,905
– Sakura?!
– Sakura-chan?

13
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,205
CUT!!

14
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:13,583
What’s going on?

15
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,414
We’re making a movie.

16
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:16,719
A movie…

17
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:20,623
It’s for the cultural
festival at our school.

18
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:23,692
Oh! I didn’t know…

19
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,696
Well, let’s try that scene again

20
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,929
I’m sorry I got in the way.

21
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,164
I’ve got an idea

22
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:33,203
Hey, Sakura-chan

23
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,575
Yes?

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,839
Would you like to be in a movie

25
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,672
Y-yes!

26
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:50,413
[Sakura, Yukito,
and Disappearing Power]

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,829
You’re going to be in a movie?!!!!

28
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:01,866
Onii-chan’s class is doing it
for their cultural festival.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,966
Sakura-chan is finally
making her film debut!

30
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:07,799
It’s really only a small part…

31
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:12,441
I’m sure I’ll be awful, but Akizuki-san,
from Onii-chan’s class, insisted.

32
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,476
I’m positive you’ll do fine!

33
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,017
So, what’s your costume like?

34
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,482
They haven’t decided, yet…

35
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,452
I see…

36
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,192
Do you think they’d let me help?

37
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:26,517
I’ll ask them.

38
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,155
Thank you!

39
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,990
So, what’s the story like?

40
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:32,160
Wait a second ~~

41
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,631
I have the script right here…

42
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,266
Meitan te Saigo no Jiken
(The Famous Detective’s Last Case)

43
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:41,400
Is it a mystery?

44
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,010
Yes. It’s set in the past,

45
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,811
around the Taisho era.

46
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,575
Onii-chan is the hero,
Yukito-san is the villain,

47
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,052
and I’m Yukito-san’s little sister.

48
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,523
But, if it’s set in the Taisho era,

49
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:03,025
finding sets around here must be hard.

50
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:07,426
Onii-chan’s class has been looking,

51
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:10,034
but they haven’t had much
luck finding a house they could use.

52
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,639
What kind of house are they looking for?

53
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,371
One with a large yard and a balcony…

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,440
This could be good.

55
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,607
I’ll have to make arrangements.

56
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,310
But you really surprised me.

57
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:30,223
You never said anything
about the movie, Onii-chan.

58
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:33,587
He probably didn’t want
you to know about it.

59
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,357
Oh? Why?

60
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:37,629
More tea, please.

61
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:38,890
Ok.

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,134
Oh!

63
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:45,762
Wait a minute, ok?

64
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,535
– Nice trick!
– Quiet, you.

65
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:57,809
What’s wrong?

66
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,182
I’m a little tired, all of a sudden.

67
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,924
It’s ok. I always get tired after tea.

68
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:06,418
Yuki…

69
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,221
Things can’t stay this way.

70
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:17,663
I know… 
You…

71
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,237
Sorry for making you wait!

72
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:24,275
Ah, Sakura-chan.
Could I have some more tea as well?

73
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,074
Sure!

74
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:28,308
I’ll go get the cake.

75
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,146
Ok. Thank you.

76
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,012
Thanks.

77
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,083
You’re welcome!

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,723
Eh?

79
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,026
Is something wrong?

80
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,901
I must be imagining things…

81
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,879
What? You’ll let me film here?

82
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,616
I thought you’d say no, so I didn’t ask.

83
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:07,177
Consider it a gift for you, Ruby Moon.

84
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,621
Wow! Thank you!

85
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:14,557
However, I’d have thought you’d be
more suited to acting than directing.

86
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,656
But directing is the best!

87
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,134
I make the orders,
and everyone has to do

88
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:23,632
what I tell them! It’s so much fun!

89
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,030
I see.

90
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,974
Tomorrow everyone will be so happy!

91
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,942
Ok, back in a bit!

92
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,344
I’m sorry Spinnel.
You’ll have to stay out of sight.

93
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,445
I guess I can’t really avoid it, can I?

94
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,022
Is it really ok?

95
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,349
The new Card Mistress

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,354
may find out our secrets?

97
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,126
It’ll be alright,
if we watch what we say.

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,395
Sakura-san can be quite naive at times.

99
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,196
However, her brother is not.

100
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,969
He is very strong.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,811
I have a use for him.

102
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:15,222
As well as Yue’s other form.

103
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:18,557
How are things over there?

104
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,553
My, you’re slow! Hurry up! I want
to start shooting as soon as possible.

105
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:26,566
Are those props ready, yet?

106
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:27,959
Sorry! Not yet!

107
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,337
Well, hurry up, then. We’re going to
need that in a bit!

108
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,700
You over there! Keep it up!

109
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,680
Hello. Are you an actor, too?

110
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:44,351
N-No. I wouldn’t have come.

111
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,850
But Daidouji said…

112
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:50,821
She asked you here to cheer Sakura on?

113
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,023
Sakura will be wearing
traditional clothes, right?

114
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,196
They should look good on her.

115
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,098
I…

116
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,263
CUUUUUUTE!!!! Looks nice!

117
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:04,501
They look really good on you! Wow!

118
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,975
SAKURA-CHAAN!!

119
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,738
You look so cute!

120
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:18,049
I knew you’d be perfect for the part.
Thanks for coming!

121
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:20,154
I’ll do my best!

122
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:24,688
You look very nice.

123
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:26,759
Do I?

124
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,998
This is your debut, right?

125
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,502
Yes! I do this scene and one later on.

126
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,699
This is such a beautiful house!

127
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,839
It looks like it should be in a movie!

128
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:47,843
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,408
So, three of you live here?

130
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:51,542
Yes.

131
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,887
I wonder who lived here before.

132
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:58,489
Three foreigners,

133
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:00,583
just like us.

134
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:04,161
Sakura-chan looks cute, doesn’t she?

135
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:08,027
What’s wrong?

136
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:17,541
Nothing.

137
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:21,174
Tsukishiro-kun! Kinomoto-kun!
We need you now!

138
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:22,139
Ok!

139
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:23,851
We’re coming! Let’s go, Touya.

140
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,692
And this scene is…?

141
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,325
I told you before.

142
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,199
Weren’t you listening?

143
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,697
Listen this time.

144
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:41,625
Ok.

145
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,400
Calm down. You need to relax.

146
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,302
Relax?

147
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,044
Shall I fix your hair?

148
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:55,805
Sit here.

149
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:56,915
Thank you.

150
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:01,779
Eh?

151
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,984
I sense Clow-san’s aura from this chair

152
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,055
Is something wrong?

153
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,995
Oh? No… It’s a very nice chair.

154
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,033
It’s all I’ve had for a very long time.

155
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,137
Really?

156
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,737
Sakura-chan! We need you now!

157
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:27,572
Ok!

158
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,611
Sakura-chan’s right hand and
leg are moving in unison.

159
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,348
Is she really up to this?

160
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:37,885
Yuki?

161
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,983
Just a little tired.

162
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,722
And this early in the day, too… 
Strange, isn’t it?

163
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,934
And then you give this to
your big brother, ok?

164
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,560
And look really sad.

165
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:02,275
Cut!

166
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,847
Ok, that’s all for this one!
You were very cute!

167
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:10,481
Really?

168
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,760
Yeah! Ok, let’s do the next scene!

169
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:17,759
All done!

170
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,363
Are you really finished?

171
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:22,131
Yeah… 
But I was really awful…

172
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,998
No, you were amazing,
Sakura-chan!

173
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:30,171
And I was able to film “The Making
of Sakura-chan’s First Movie”, too!

174
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,909
I’m so happy!

175
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,108
Tomoyo-chan… 
You were filming the entire time?

176
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:37,917
Ok, here it is!

177
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,615
Everyone else will be done
after the veranda scene, right?

178
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:48,388
Ok, Tsukishiro-kun, you will run
out here. Touya-kun will follow.

179
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,587
Tsukishiro-kun will
gaze out over the landscape

180
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,760
and Touya-kun

181
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,964
will confront him.

182
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,132
Any questions?

183
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,698
Nope, none.

184
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,402
Okay, let’s go!

185
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,899
Hey, stop that, Akizuki

186
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:06,137
I can’t help it! I’m so excited!

187
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:07,641
Ok, it’s up to you!

188
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:11,877
You alright?

189
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:13,654
I’m fine.

190
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,288
Action!

191
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:21,724
They’re starting.

192
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,558
I’ll go get some tea.

193
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,254
Can I help?

194
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,697
No, I’ll be fine.

195
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,116
I know who the criminal is, now.

196
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:48,053
Who was it?

197
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,881
That’s perfect…

198
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:56,054
I know all about it… You…

199
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:59,525
That’s it!

200
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,400
You…

201
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:02,663
Yuki!!!

202
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:03,527
Yukito-san!!

203
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,007
Yuki! Yuki!!

204
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,275
Sakura-chan!

205
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:20,952
O Key that holds
the power of the stars,

206
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,253
Reveal your true form to me.

207
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:27,225
By our contract,
I, Sakura, command you!

208
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,324
Release!

209
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,710
Open your Eyes!!! Yuki!!

210
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,280
Yuukii!!

211
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:52,945
YUKI!!

212
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:07,995
Yuki!

213
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:19,709
Yuki…

214
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,038
We should put him in a room to rest.

215
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,543
You…

216
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,478
Don’t worry, it’s no bother.

217
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,462
Touya…

218
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,435
I guess I fell asleep, again…

219
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,666
Something like that.

220
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,505
So… tired.

221
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,579
Yuki, if this keeps up,
you’ll disappear.

222
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,379
I won’t allow that to happen.

223
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,383
Why will I disappear?

224
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:04,513
When you lose track of time…

225
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:10,356
I know all about it… You…

226
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:12,326
Tsukishiro-kun! Are you okay?

227
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,134
Again…?

228
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:17,194
I’m okay… 
Really, Akizuki-san.

229
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:18,995
Are you sure you’re not hurt anywhere?

230
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,265
Yeah.

231
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,839
I’m glad. Well, then,
let’s go finish that scene.

232
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:25,536
Yes?

233
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:28,111
I have something to say to him.

234
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,273
Without distractions.

235
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,149
O-ok.

236
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:34,015
This is bad…

237
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:36,789
I guess you bothered him too much.

238
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,182
What’ll I do?

239
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:40,323
At this rate,
I won’t become Touya’s most beloved.

240
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:43,196
I guess you’ll have
to live with it, then.

241
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:45,194
No! I don’t want to!

242
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,261
You’re really hopeless,
aren’t you?

243
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:49,534
But…

244
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:52,097
Eriol’s gonna be mad.

245
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,839
Sakura and
they are going to power-up.

246
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,874
I don’t think he’ll be too upset.

247
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:01,479
He might even be glad.

248
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:08,514
Yuki… I know all about it… You…

249
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:10,249
We’ve done that scene already…

250
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,483
No. Please listen.

251
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,198
I know you’re not human.

252
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,995
So you have no reason to hide from me.

253
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,586
We finally meet.

254
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:41,115
Your name is?

255
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,178
Yue.

256
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:51,931
Yukito wanted you to know.
About him and about me.

257
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,030
That is why I came.

258
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,704
That’s fine by me.

259
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:04,633
I heard you say you
wouldn’t let us disappear.

260
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:05,570
Yes.

261
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:08,673
Do you know what you’d have to do?

262
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:09,913
I know.

263
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,176
You can have my strength.

264
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:13,516
All of it.

265
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:16,356
You may never see your mother again.

266
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,449
It’s unfair that
I’m the only one who can see her.

267
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:20,588
However…

268
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:25,495
Without my power,
I won’t be able to protect Sakura.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,532
Will you protect her for me?

270
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,035
There’s no need to ask.

271
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,698
I’d protect her, anyway.

272
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,966
I’m asking anyway.

273
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,334
Promise you’ll protect her.

274
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,606
Protect all of them.

275
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,447
That’s all you want for your magic?

276
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:48,052
That’s it.

277
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,350
It’s a deal then.

278
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,729
The two of you aren’t so different.

279
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,416
My power has returned.

280
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:31,522
Thanks you for your help.

281
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:40,505
You heard.

282
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,341
I’m sorry.

283
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:45,773
Because my power wasn’t strong enough…

284
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,809
you were disappearing.

285
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:54,344
And now Onii-chan
will never have his power back.

286
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:56,951
I’m so sorry.

287
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,420
It took almost all of Clow Reed’s magic

288
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:06,694
to create and maintain the cards

289
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:08,431
To think that a child

290
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,736
Like you has managed to do the same…

291
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:11,828
But…

292
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,544
It would hurt him,
if anything happened to you.

293
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:22,011
I promised him I’d protect you.

294
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,015
So, don’t cry.

295
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:27,413
Ok.

296
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,522
I’m sorry Onii-chan.

297
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:36,494
If you need anything,
I’ll help you.

298
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,961
I will protect you.

299
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:50,639
Ah! This aura!

300
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:51,636
It’s Clow!

301
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:57,748
Nobody’s here.

302
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,384
The aura is has gone too.

303
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:04,754
Yue’s power has returned.

304
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,420
And, now, Sakura will get even stronger.

305
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:09,862
Things are coming to an end.

306
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,093
I shall have to hurry.

307
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:18,204
So that’s what happened.

308
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,105
And your brother…?

309
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,301
He’s still asleep.

310
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,472
His classmates said they’d
send him home, later.

311
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:29,048
And, Yukito-san is watching over him.

312
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,448
He’ll be okay.

313
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:42,627
Thank you for being there.

314
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:43,688
Until tomorrow, okay?

315
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:45,624
Tomorrow, then.

316
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,028
Bye.

317
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,740
W… W… Welcome back! And how was the filming?

318
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,182
Onii-chan knew…

319
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:15,059
About you… And about Yukito and Yue.

320
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,734
WHAT???? I see…
So, he has no magic, now.

321
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:28,102
Kero-chan, did you know?

322
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:32,803
Did you know he was disappearing because
I wasn’t strong enough?

323
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:34,545
I knew.

324
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,378
Why didn’t you tell me?

325
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:40,784
Because there was nothing you could do.

326
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,283
What…?

327
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:46,716
You wouldn’t be able to support it.

328
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,152
All your magic is used in fighting.

329
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,956
Any more would completely wear you out.

330
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:58,999
And, so, there was nothing you could do.

331
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,365
I… guess I’m not good enough

332
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,306
to protect you, then

333
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,270
That’s not what I mean!
You’re always worrying about us,

334
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:10,483
and you are our friend.
There’s no one better!

335
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,015
Thank you.

336
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,090
You know, Kero-chan…

337
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,924
I was really worried

338
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,427
when I thought I might lose him.

339
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:30,429
It would be very hard to lose

340
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:35,197
my most important person.

341
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:37,206
Sakura…

342
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,837
You know, I don’t want to lose him

343
00:21:42,482 --> 00:21:43,949
without letting him know I care.

344
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:48,818
I’m going to tell him…

345
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,752
how I feel.
