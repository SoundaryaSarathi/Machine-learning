1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,189
Miyazawa-san?

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:06,160
She's really scary when you
make her mad.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,464
She's a corrupted representative!

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:09,301
Like, all she cares about is herself.

5
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,069
But, she was really nice in the beginning.

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,163
Yeah, she seemed really helpful.

8
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:15,539
She was?

9
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:17,968
Yeah, don't you remember
she looked over your homework?

11
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:18,902
Oh yeah.

12
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,609
It feels like that was so long ago.

13
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:22,878
Was it the day before yesterday?

14
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:24,714
I saw her dancing wildly in the hall
saying that she beat Arima...

16
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,054
...on the English pop quiz.

17
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:31,020
I got the feeling that
that was who she really was.

19
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,956
She can do ten times the
work of one, to be sure.

20
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:36,258
I remember well that nobody could...

21
00:00:36,697 --> 00:00:38,688
...defy her when she ordered them around...

22
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,600
...while drinking Gator*bleep* with
this deathly look on her face.

23
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,132
What? Oh, she was the epitome
of a model student at first.

25
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,134
But you can't judge people
by appearances.

26
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,810
She's tougher than she looks.

27
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,844
Shall I say, she's a student who is like dried
squid;

28
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:55,339
She becomes more interesting the more you chew.

31
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,614
Our sister is an airhead.

32
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:06,286
Yep, an airhead.

33
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:12,293
It's awful!

34
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,061
Arima, listen!

35
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:15,091
Hm? What's up?

36
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,671
Today, I was walking down the hall,
and this guy, as he passed me...

38
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,839
...mumbles "You know, Miyazawa-san's
really more macho than she looks."

39
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,877
What kind of butch word is that?!

40
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:27,008
How dare he use it to describe a girl!

41
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,109
C-could it have just been your imagination?

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,044
No, he definitely said so! I heard him.

43
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:37,850
I, who used to be called beautiful,
with the grace of a prize-winning carp!

46
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,817
What in the world are you?
WHOA! GROSS! Snot everywhere!

48
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:46,089
Oh the good old days when I could
leave all annoying things to the guys
and just take the juicy bits.

51
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,033
The feel for ecstasy I've been used to
for so long, no that I was born with...

53
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,768
...can't be changed so easily.

54
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:52,994
You're still complaining?

55
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:54,770
You stopped being pretentious, remember?

56
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:57,433
You just think it's none of your concern.

57
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:01,648
My ostentatious life, at the height
of its splendor is finally about to
become a thing of the past!

60
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,475
There's no way I can let it go so easily!

61
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:07,380
You're so naive, Arima-kun.

62
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,784
Just accept that this is
how she'll always be.

64
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,851
When it's coming from you it
pisses me off for some reason!

65
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,256
That's empty, you know.

66
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,762
It just means that, after all,

67
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,666
your love falls far short of
our friendship.

68
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,033
You're the one who's naive, Asapin.

69
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,337
Now don't get jealous...

70
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:27,398
What did he switch?

71
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:32,905
There isn't a single millimeter for
you to come between us anymore!!

74
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:34,007
M-Miyazawa?!

75
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,244
Wh-what's that? What do you mean?

76
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,747
Wh-what do I mean? Well...

77
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,279
What's that reaction...?

78
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:42,714
N-no way!

79
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:45,855
What's that mean?
You mean you guys actually?!

81
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,491
J-just shut up.

82
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:49,759
You shouldn't ask about such things.

83
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:54,061
How could you?!
Both of you didn't even tell me!

84
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:55,626
What are you talking about?!

85
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:56,730
Wait, Hideaki!

86
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:58,127
Did you see that?

87
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,698
Arima-kun made Asaba-kun cry!

88
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:01,003
Th-that's not it!

89
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:02,430
He's misunderstanding things!

90
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,740
Just leave him be.

91
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,638
I told him to leave him be,

92
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:08,945
but he ran after him anyway.

93
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:10,346
Don't say I didn't warn him.

94
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:15,215
Arima's become rather comfortable
in his comedy routine with Asapin lately.

96
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:16,990
That's just not a good thing.

97
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,220
Could it be that we're the ones
who are playing into his hands?

98
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:26,897
Really?

99
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,963
Can we?
Can we really still be friends like before?

101
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:32,166
I'm telling you, it's nothing!

102
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:35,436
Yeah, don't worry, we'll be like before.

103
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,308
Really?

104
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,904
Um, I'm making a poetry collection,

105
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,540
and I want you to pick the ones you think are good.
I'll print those.

107
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,210
Well, I still have committee work to do now...

108
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,115
What the hell am I doing?

109
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:53,651
I thought I knew what I was getting into,

111
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,953
but changing yourself into
what you want is pretty hard.

114
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,494
If Arima and I hadn't become
boyfriend and girlfriend, I
wonder what would have happened to me?

115
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,870
If Arima hadn't appeared before me?
Text:A Simulation

116
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:08,903
Well, knowing me, there's no mistake...
Text:A Simulation

117
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:12,906
...I would have shrewdly enjoyed the
vain lifestyle just like before...
Text:The Year 20XX

119
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,937
You just don't understand.

120
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,474
The most important thing about
guys is their income!

121
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,443
Their looks come second!

122
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,98
Tsuki & Kano:You're tough, Sis.
Miyazawa:The world is about money, really!


123
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,748
Tsuki & Kano:She doesn't need a husband.
Money money!

124
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,721
I might have gotten myself into trouble.

125
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,791
Miyazawa! Miyazawa!

126
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,357
That's odd, where did she go?

127
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:32,828
Oh, Arima!

128
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:33,995
Do you know where Miyazawa is?

129
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:35,457
Maybe she went home?

130
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:38,526
If it's Asaba-kun I saw
him walk by crying just now.

132
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:40,236
We couldn't bring ourselves to
approach him.

133
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,065
O-oh, you can just let him be.

134
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,573
She promised to meet me to
talk about the Culture Fair today...

136
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,410
Tsubasa, you know anything?

137
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,614
She's useless.

138
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:59,525
Oh I know, Yukinon was drinking juice at
the vending machine corner with Tonami.

140
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:00,551
Oh yeah... Yeah,

141
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,660
Why don't you ask Tonami-kun?

142
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:03,791
Thanks

143
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,009
What am I doing?

144
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,453
Miyazawa?!

145
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:35,517
The only change that happened
is that I stopped being vain,

147
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,728
but my greediness hasn't changed one bit.

149
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,494
Can this count as having changed?

150
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,060
I feel gypped.

151
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,604
Oh, that's enough.

152
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:50,575
Worrying like this is just
going to get me more depressed.

154
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,035
What about Arima?

155
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,671
I wonder if he thinks about this kind
of thing all the time?

156
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,444
My real parents vanished,
leaving me, their son, behind.

158
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:02,412
I'm sure they were the shame
of the family.

159
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,914
When my current parents came to get me,
I was told to my face:

160
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,985
That a kid born from such parents
would never amount to anything.

161
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:08,952
So?

162
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:11,455
I had to become a perfectly flawless person.

163
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:13,196
I absolutely had to.

164
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,829
At that time, something occured to me.

165
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:20,938
Could it be that what I had believed
was me until then was merely a fake
I had created purely by effort?

168
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:24,133
Was there another real me
somewhere inside?

169
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:26,402
What if I'm a terrible person?!

172
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:33,281
What causes Arima to have dark feelings?
What makes him suffer so much?

173
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:34,915
About the truth

174
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:38,018
I still don't know anything about
what it really is.

175
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:47,130
Th-that's... Arima?!

176
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,729
No! No! I don't want to look

177
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,631
Why? Isn't that you? He's crying.

178
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:52,972
Are you just going to leave him like that?

179
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:55,633
If you're scared,

180
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:57,966
I'll go with you.

181
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,878
This is something you have to
solve yourself, Arima.

182
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:04,283
I don't really know, but I have
a feeling that it is.

183
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,886
All I can do is support you.

184
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,889
Come this way.

185
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,597
Come on. Come on! What are you doing?!
You cannot do that

186
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:28,670
Arima!

187
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:31,001
Arima, that's not it.

188
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,205
That's not what Arima wanted.

189
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:40,580
I felt that everybody, deep down, rejects me

190
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,021
and that they all have malice toward me.

191
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,657
My current parents were the first
ones to alleviate that feeling.

193
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:51,597
Even so, the thought of having people dislike
me was terrifying just to imagine.

197
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:56,666
So I behaved so that nobody would dislike me,
that nobody would look down upon me.

199
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,338
Before I knew it, I was called
a model student,

200
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:04,966
I'm scared but really I was only
the product of my fear of getting hurt

203
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,338
and my refusal to get
involved too deeply with others

205
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,579
Arima.

206
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,917
Sometime I think

208
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,642
I don't think analyzing yourself
is very reliable.

209
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,487
R-really?

210
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:21,690
I'm sure the reason you ended up the
way you are now isn't something that
can be put into words so easily.

213
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,359
You may not realize it,

215
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,500
but you've been influenced by?
...many more things than you think.
and you became the way you are.

217
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,261
And besides, what you think changes a
lot depending on your mood at the time.

219
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:35,500
And I like the serious Arima too.

221
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,068
Even when I'm being difficult,

222
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,434
she humors me so easily.

223
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,608
Against Miyazawa, I'm like a child.

224
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,242
Without her, I'm...

225
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:51,390
I still have to change.
Miyazawa.

226
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:15,437
I used to have almost absolute confidence,

227
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,846
and never thought about anyone but myself

228
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,622
And yet this change feels so good now.

230
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,789
Oh, Arima! Where's Arima?

231
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:30,829
Arima...

232
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:34,630
Hey! Arima! Arima! Hey!

233
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,737
I wonder if we met to change each other.

235
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,271
If so, by changing,

236
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,842
maybe we're going to lose the
necessity to stay as distinct beings.

238
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,442
Well, that's fine too, I think.

240
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,774
We'd seem similar, but we'd be
different in little ways.

242
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:57,649
Through repeated encounters and farewells
we'll probably continue to change from now on.

244
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:00,519
Oh, is that really it, Sis?

245
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,021
Isn't that wrapping things up too well?

246
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,955
That's right!

247
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:08,197
This isn't the time to be dwelling by myself.

248
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,060
We haven't grasped anything definite yet!

249
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,140
And let's promise,

250
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,151
that even if that does happens some day,

251
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:32,414
that we'll never forget
the things we felt together.

253
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,707
A review of what's happened!

254
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:30,370
Pardon our abruptness,

255
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:32,712
but our sister, the masked model
student Miyazawa Yukino...

256
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,646
...in class 1-A of Kanazawa
Prefectural Hokuei High...

257
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,710
...is the ultimate queen of vanity.

258
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:37,912
She lived only to show off in front of others,

259
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,616
no matter what.

260
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,180
She successfully played the perfect
model student in public...

261
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:42,987
...seemingly elegant and graceful, blessed
with both beauty and intelligence.

262
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,016
She's so narcissistic!

263
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,319
But because of a certain error on her part,

264
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,355
that mask was finally stripped away!

265
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,993
Oh she's so careless!

266
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,089
The one lucky, or perhaps unlucky,

267
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,829
enough to first find out her true identity
was an unusual person named...

268
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,397
Arima Souichirou! (Sis's classmate)

269
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,104
He was also a perfect model student.

270
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,474
He gets excellent grades,

271
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,737
excels at every sport, and is generally?

272
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,010
...a sociable guy who is friendly to everyone

273
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:06,402
and who would never make any enemies.

274
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,743
In addition, he was totally a Gucci?

275
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,012
...thoroughbred whose family was a pedigree?

276
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:11,510
...that went all the way back to the Edo period.

277
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,442
However, he was quite a wily dude himself.

278
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,480
He was rather an evil schemer..

279
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:18,551
...who made Sis help him with
his own work...

280
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,019
...by taking adantage of the fact that
he had a hold of her weakness!

281
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,285
Sis is in big trouble!

282
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,795
But she ended up feeling love
for the first time,

283
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,856
towards her enemy of all people,
and got herself into a panic.

284
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,426
Sis fell into a total mess of a situation!

285
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,127
After being in a state of ineffectiveness...

286
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,131
...due to her rampant imagination...

287
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:34,801
...she finally snaps, but!

288
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,800
After a lot of fuss, they make up.

289
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,734
They come to hold a secret as
model students...

290
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,736
...with dual personalities

291
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,341
though how they became that way differed.

292
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,716
And later, after passing through phases as...

293
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:47,052
...partners in the Student
Assembly, good friends...

294
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:48,718
...and more than friends but not
quite going steady...

295
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,749
...they finally become a couple.

296
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:54,623
And, being affected by each other's lives...

297
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,289
...they decide to live for
their own real happiness!

298
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,858
We're so happy for you Sis!

299
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,700
Yeah but, the world isn't that simple.

300
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:07,130
That's right. Society is a cruel thing!

301
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,774
First, the menace of the Athletic Festival...

302
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,604
...which forced them to be super
busy and not see each other...

303
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:13,477
...as though to challenge their relationship.

304
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,744
Following which was the appearance
of the delinquent...

305
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,776
...perverted hunk Asaba Hideaki...

306
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:19,809
...who plotted to demoralize Sis and
interfered with her activities in order...

307
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:21,175
...to possibly break them up...

308
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,578
...and use Arima-kun once he
became single again...

309
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,115
...so he could carry out his ambition...

310
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,182
the Asaba Mary-Land Project!

311
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,618
Their long-awaited first date ends in failure...

312
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:29,962
...and they react to it by...

313
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,160
...ignoring their studies...

314
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:32,623
...and filling their days with...

315
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:34,096
...rendezvous and misunderstandings!

316
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,059
And so forth...

317
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:37,629
...Sis faced up to this series of challenges...

318
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,470
...and enriched her life experience!

319
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,404
Sis savors her transient happiness...

322
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,509
And after school when nobody was around
amidst the rolling thunder, they finally

324
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,043
Ohmigod! What's going on?! Eeeek!

325
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,887
God that was embarrassing.

326
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,439
In July of the same year...

327
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,143
...the final exams ended without incident.

328
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:26,176
The result was that Miyazawa Yukino, who
had been faithfully yielding to her desires...

329
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,477
...dropped in rank precipitously.

330
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:30,751
But Arima Souichirou, who
had done the same...

331
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,680
...only went down in rank a little bit.

332
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,521
She suspects he had played foul...

333
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,452
...and a rift formed between them already.

334
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,624
Meanwhile, the school...

335
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:40,287
...taking the matter seriously...

336
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,759
...immediately calls them up and
tries to talk them out of it.

337
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:43,635
But she surprisingly opposes them
and firmly refuses.

338
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,528
The situation worsens.

339
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,604
However, the matter was easily...

340
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:48,939
...put to rest with her...

341
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:50,309
...father's words.

342
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:51,737
On a roll...

343
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:53,609
...she goes to the unchaperoned Arima house...

344
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,981
...and lets herself experience her second kiss.

345
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:57,314
Arima feels gratitude for the importance...

346
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,651
...of her existence for him.

347
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,680
Meanwhile, Miyaza Yukino was about...

348
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,419
...face the greatest crisis of her life.

350
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:11,294
She was ignored by all the girls in the class
led by Isawa Maho who had independently
analyzed her and figured out her true nature.

351
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:17,495
There was also an attack by Shibahime
Tsubasa, who had secretly liked Arima.

354
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:23,436
Although it was something that
she had brought upon herself,

355
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,410
it was a sudden outbreak of multiple problems;

356
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:28,244
yet Miyazawa Yukino brushes aside
Arima's helping hand

357
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,870
and dauntlessly confronts them by herself.

358
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,238
After a brief deadlock, she snaps due to
Shibahime Tsubasa's harassment,

359
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,584
and loses control of herself.

360
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,680
She goes berserk and plunges
the school into the depths of fear.

361
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:38,951
This state of absolute terror corners Shibahime
Tsubasa both physically and mentally,

362
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,324
and the situation takes care of itself.

363
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,753
Miyazawa Yukino suddenly acquires
friends for the first time.

364
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,650
A review of what's happened!

365
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,116
...Eh. This is a real drag.

366
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:13,621
Aya, you're into humanities, so
you just do whatever with it.
I don't want to do it either, it's annoying.

369
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:14,483
Rika, you do it.

370
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,589
Who, me?

371
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,652
I wouldn't be able to wrap it up well.

372
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:21,559
Er, um... Maho-san, you do it!

373
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,463
What? I don't want to just be
an exposition character either.

374
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,238
Oh, wouldn't she be perfect for this?

375
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,230
She hasn't spoken much lately anyway.

376
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:30,033
She took Arima.

377
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:32,977
...Thank you for the perfect explanation.

378
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,641
Say, can I speak some more?

379
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:36,773
Go ahead.

380
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:42,149
When will Shibahime Tsubasa ever be
returned from a beast to a human?

381
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,622
Will that day ever come?

382
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,854
Or is my role here over already?

383
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:52,731
What happened to the story where
I introduce Kazuma to my friends?!

384
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,657
Well this is the only time left for me.

385
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,798
All joking aside...

386
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,798
...this could seriously be the last time...

387
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,166
...I'm going to speak normally.

388
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,510
Sorry I guess I'm just complaining.

390
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:09,436
We sympathize wholeheartedly.
Ok, back to the topic at hand...

392
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,482
Well, lots of things happened over
summer vacation.

394
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:13,107
We did the usual thing and went
to a karaoke bar,

395
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,451
...did window shopping, and hung
out at a cafe.

398
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,213
And we went to the beach.

399
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,181
What else did we do?

400
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:20,649
I think Yukinon went on a family trip.

401
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,552
Lucky. I want to go to a hot spring.

402
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,386
What an old-geezer...

403
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,557
...thing to say, Tsubaki.

404
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:27,763
You're still young.

405
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:28,861
So what? Those who belittle...

406
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:30,633
...hot springs will cry over it one day.

407
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,503
When you're over 25 you get to...

408
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,203
...understand what a good thing it is.

409
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:35,596
Really...

410
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:39,042
Come to think of it, doesn't Arima-kun
seem rather weird lately?

412
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,241
Isn't he just being too self-conscious?

413
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:45,918
Seriously. You can't understand
everything about other people.

415
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,017
It's questionable how much you
even know about your own self.

417
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,713
But they seem different these days.

419
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:54,488
I wonder if they went all
the way over the summer.

421
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,660
But they seem so unlikely
to do that kind of thing.

423
00:18:58,064 --> 00:18:59,429
You never know with men and women.

424
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,494
It's all about the mood and the timing.

425
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:05,127
Well, I wouldn't care.
I'd do it if I wanted to.

427
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:06,697
It's not something you can criticize others for.

428
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,164
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,839
What is with these people...

430
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,308
So what are we going to do about wrapping it up?

431
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,710
Aren't we almost out of time now?

432
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,611
We should just say whatever.

433
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,312
The long summer vacation is over and
second semester has finally started.

434
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,654
How's that?

436
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:24,750
Hmm, rather half-hearted...

437
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,782
Ok, then the mysterious transfer student,

438
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:28,117
Tonami Takefumi, appeared.

439
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,051
And we're still getting ready for the play...

440
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:31,330
...we're going to do at the Culture Fair.

441
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,130
We just finally started to
get rolling on that too.

442
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,658
It feels like it's going
to be a long 2 weeks.

444
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:40,735
My screen time was too short!
My screen time! My screen time!

446
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,099
At least like a human! My screen time!

448
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,067
Ok, ok.

449
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:48,475
Well, this would do just fine.

450
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:53,336
What'll happen next!

451
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:54,896
Sis is super busy with?

452
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,103
...all these things happening at once!

453
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,772
But unrelated to that,

454
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,372
I was being followed by an
unidentified shadow!

455
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,436
Is this what they call a stalker?!

456
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,270
Or is it the beginning of spring?!

457
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:04,910
what to know? See the next act!
