1
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,030
Are you alright?

2
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,340
Yeah, looks like it.

3
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,220
Shinichirou's gone too?

4
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah...

5
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Well... I don't think it's too big of a problem.

6
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,920
Have you called him yet?

7
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,060
Looks like he turned it off.

8
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,460
If... something happened...

9
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,930
Don't be so worried.

10
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm going out to look for him.

11
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,330
Hold on! Looking for him without thinking first...

12
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,530
Your bike caught on fire.

13
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,780
Yeah...

14
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,770
What should I do... I still have loans remaining on it.

15
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,490
But, it looks kind of pretty.

16
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,010
And I bought a girl's bike for work...

17
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,720
Argh... damn it...

18
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,200
It didn't explode after the gas caught on fire.

19
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,210
Of course, it only happens in movies.

20
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,020
All it does is burn.

21
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,780
If it would just explode, it'd be easier to let go.

22
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,210
You've got any money to call for a taxi?

23
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,870
Yup, I do.

24
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,690
But...

25
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,030
But I wonder if we can even find a taxi.

26
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:13,980
Hiromi!

27
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,270
Shinichirou-kun...

28
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,860
Onii-chan!

29
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,260
We are alright.

30
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,320
You sure you two will be alright without calling an ambulance?

31
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,040
You sure you're alright?

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,320
Onii-chan!

33
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm fine.

34
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,610
I don't think I'm hurt...

35
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,290
I...

36
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,160
Thank god...

37
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,300
I'm sorry...

38
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,310
Remember to file the report at the police tomorrow.

39
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes...

40
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,480
Well, all that matters is that you two aren't hurt.

41
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,280
What are you doing, mom?

42
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,920
Wait!

43
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,990
It's alright.

44
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,340
It's better to leave the ladies to themselves.

45
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,990
Mom's just too strange though!

46
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,220
She's putting strange thoughts into Hiromi's head!

47
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,540
Yeah, well...

48
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,400
So it's true?

49
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,030
Hiromi and I really are siblings?!

50
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,370
Enough of this!

51
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,670
Calm down.

52
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,330
There's no way this could be true, right?

53
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,110
Thank god you aren't hurt.

54
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,930
Why don't you get a change of clothes?

55
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,760
I'll help you out.

56
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,200
No, it's alright.

57
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,730
I can do it myself...

58
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,690
That couldn't have happened, could it?

59
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,040
Mom! Hiromi! Where are you?

60
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,040
Are you in here?

61
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,240
You are in here, right? I'm coming in.

62
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,310
Mom, you know...

63
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,780
I...

64
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,230
I'm tired...

65
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,460
My clothes are all dirty now,

66
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,700
I need to change.

67
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,170
Th- Then... we'll talk later.

68
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,110
But... you're acting weird, Mom.

69
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,970
"Raigoumaru climbed up to the top of the hill."

70
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,380
"It was a huge embankment, reaching 10 meters tall."

71
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,490
"Looking from there, it seemed like the ground was the underworld."

72
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,550
"Ground, who was there pecking at the feed, looked so pitiful."

73
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,710
"Now, let's fly."

74
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,530
What's this? What's going on?

75
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,490
"Even if that's what Raigoumaru was thinking, his stomach suddenly started growling."

76
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,810
"So in the end, he decided to call it a day."

77
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,390
"Tomorrow, after filling his stomach, he'll try to fly to the sky again."

78
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,300
Seems like i can't fly after all...

79
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,300
Hiromi, what side dishes might you have today?

80
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,110
Taking others into consideration, how unlike Tomoe.

81
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,240
Is that so?

82
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:15,920
But, being the best friend of the main character in this school's shocking, big scandal can be devastating for a mere high school girl!

83
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,580
Sorry...

84
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,890
Idiot. What should I do about your worrying?

85
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,880
That's exactly why I feel inadequate. {"watashi no tachiba ga nai", could be translated "I have no place" etc etc, I think this is a fairly good translation of it.}

86
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,400
Thanks.

87
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,230
I'll at least pass on the latest gossip.

88
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,170
Right now, a staff meeting is taking place.

89
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,760
The subject is our school's prodigal basketball ace.{It's about one of the excels at the school, queen of the basketball team, beautiful, and pretty...}

90
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,250
She, who is called beautiful and handsome...

91
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,600
What's the matter?

92
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,110
Those mean the same thing.

93
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,870
What?

94
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,310
Elegant and handsome.

95
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,210
Oh, is that so?

96
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,560
Well, fine! Let's eat up.

97
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,560
Here, let's switch these for today.

98
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,320
You were at the site of Yuasa Hiromi's accident, right?

99
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,080
Yup.

100
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,550
That No. 4 was unharmed, too?

101
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,380
Yup.

102
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,260
Meh, lucky bastard.

103
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,240
Hey, you know...

104
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,040
No, it's nothing.

105
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,190
Yo, Nakagami, why don't you tell us...

106
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,150
About what really happened.

107
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,930
Thanks.

108
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,430
Me and you... are friends, right?

109
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm heading back to the classroom.

110
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,110
We can't help it, that's what the teachers said.

111
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,100
Captain Takaoka, when did you become such a rule-abiding person?

112
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,710
When you say she's suspended, you mean from tomorrow, right?

113
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Alright then, please allow me to skip today's practice too.

114
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,420
I thought you'd say that.

115
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,300
Why don't you go hang out with Hiromi?

116
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,980
Yes, thank you very much!

117
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,750
Let's work hard for Hiromi and Tomoyo as well!

118
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,750
Yes!

119
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,710
Isn't... that...?

120
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,140
He said "I love Noe"... and he even wrote it down here...

121
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,980
Thanks for the food.

122
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,380
You're welcome.

123
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,990
I'm heading out.

124
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,520
There's a fight!

125
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,650
What are you doing?!

126
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,210
Noe...

127
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,670
Yo.

128
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,610
You scared me back there.

129
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,720
Onii-chan said he got a week off.

130
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,020
Of course, after that accident happened.

131
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,940
I'm sorry...

132
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,670
There's nothing for you to apologize for.

133
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,330
Does it hurt?

134
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,970
Were you fighting for Yuasa Hiromi?

135
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,300
Yeah...

136
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,430
Hey, how's it going, Ground?

137
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,910
I've got more of the picture book done.

138
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,450
I was thinking about showing it to you.

139
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,820
Hiromi is our child.

140
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,530
I will discipline her properly.

141
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,740
I understand.

142
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,120
You did well.

143
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,670
Raigoumaru can't seem to fly very well.

144
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Raigoumaru eventually noticed it as well,

145
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,010
In fact, even if he'd fly from a ten-meter tall cliff,

146
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,750
he couldn't get anywhere.

147
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,160
But, he pretends he doesn't know.

148
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,840
Why won't Raigoumaru face the truth?

149
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,070
It must be because he's afraid...

150
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,010
Afraid?

151
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,560
He's afraid to face the truth that he's only a chicken.

152
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,370
In fact, Raigoumaru knew from the beginning he couldn't fly.

153
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,560
So that means, Shinichirou too?

154
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,750
What are you doing? That hurts!

155
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,470
Shinichirou, you can fly.

156
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,580
You just don't know it yourself.

157
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,580
But...

158
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
That's right...

159
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,140
This isn't the place where you take flight.


160
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,400
Umm...

161
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,500
Hey, Noe!

162
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm home.

163
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,090
Welcome home.

164
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,110
I'm home.

165
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,620
Just now, I came back from school with oji-san and obaa-san.

166
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,850
You went to school?

167
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,710
Yup.

168
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,250
Ice... I bought ice cream with obaa-san on our way home.

169
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,750
I ate mine already,

170
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,830
Shinichirou-kun's is in the freezer.

171
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,190
I was just like an idiot.

172
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,580
I knew that nothing like that could have happened.

173
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,590
Something like you being my husband's child...

174
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,370
Was that story a lie?

175
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,770
I'm sorry...

176
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,080
I showed you my most shameful side.

177
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,210
So that story was a lie?

178
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,670
I've been treating you too harshly...

179
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,850
I knew from the start that obaa-san didn't like me.

180
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,870
That's right.

181
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,580
It's because there's affinity between people.

182
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,230
But this has nothing to do with that.

183
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,770
To tell you to forget about everything up until now,

184
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,290
might be asking for too much, right?

185
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,220
Is it okay if I stay here a bit longer?

186
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,940
Oh my.

187
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,290
I used to listen to that a lot in the old days.

188
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,920
Do you like it?

189
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,570
Yes.

190
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,240
I was such an idiot.

191
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,580
Thank you for worrying about me.

192
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,710
I've made up my mind.

193
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,710
That's what I am gonna do.

194
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,380
It's drawing together, more and more... {actually means fill/cover up something, but I feel like this is a more accurate translation. I might be totally off, though :P}{}{}

195
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,110
More... more...

196
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,250
Should I say thank you?

197
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,250
I will fix everything.
