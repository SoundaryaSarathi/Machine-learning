<i>[Episode 37]</i>

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,349
Your Majesty!

4
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,509
Your Majesty!

5
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,479
Your Majesty!

6
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,259
Your Majesty!

7
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,530
Your Majesty!

8
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,099
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

9
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:38,516
Your Majesty, you can't believe
what that wench Bai Qian said.

10
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,917
She used sorcery!

11
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:43,007
She used sorcery to make me this way!

12
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,477
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

13
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:48,387
That wench Bai Qian and I have
been on bad terms since we were young.

14
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:52,197
You can't believe her!
You can't believe her!

15
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,796
You and I have been married
for 70,000 years

16
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,576
yet I've never truly understood you.

17
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,217
70,000 years.

18
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:07,217
70,000 years.

19
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:12,917
Your Majesty,
you can't treat me this way.

20
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,757
You can't.

21
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:21,326
You've offended the
Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu.

22
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,907
How can I help you?

23
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,937
Do you want me to become enemies

24
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:32,046
with the entire Celestial Tribe
and Qing Qiu solely because of you

25
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,266
and have corpses of the
ghost tribe all over the place?

26
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:39,086
Your Majesty, Bai Qian hates me

27
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:43,176
because I stole the tactical formation
from Kunlun Mountain back then.

28
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,856
I caused her master to die.

29
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:49,537
That's why she's hated me
for 70,000 years.

30
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:53,917
She's taking this opportunity to kill me.

31
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,757
But Your Majesty

32
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:59,997
I went to steal the tactical
formation back then because of you.

33
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,176
Because your father wanted to kill you.

34
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,937
I saved your life, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:10,516
I betrayed the Celestial Tribe and
Qing Qiu because of you.

36
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:16,687
Now... you can't treat me like this now.

37
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:29,346
Even if I neglect governmental affairs,
I am still Ghost Lord.

38
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:35,507
The only ones I need to
protect are my people.

39
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,867
Guards.

40
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,867
Lock Ghost Queen in the Arctic Lands.

41
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,976
I will pick a date...

42
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:50,396
- to punish her.
- Yes.

43
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,896
No.

44
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,377
No!

45
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,677
Your Majesty!

46
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,947
Your Majesty!

47
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,016
Let me out of here!

48
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,646
I am the Ghost Queen.

49
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,336
How dare you lock me in here!

50
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,237
I will kill you!

51
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:36,387
I will kill you all!

52
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:52,427
Your Majesty, you can't do this to me.

53
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,776
I've done so much for you.

54
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:04,656
Without me,
you wouldn't be Ghost Lord now.

55
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:13,536
70,000 years.

56
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:17,747
We've been married for 70,000 years.

57
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:22,797
You'd actually... You'd actually
pull my limbs off and skin me

58
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:27,836
because of that wench Bai Qian?

59
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:36,877
Who is it?

60
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:41,096
Who is it?

61
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,896
Is it Your Majesty?

62
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:51,956
Your Majesty, is that you?

63
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,617
You're not His Majesty.

64
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,086
Who are you?

65
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:06,747
Xuan Nu?

66
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,617
Li Yuan?

67
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:13,026
You're Li Yuan!

68
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,026
That's impossible.

69
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,687
When you had an armed rebellion
in the Far North 300 years ago

70
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,937
didn't His Majesty kill you?

71
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:27,137
Did Li Jing tell you that?

72
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:38,747
I've been trapped in this
dark place for 300 years.

73
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:45,567
But to the Ghost Tribe,
Li Yuan is already dead?

74
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,766
What does it have to do with me
whether you're alive or dead?

75
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:55,257
At least he's kept you alive
by locking you here.

76
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:58,562
But he'd actually
pull my limbs off and skin me

77
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,867
because of that wench Bai Qian.

78
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:05,567
If he wanted to pull
your limbs off and skin you

79
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:09,166
why didn't he lock you up
using an immortal seal?

80
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:17,916
I know he can't bear to.

81
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,737
I've been married to him
for 70,000 years.

82
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:25,067
I even have a child with him.

83
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:30,067
He even blocked a blow from
Bai Qian's Kunlun fan for me today.

84
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,116
But so what if we're married?

85
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,427
If he really cared about me as his wife

86
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:42,716
he should go to war with
the Celestial Tribe for my sake

87
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:47,417
instead of killing me to
answer to the Celestial Tribe.

88
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:52,366
He is a ghost lord, yet...

89
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,067
yet because of one word
from the celestial crown prince

90
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,496
he can't even protect his queen.

91
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,956
If he doesn't want to protect you

92
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,856
can't you protect yourself?

93
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,886
I can help you.

94
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,537
You?

95
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:27,136
If you were that capable, you wouldn't
have been locked in here for 300 years.

96
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:34,317
Li Jing sealed me here.

97
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:37,756
He has sealed all my magic powers

98
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,616
and tied me here.

99
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,386
Of course I can't escape.

100
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:50,506
But you can.

101
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:58,657
Don't you want to leave here alive?

102
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:03,407
Yes! I won't just die like this.

103
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:08,956
If I die, I want that wench
Bai Qian to die first!

104
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:41,456
<i>Tell me, are you a woman?</i>

105
00:10:55,897 --> 00:11:02,136
<i>Celestial Crown Prince, so much for
you treating that wench Bai Qian so well.</i>

106
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,746
<i>You don't know, do you?</i>

107
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:07,876
<i>She and her master...</i>

108
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,876
<i>Xuan Nu, let me tell you something. </i>

109
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,777
<i>My master's body is extremely precious.</i>

110
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,267
<i>It's received blood from
my heart for 70,000 years.</i>

111
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:19,326
<i>I'm afraid your son
won't be able to handle that.</i>

112
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,562
I heard from Tian Shu
that you hurried over to Ghost Realm

113
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,356
to save your beloved.

114
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,746
I thought you'd have to
fight at least 300 rounds.

115
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:29,346
How come you came back unscathed?

116
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,157
If it has anything to do with Bai Qian

117
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:36,506
you always come back
half dead with bruises all over.

118
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:42,336
Back then, did you know
High God Mo Yuan well?

119
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,826
And High Immortal Si Yin...

120
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:49,736
Is he really Mo Yuan's favorite disciple,
as the rumors say?

121
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,697
Why are you suddenly asking about them?

122
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,486
Back then, I did see the two of them.

123
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:08,017
Mo Yuan had a special
relationship with that disciple.

124
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:13,017
He was the only one Mo Yuan brought
to Lord of Numinous Treasure's gathering.

125
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,417
I also heard another rumor.

126
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:19,897
What?

127
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,106
Rumor has it that because Yao Guang
loved Mo Yuan back then

128
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:27,216
she forcefully moved her
home to Kunlun Mountain.

129
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,767
Later, out of jealousy,
she captured Si Yin.

130
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,616
Mo Yuan was furious.

131
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:34,076
He barged into Yao Guang's
water prison cell

132
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,437
with the Sword of the Yellow Emperor

133
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:37,616
in the middle of the night
to save Si Yin.

134
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,216
And then?

135
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,667
Then Mo Yuan had a duel with
Yao Guang because of this.

136
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,037
He kicked Yao Guang
out of Kunlun Mountain.

137
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,407
If this is true

138
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:54,917
then Mo Yuan really does love
his last disciple very much.

139
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:58,937
<i>Qian Qian, did you forget about me</i>

140
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:02,336
<i>because you wanted to forget our love</i>

141
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:05,537
<i>and not because you blamed
me for taking your eyes?</i>

142
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>The person you've been
waiting 70,000 years for...</i>

143
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,307
<i>Has it always been Mo Yuan?</i>

144
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,787
Did I say something wrong?

145
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:23,386
Qian Qian should be awake at this hour.

146
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,297
I'm going to Qing Qiu
to brew her medicine.

147
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:37,726
Our crown prince will never escape
from the palm of Bai Qian's hand.

148
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,547
Where is His Highness?

149
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:54,147
He asked me to make you
a new pot of tea just now.

150
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,647
Why did he disappear?

151
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,787
He went to Qing Qiu.

152
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,147
He went to Qing Qiu again?

153
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:05,826
Princess Miao Qing,
I'll give you some advice.

154
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:10,126
You've set your heart
on the wrong person.

155
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:14,557
You should go home and ask your brother
to find you a nice man to marry.

156
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,907
Even if you served here
as a maid for 100,000 years

157
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:20,216
you will never catch Ye Hua's eye.

158
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,267
I will take my leave now.

159
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:57,466
Bi Fang, why are you here?

160
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:01,106
How do you feel? Better?

161
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:06,126
I feel much better after sleeping.

162
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:08,476
Didn't you go out west?

163
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:11,167
Fourth Brother didn't go see you?

164
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,537
Are you thirsty? Do you want water?

165
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,096
Sure.

166
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,846
Thank you, Fourth Brother.

167
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,687
You're Fourth Brother, right?

168
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,537
Because I was just in a battle
and my magic is weak right now

169
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:51,096
I couldn't see that you used magic
to change your appearance.

170
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:54,596
You took on Bi Fang's
appearance to tease me.

171
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:58,126
All right. Even though your
appearance is identical to his

172
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,197
your personality is too different.

173
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:03,797
Haven't you seen how
Bi Fang treats me normally?

174
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,706
He's completely indifferent and doesn't
pay any attention to me.

175
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:11,356
I didn't change my appearance.
I am truly Bi Fang.

176
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,187
Zhe Yan and His Highness went to
West Sea to take care of some business.

177
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:17,866
I was bored guarding the Peach Woods,
so I came here to see you.

178
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:22,576
You're Bi Fang?

179
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:31,506
Yes, you bird types are cold
unlike us fox types.

180
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:35,866
I was just randomly spewing things.
Don't take it to heart.

181
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,697
If I was by your side at that time

182
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:46,697
even if I was covered in wounds,
I wouldn't let them hurt you one bit.

183
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,136
Of course you would.

184
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,197
After all, we're from the same fox den.

185
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:56,157
If you fight with someone one day

186
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:58,996
I would go and cheer for you too.

187
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:02,506
Qian Qian, how long are you going
to keep playing dumb?

188
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:05,547
You know how much I've adored you
since I've come to Qing Qiu.

189
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:08,426
Are you saying those things
to make me angry?

190
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:13,336
You... What did you say?

191
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,307
Because you were engaged
to the celestial crown prince

192
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,426
I had to make an effort
to hide my real feelings.

193
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,277
But now, you've been
through such a disaster!

194
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,876
Yet Ye Hua couldn't protect you one bit.

195
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,517
While I was out,
I was asking around about him.

196
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,946
I heard that he has a side consort.

197
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:33,826
Who knows if a romantic like him
can treat you wholeheartedly?

198
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:36,027
How can I be at ease
leaving you with him?

199
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,856
- I--
- Qian Qian.

200
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:50,136
That Bi Fang is so stubborn.

201
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,346
He knows that Aunt and Celestial
Crown Prince are engaged

202
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,287
yet he won't let it go.

203
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,866
They say that bird types
are very faithful.

204
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,396
If they have their heart
set on one person

205
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,067
they will be with that person forever.

206
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:03,747
Bi Fang, what are you to do?

207
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:07,777
But it's strange.

208
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:11,967
After Crown Prince brought High God Mo
Yuan back here, he didn't say anything.

209
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,507
Could he have already known
that Aunt is Si Yin?

210
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,116
Drink this medicine.

211
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,126
You see...

212
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:43,997
I was first engaged
to the Celestial Tribe.

213
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,696
I'm happy that you say you adore me.

214
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:51,247
But we're not fated to be.

215
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:54,317
In all things, we must consider
first come first served, right?

216
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,696
If you're willing to be with me

217
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:59,696
I'm willing to offend
the Celestial Tribe.

218
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,297
Why don't you leave first?

219
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:10,096
You just have to tell me whether
you're willing to be with me.

220
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:22,777
I'm someone who respects
proper etiquette.

221
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,987
Since I have an engagement
with the Celestial Tribe

222
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:26,717
of course I wouldn't do anything

223
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:30,676
to make Qing Qiu and the
Nine Heavens look bad, right?

224
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:33,836
I'm grateful that you say you adore me.

225
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,047
But we just aren't fated to be.

226
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,666
I won't say any more.

227
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,067
If you can't stop your feelings for me

228
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,297
you should continue hiding them.

229
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,497
I know how you feel about me now.

230
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:50,336
I will always remember it.

231
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:00,767
Here, drink some medicine.

232
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,767
I... I can do it myself.

233
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,547
All right, you can get back to your work.

234
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,376
I'm tired. I'm tired.

235
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,416
Qian Qian.

236
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,257
You know that whenever you
don't want me by your side

237
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,196
your reason is always that you're tired?

238
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,636
Is it?

239
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:36,227
Isn't this my first time saying this?

240
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,936
Qian Qian.

241
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,886
Everything you just said was sincere.

242
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:47,487
<i>What should I do now?</i>

243
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,227
<i>After getting rid of one,
another one comes.</i>

244
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,336
Letting me get this close
to you right now...

245
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:01,586
Everything you've done for me
since I've come to Qing Qiu...

246
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,946
Is it only because we're engaged?

247
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:12,037
If you were engaged to someone else,
would you also be like this?

248
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,096
<i>Why is he asking such a strange question?</i>

249
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,777
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

250
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,487
<i>If we weren't engaged</i>

251
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,376
<i>would he be able to freeload off
of me here again and again?</i>

252
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:23,307
<i>Mi Gu would have kicked him out
when he first got to Qing Qiu.</i>

253
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,817
<i>He wouldn't have gotten
to come inside the Fox Den</i>

254
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,797
<i>and gotten one of the best rooms.</i>

255
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:35,317
Of course it's not just because we're
engaged that I treat you like this.

256
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:48,027
You see, all this time that
you've been at the Fox Den

257
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:51,247
you've worked so hard
reading all the documents.

258
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:54,606
You've even cooked for us.

259
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:57,777
I really appreciate all that
you've done for us.

260
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,257
I'll remember them too.

261
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:02,386
As they say, give and take.

262
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,446
Since you've given me a peach

263
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:07,326
of course I have to give you a plum.

264
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,997
If I don't have a plum

265
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,507
I have to at least substitute it
with a loquat for now.

266
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:16,507
Although we are engaged

267
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:21,747
if it were someone else,
he wouldn't treat me as well as you do.

268
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:29,176
I've never cooked for anyone else.

269
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,047
I've only cooked for you.

270
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,866
Your cooking skills are really good.

271
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:42,146
You should find the opportunity to cook
for your father, mother, and grandfather.

272
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,396
Then you'd be the
true embodiment of filial piety.

273
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:48,336
I didn't do all this for you
because we're engaged.

274
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:52,876
I didn't come to live in Qing Qiu
just because A-Li misses you.

275
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,257
So cooking is your hobby?

276
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:02,037
That's a good hobby.
It's really practical.

277
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:09,977
Qian Qian, I love you.

278
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,467
<i>Today... what's going on today?</i>

279
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,936
<i>I've had no budding romances
for thousands of years</i>

280
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,406
<i>and now I suddenly have two.</i>

281
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:17,547
<i>One after the other,
they both say they adore me.</i>

282
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,426
<i>What's going on?</i>

283
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:23,166
You can't joke about this kind of thing.

284
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,717
I've never been more serious in my life.

285
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:32,176
Without love, people can still be
married for a long time.

286
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:35,866
But I want to love you
for a long, long time.

287
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:40,707
I... Mother and Father said that

288
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:43,307
after a married couple has
been together for a long time

289
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:47,626
the romance in the air weakens.

290
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:55,906
Slowly, you just become family.

291
00:23:55,906 --> 00:24:02,517
You see, we're quite like
a family right now, right?

292
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:09,277
So I think we can skip over
the middle part.

293
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:11,426
What do you think?

294
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:21,567
I know that for someone your age

295
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:25,497
you should go through
a few relationships.

296
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,797
So since your feelings for me
aren't that strong yet

297
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:32,977
you should get rid of them quickly.

298
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:37,596
You'll know when you get to my age.

299
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:40,196
You'll stop caring deeply
about many things.

300
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:44,126
You'll lose interest in
something like love.

301
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:48,477
It's a world where
it's lonely at the top.

302
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:55,987
I've always thought that the engagement
agreement that binds us together

303
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,866
was unfair for you.

304
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,396
You're still so young.

305
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:02,596
But you don't have to
be too upset about it.

306
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:06,376
If we really do get married,
I will make arrangements

307
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:09,797
so that you can marry a few
young and beautiful side consorts.

308
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:21,656
Are you saying what you truly feel?

309
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:25,707
Yes. It's truly how I feel.

310
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:29,797
So you're saying these
things to upset me?

311
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:36,076
<i>It really does seem
as if he truly loves me.</i>

312
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,876
<i>What do I do?</i>

313
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:42,717
<i>I have to take some time
to think about this.</i>

314
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,886
I will only love you.

315
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:53,037
I won't love anyone else.

316
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:14,876
A-Li has already returned
to the Celestial Palace.

317
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:18,507
He will be fine after
resting for a few days.

318
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,787
I wanted to take you there too.

319
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,807
The Heaven's Spring in Lord of Numinous
Treasures's Realm of Supreme Purity

320
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:26,106
can help you heal your wounds.

321
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:31,807
But that mount kept getting in my way

322
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,096
so you'll have to decide
if you want to go or not.

323
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,727
I'll do as you suggest.

324
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:42,906
Hurry and get some sleep.

325
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:13,636
<i>If I didn't see Mo Yuan myself</i>

326
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:19,217
<i>I wouldn't have dared to believe that
someone could look so much like me.</i>

327
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:23,886
<i>Qian Qian, did you look upon
me as High God Mo Yuan</i>

328
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:26,717
<i>and that's why you allowed
me to stay in Qing Qiu?</i>

329
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:38,396
Xuan Nu and Kunlun Mountain
really have an ill-fated relationship.

330
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:43,116
The thing I regret the most is falling
for her scheme 70,000 years ago.

331
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:47,017
I let her into Kunlun Mountain and she
was able to steal the tactical formation.

332
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:51,317
She caused the deaths of Master and
so many Celestial soldiers.

333
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:54,067
There is something
that I don't understand.

334
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:58,207
Back then, how did Si Yin
take away Mo Yuan's body

335
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,596
under all the disciples' watchful eyes?

336
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:05,457
Since you're asking me that,
I won't keep it from you.

337
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,267
I am quite ashamed.

338
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,836
70,000 years ago

339
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:13,396
Master sacrificed his soul to
seal the Bell of the East Emperor.

340
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:16,817
It was Seventeenth
who got all of us disciples drunk

341
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:20,467
and took Master's body
away from Kunlun Mountain.

342
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,537
That's what happened?

343
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:25,037
At that time, we were all in mourning.

344
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,366
We didn't think Seventeenth
would do such a thing.

345
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:31,317
But I know that it was
because Seventeenth didn't want

346
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,136
Master to be buried in
the Sea of Innocence.

347
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:37,356
Because he didn't believe
that Master was dead.

348
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:46,737
Why do you think Si Yin has been avoiding
all the other disciples for 70,00 years?

349
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,376
I don't really know either.

350
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:55,376
From what I know about Seventeenth,
he hasn't appeared in 70,000 years...

351
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:58,636
probably because he has a way
to make Master come back.

352
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:05,317
If you have no other questions,
I'll go back to West Sea.

353
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:07,067
My mother sent me a
tearful letter a few days ago.

354
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,247
She says my brother's
illness has gotten worse.

355
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,086
It's time for me to go back to see him.

356
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:12,527
What happened?

357
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,227
My brother's illness came out of nowhere.

358
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,916
He's especially weak right now.

359
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,967
Fortunately a few days ago,
Zhe Yan was able to go by to see him.

360
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,636
Hopefully he can find
the cause of the illness.

361
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:25,086
With Zhe Yan there,
you don't have to worry.

362
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:28,906
I hope it is as you say.

363
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:53,186
Your Highness.

364
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:54,767
Tidy up the room.

365
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,866
Someone will come to live here tomorrow.

366
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,586
To live in Hall of Beautiful Youth?

367
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:05,656
When A-Li sees her,
he'll be absolutely delighted.

368
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,836
He won't let her live anywhere else.

369
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,386
It's that High Goddess?

370
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:13,426
Before A-Li fell asleep, he kept
mentioning that high goddess's name.

371
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:15,757
He said he liked eating
with his mother at Qing Qiu

372
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:18,797
and buying toys and food
at the Mushroom Market.

373
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:22,346
He said it was merrier there
than at the Celestial Palace.

374
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:34,916
His Highness hasn't let anyone step
into this courtyard for 300 years.

375
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,926
Because that High Goddess
is the next Celestial Queen

376
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:41,457
she gets special treatment?

377
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:56,156
Your Highness.

378
00:30:56,156 --> 00:31:00,237
I heard His Highness has come back.

379
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,557
He left again.

380
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,797
He left again?

381
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:09,957
He went to Qing Qiu again?

382
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:12,336
Yes.

383
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,987
Did you speak to His Highness?

384
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:20,547
No.

385
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:31,346
It's okay.
There will be an opportunity eventually.

386
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:39,196
His Highness is the crown prince
of the celestial tribe.

387
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,817
He won't keep living in Qing Qiu.

388
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,517
And even if that Bai Qian
is the queen of Qing Qiu

389
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:49,076
she'll have to come to
Xiwu Palace eventually.

390
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:52,537
After all, she is the
crown princess consort.

391
00:31:56,176 --> 00:32:00,926
You and I just have to quietly wait.

392
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,467
Yes.

393
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:14,257
Don't disappoint me.

394
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:36,346
<i>I wonder how Master's body is doing.</i>

395
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,336
<i>I should go take a look.</i>

396
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:50,916
Aunt, why are you awake?

397
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,227
I want to go see Master.

398
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,676
Are those documents that Ye Hua
had that immortal send over?

399
00:32:55,676 --> 00:33:00,317
Yes. I'm afraid that since Heavenly Lord
wants Crown Prince to succeed the throne

400
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,747
there are increasingly
more and more documents.

401
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,876
Because Crown Prince has been
taking care of you the past few days

402
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,096
he hasn't looked at any of his documents.

403
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:07,416
I just helped him organize them.

404
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,876
Where is Ye Hua?

405
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:11,176
He went back to the Celestial Palace.

406
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:13,757
I think he'll be back soon.

407
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,227
Go do your work.

408
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,576
I'm going to go to Yanhua Cave.

409
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:48,747
With Mi Gu here,
Master will get taken care of.

410
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:53,817
Master, 300 years ago

411
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:58,037
Zhe Yan told me that
you would wake up soon.

412
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:03,007
It's already been 300 years,
but you haven't moved at all.

413
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:07,727
I don't know if he's lying to me.

414
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:15,476
Every day I think about how
great it would be when you come back

415
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:20,847
and we get to reunite
with all the other disciples.

416
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:03,657
<i>No matter how I look at it,
Qing Qiu's scenery is still the best.</i>

417
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:08,577
<i>It's a pity that Ye Hua has been cooking
for us every day since he came to Fox Den</i>

418
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:11,036
<i>so I haven't gotten
a chance to take him around.</i>

419
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:54,987
Qian Qian.

420
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,226
Ye Hua. Ye Hua, you--

421
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:06,606
Ye Hua, what are you doing?

422
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:13,117
I thought you were going
to jump into the lake.

423
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:18,556
Because it's so hot, I--

424
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,617
Qian Qian.

425
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,657
I won't let you...

426
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:32,367
Weren't you going through
documents in your room?

427
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:36,427
Why are you here all of a sudden?

428
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,686
When Mi Gu went to give you your dinner,
he saw that you weren't there.

429
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:52,376
He told me, so I came out to find you.

430
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,677
Let's go back.

431
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,606
<i>Since coming back
from Grand Ziming Palace</i>

432
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,097
<i>he's never asked me about Master.</i>

433
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,496
<i>That's weird.</i>

434
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,547
Fifth Sister, did you drink?

435
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:26,987
Why are you so red?

436
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,976
The scenery in Qing Qiu is so nice

437
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:45,967
so I brought Crown Prince
here to look around.

438
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:51,077
The setting sun, the light breeze,
the fragrance of a lake full of lotus...

439
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:54,056
It really is a nice place to date.

440
00:37:57,177 --> 00:38:01,726
Bi Fang sent us a letter this afternoon
saying that you were beaten half dead.

441
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:04,717
Your fourth brother and I thought
this was a rare occurrence

442
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:09,117
and came back to see how
you were beaten half to death.

443
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:14,177
Last time when I was half dead,
I was a bit lacking in manners.

444
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,836
I got better on my own
without letting you see me.

445
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,137
I was really sorry about that.

446
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:23,586
Although I was heavily injured this time,
it wasn't that bad that I was half dead.

447
00:38:23,586 --> 00:38:26,577
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

448
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:29,177
Where's all this anger coming from?

449
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,547
Forget it. Forget it.

450
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:35,027
Since I've made you angry

451
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:39,586
I'll have to give you a treasured item
to alleviate your anger.

452
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:43,117
Here, I'll give you this fan.

453
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:46,427
It was painted by the Water King
of the West Sea himself.

454
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,067
You lucked out.

455
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:51,907
The old phoenix knows
to apologize with a gift.

456
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:53,887
You are very smart indeed.

457
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:57,177
But what did you two go to West Sea for?

458
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:59,617
A few days ago, we ran into
Second Prince of West Sea.

459
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:03,637
He said he wanted to ask Zhe Yan for
a favor, so we went to West Sea.

460
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:06,387
Senior needed something?

461
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:11,577
Oh? So you've told Ye Hua everything?

462
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:15,056
You've had us old fogeys
hide your connection to

463
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:18,556
Kunlun Mountain and all
those events all these years.

464
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,827
Now we don't have to lie anymore.

465
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:27,077
A while ago, Xuan Nu stole Master's body.

466
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:30,666
Ye Hua helped me bring him back.

467
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:33,086
Let's not talk about that now.

468
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:36,356
Your brother and I are quite tired
after coming back from West Sea.

469
00:39:36,356 --> 00:39:39,246
Why don't we go inside the fox den?

470
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,757
I didn't expect you to
get angry over words.

471
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,067
High God Zhe Yan sure is capable.

472
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:57,197
He's so much older than me.
It's okay to be angry with him.

473
00:39:57,197 --> 00:39:59,806
If a younger immortal
offended me through words

474
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,737
I wouldn't bicker over it.

475
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:04,456
I wish you would bicker
with me about everything.

476
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:06,317
What's there to bicker about with you?

477
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:08,126
Aunt!

478
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:11,876
Your Highness.

479
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,597
Ghost Lord Li Jing would like to see you.

480
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:18,067
He's already waited for
half the day at the entrance.

481
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,496
What does he want?

482
00:40:20,496 --> 00:40:22,907
What perfect timing.

483
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:26,547
What luck I have today. I just so
happen to be here when it's so lively.

484
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:30,306
Kick him out of the cave.

485
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:34,717
Huh? Aunt, he's waiting at the entrance.

486
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:35,916
He hasn't come inside.

487
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,836
Let him leave whenever he wants.

488
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,277
You have to resolve things.

489
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:44,356
Dragging things out will
just increase your worries.

490
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:48,036
Rather than finding another time,
why don't we just resolve things today?

491
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,097
What's there to resolve between
me and him?

492
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,356
Everything has already
been resolved long ago.

493
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:07,007
Since your fourth brother is back,
he has taken my study room.

494
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:12,356
I can't read my documents tonight,
so you'll have to play go with me.

495
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,746
I'll have Mi Gu pack
some clothes for you.

496
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,876
Come with me to
Celestial Palace tomorrow.

497
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:51,746
