1
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:04,464
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,365
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,504
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:09,815
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:15,088
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,025
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,299
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,410
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,631
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,498
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,735
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:38,521
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:42,196
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,616
Wait 'til you see it, Katara.
The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.

15
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:11,139
Aang, I know you're excited
but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.

16
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,821
That's why I'm so excited!

17
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,581
It's just that a lot can change in all that time..

18
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,542
I know.

19
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,462
but I need to see it for myself..

20
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,181
Wake up, Sokka!
Air Temple here we come!

21
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:29,748
Sleep now...
temple later...

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,470
Sokka! Wake up!
There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,988
Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh!

24
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,105
Great! You're awake. Let's go.

25
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,351
Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.

26
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,740
I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.

27
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,746
You mean the Avatar?
Don't mention his name on these docks!

28
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:04,699
Once word gets out that he's alive
every firebender will be out looking for him

29
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:06,630
and I don't want anyone getting in the way.

30
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,386
Getting in the way of what...

31
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,887
Prince Zuko?

32
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:12,988
Captain Zhao.
It's Commander now.

33
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:15,211
And General Iroh

34
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,276
Great hero of our nation.
Retired general.

35
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:21,949
The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time.

36
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,618
What brings you to my harbor?

37
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,979
Our ship is being repaired.

38
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,169
That's quite a bit of damage.

39
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,490
Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.

40
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,321
Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.

41
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,273
Yes, I will do that. It was what...did we crash or something??

42
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,103
Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

43
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:49,496
Really? You must regale me with all the thrilling details.

44
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,090
Join me for a drink?

45
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,755
Sorry, but we have to go.
Prince Zuko,

46
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,364
show Commander Zhao your respect.

47
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:02,300
We would be honored to join you.
Do you have any ginseng tea?

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,574
It's my favorite.

49
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:16,956
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?
I'm trying to find us some food.

50
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:26,065
Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?

51
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:30,874
Oh, that was food?
I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,941
ou WHAT?

53
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,750
Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good.

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,872
The Batola mountain range!

55
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,418
We're almost there!

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,633
Aang? Before we get to the temple,
I want to talk to you about the airbenders.

57
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,384
What about 'em?

58
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,183
Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see.

59
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,319
The Fire Nation is ruthless.

60
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:58,195
They killed my mother
and they could have done the same to your people.

61
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:02,348
Just because no one has seen an airbender
doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.

62
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,667
They probably escaped.
I know it's hard to accept.

63
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:10,215
You don't understand, Katara.
The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison

64
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:14,973
and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison.
Right, Appa?

65
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:16,724
Yip-yip!

66
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,173
There it is...
the Southern Air Temple.

67
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,340
Aang, it's amazing!

68
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,736
We're home, buddy. We're home.

69
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:49,782
And by year's end,
the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule.

70
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:53,204
The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.

71
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:57,963
If my father thinks the rest of the world
will follow him willingly, then he is a fool.

72
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,600
Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue.

73
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,428
So,

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,196
how is your search for the Avatar going?

75
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,087
My fault entirely.

76
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,667
We haven't found him yet.

77
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:17,120
Did you really expect to?
The Avatar died a hundred years ago

78
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:19,809
along with the rest of the airbenders.

79
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:23,553
Unless you found some evidence

80
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,929
that the Avatar is alive?
No. Nothing.

81
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,515
Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one

82
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,809
who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.

83
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,806
If you have an ounce of loyalty left,
you'll tell me what you've found.

84
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,198
I haven't found anything.

85
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,113
It's like you said.

86
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:44,231
The Avatar probably died a long time ago.

87
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:46,788
Come on, Uncle, we're going.

88
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,554
Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed.

89
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:52,699
They confirmed

90
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,717
Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody,
but let him escape.

91
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,469
Now, remind me...

92
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,966
.. how exactly was your ship damaged?

93
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,799
So where do I get something to eat?

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,096
You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders

95
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:20,206
to ever visit an airbender temple
and all you can think about is food?

96
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:24,041
I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.

97
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:26,696
So that's where my friends and I would play airball!

98
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:30,142
And... over there would be
where the bison would sleep... and...

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,248
What's wrong?

100
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,462
This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison.

101
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,546
Now there's just a bunch of weeds.

102
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:43,238
I can't believe how much things have changed.

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,519
So, uh,

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,767
this airball game? How do you play?

105
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:06,840
Hahaha! Aang seven, Sokka zero!

106
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,615
Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.

107
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:17,631
Katara, check this out.

108
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:19,954
Fire Nation.

109
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,706
We should tell him.

110
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,470
Aang, there's something you need to see.

111
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,221
Okay!

112
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,435
What is it?

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,316
Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned.

114
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,443
Nice one. But enough practicing.

115
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:41,053
We have a whole temple to see!

116
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,062
You know, you can't protect him forever.

117
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,219
Katara, firebenders were here.
You can't pretend they weren't.

118
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:56,001
I can for Aang's sake.

119
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:59,270
If he finds out that
the Fire Nation invaded his home

120
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,814
he'll be devastated.

121
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:01,901
Hey guys!

122
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:03,527
I want you to meet somebody.

123
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:04,695
Who's that?

124
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,400
Monk Gyatso,
the greatest airbender in the world.

125
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:11,484
He taught me everything I know.

126
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:17,800
But the true secret is in the gooey center!

127
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:23,978
My ancient cake making technique
isn't the only thing on your mind

128
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:27,465
...is it, Aang?
This whole Avatar thing...

129
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,987
maybe the monks made a mistake.

130
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:34,621
The only mistake they made was telling you
before you turned sixteen.

131
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,668
But we can't concern ourselves with what was.

132
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,004
We must act on what is.

133
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,021
But Gyatso,
how do I know if I'm ready for this?

134
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:51,316
Your questions will be answered
when you are old enough

135
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:54,382
to enter the Air Temple sanctuary.

136
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:59,456
Inside you will meet someone
who will guide you on your journey.

137
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,583
Who is it?

138
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,692
When you are ready he will reveal himself to you.

139
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,052
Now,

140
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:10,679
are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?

141
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,780
All right.

142
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,534
One...

143
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,285
two...three!

144
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:31,637
Your aim has improved greatly my young pupil.

145
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,382
You must miss him.

146
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,819
Yeah.
Where are you going?

147
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:44,293
The Air Temple Sanctuary.
There's someone I'm ready to meet.

148
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,147
But Aang... no one could have survived
in there for a hundred years.

149
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,305
It's not impossible.
I survived in the iceberg for that long.

150
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,476
Good point.

151
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:04,357
Katara, whoever's in there
might help me figure out this Avatar thing!

152
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,359
And whoever's in there might have
a medley of delicious,

153
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,842
cured meats!

154
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,975
I don't suppose you have a key?

155
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:18,536
The key, Sokka, is airbending.

156
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,291
Hello?

157
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,045
Anyone home?

158
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:07,386
So, a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders?

159
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,592
You're more pathetic than I thought.

160
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,437
I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again.

161
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,559
No, it will not, because you won't have a second chance.

162
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:16,522
Commander Zhao,

163
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:19,943
I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I...
And you failed!

164
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:23,781
Capturing the Avatar is too important
to leave in a teenager's hands.

165
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,535
He's mine now.

166
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,791
Keep them here.

167
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,780
More tea please?

168
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,217
Statues?! That's it? Where's the meat?

169
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:57,524
Who are all these people?
I'm not sure

170
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,053
but it feels like I know them somehow. Look!

171
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,596
That one's an airbender!

172
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:05,312
And this one's a waterbender.
They're lined up in a pattern.

173
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:08,045
Air, water, earth and fire.

174
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,153
That's the Avatar cycle.

175
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:15,371
Of course! They're Avatars.
All these people are your past lives, Aang.

176
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,678
Wow! There's so many!

177
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:24,721
Past lives? Katara,
you really believe in that stuff?

178
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,014
It's true. When the Avatar dies
he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

179
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,462
Aang, snap out of it!

180
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:42,040
Who is that?

181
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,967
That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.

182
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:49,227
You were a firebender?
No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.

183
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,057
There's no writing. How do you know his name?

184
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:53,394
I'm not sure...

185
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:55,145
I just know it somehow.

186
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,487
You just couldn't get any weirder!

187
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,341
Firebender. Nobody make a sound.

188
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,300
You're making a sound!

189
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:22,519
That firebender won't know what hit 'em.

190
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,307
Lemur!
Dinner

191
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,925
Don't listen to him! You're going to be my new pet.

192
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:38,981
Not if I get him first!

193
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,694
Wait! Come back!

194
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,603
I wanna eat you!

195
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,231
Hey! No Fair!

196
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:15,910
My search party is ready.

197
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,456
Once I'm out to sea,
my guards will escort you back to your ship

198
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,418
and you'll be free to go.

199
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,975
Why?
Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?

200
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:30,096
You? Stop me? Impossible.

201
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:34,555
Don't underestimate me, Zhao.
I will capture the Avatar before you.

202
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,568
Prince Zuko, that's enough!

203
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,625
You can't compete with me.

204
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:42,102
I have hundreds of warships under my command,

205
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,793
and you... you're just a banished prince.

206
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:49,378
No home. No allies.
Your own father doesn't even want you.

207
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,969
You're wrong.

208
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,974
Once I deliver the Avatar to my father
he will welcome me home with honor

209
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:57,547
and restore my rightful place on the throne.

210
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,157
If your father really wanted you home,

211
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:04,324
he'd have let you return by now,
Avatar or no Avatar

212
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:08,539
but in his eyes you are a failure
and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.

213
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,083
That's not true.

214
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,352
You have the scar to prove it.

215
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,425
Maybe you'd like one to match!

216
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:17,331
Is that a challenge?
An agni kai. .

217
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,082
At sunset

218
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,102
Very well.

219
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:25,151
It's a shame your father
won't be here to watch me humiliate you.

220
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:27,044
I guess your uncle will do.

221
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:32,655
Prince Zuko, have you forgotten
what happened last time you dueled a master?

222
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,242
I will never forget.

223
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:43,303
Hey! Come back!

224
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,270
Come on out, little lemur.

225
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,641
That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.

226
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:53,891
Firebenders? They were here?

227
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,455
Gyatso...

228
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:07,723
Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet?

229
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,894
Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur,

230
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,436
okay?

231
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,186
Oh, man...

232
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:17,514
come on, Aang, everything will be all right.
Let's get out of here.

233
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,602
Aang!

234
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:49,169
Send word to the Fire Lord immediately.

235
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,198
The Avatar has returned!

236
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,145
Aang! Come on,

237
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,898
snap out of it!

238
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:16,088
What happened?
He found out firebenders killed Gyatso.

239
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,540
Oh no, it's his avatar spirit!

240
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:22,953
He must have triggered it!
I'm gonna try and calm him down.

241
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,957
Well, do it before he blows us off the mountain!

242
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,926
Remember your firebending basics,

243
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:46,562
Prince Zuko.
They are your greatest weapons.

244
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,149
I refuse to let him win.

245
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,024
This will be over quickly.

246
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,285
Basics, Zuko!

247
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,738
Break his root!

248
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,719
Do it!

249
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:30,223
That's it?
Your father raised a coward.

250
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:34,914
Next time you get in my way,
I promise I won't hold back.

251
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:51,886
No, Prince Zuko.
Do not taint your victory.

252
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:56,018
So this is how the great
Commander Zhao acts in defeat.

253
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,770
Disgraceful.

254
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:03,432
Even in exile my nephew is more honorable than you.

255
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,209
Thanks again for the tea.

256
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,593
It was delicious.

257
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,794
Did you really mean that, Uncle?

258
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:19,332
Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.

259
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:26,911
Aang, I know you're upset...

260
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:31,143
... and I know how hard it is
to lose the people you love.

261
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:35,214
I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.

262
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:39,387
Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone,

263
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,541
but you still have a family.

264
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,704
Sokka and I, we're your family now.

265
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:58,961
Katara and I aren't going to let anything
happen to you. Promise.

266
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:07,102
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.

267
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,607
But you were right.

268
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:13,013
And if firebenders found this temple
that means they found the other ones, too.

269
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,860
I really am the last airbender.

270
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:25,837
Everything's packed. You ready to go?

271
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,393
How is Roku supposed to help me
if I can't talk to him?

272
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:31,686
Maybe you'll find a way.

273
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:44,009
Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka.

274
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,444
Can't talk. Must eat.

275
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,381
Hey little guy.

276
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:53,742
You, me, and Appa.

277
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:58,408
We're all that's left of this place.
We have to stick together.

278
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,460
Katara, Sokka...

279
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,642
... say hello to the newest member of our family.

280
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,868
What are you going to name him?

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,750
Momo.
