1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,100
First Storm

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Why?

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,900
Why did my face get so hot?

19
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,100
Why did my heart beat so fast?

20
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,400
My face is hot.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
How weird...

22
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm so pissed!

23
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
The boys in class 4 are slacking on the culture festival preparations

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
and ranking the first year girls in beauty!

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,800
They should look in the mirror, before talking.

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Sounds like fun!

27
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,100
We should do a boys ranking too, Nanoka.

28
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,900
Na-no-ka!

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,700
Why are you so out of it?

30
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
Who's your top choice of the boys?

31
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't really know the boys in the other classes.

32
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
How about Miyauchi?

33
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
I heard you went home with him the other day!

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
When did you get so close to him?

35
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,620
Yeah, when?

36
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,030
That's not it!

37
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,270
That day, we had to stay late to finish up some executive committee work!

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,810
The way you desperately defend yourself makes it even more suspicious.

39
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,300
That's not it!

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sorry. It must be embarrassing for you.

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,800
Everyone... everyone's just kidding around.

42
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,600
Its fine. I don't really mind.

43
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Hey... would you read this later?

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This?

45
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
It's something like a love letter.

46
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,800
But... I just spoke to you for the first time the other day... It's so sudden...

47
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,600
It's not from me.

48
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
It's from this guy named Asano in my class.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,100
Oh... It is... I see...

50
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,400
but it doesn't mean I dislike you, Miyauchi-kun.

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
How should I put this... umm...

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Then, please take care of it.

53
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,800
Well he doesn't look like a bad guy.

54
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,900
I think he's nice, though he has a pretty plain face.

55
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Hey, Nanoka, come here too!

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,900
Hey, let's stop spying on him.

57
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,600
So you say, but it actually bothers you, right?

58
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
Why don't you go talk to him?

59
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
He's probably just playing around with me.

60
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm sure that's not true.

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,900
Umm...

62
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,600
Why did you run away? It was your chance to talk to him!

63
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah.

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,500
But there's always tomorrow.

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
You're going to look around the festival with him, right?

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,500
But...

67
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,900
Try going out with him for a day, and see if you want to go out with him for real after that.

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,100
But... but what... do you do when you ''go out'' with someone?

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Well, there's a whole bunch of things!

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,900
Like walk home together, visit each others houses or walk through a park...

71
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,900
A park?

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Maybe if you get a boyfriend you'll be able to grow out of your brother complex.

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't have a brother complex!

74
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
What's wrong?

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,500
Umm... About tomorrow's culture festival...

76
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
I don't mind if you come too, brother...

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Sorry, I have to work.

78
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
What is it?

79
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
You don't look happy.

80
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
That's not true.

81
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,500
Brother, you won't get mad?

82
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,300
He doesn't seem like a bad person, but the letter seems so easygoing...

83
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,800
I was thinking that maybe he's just making fun of me.

84
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,500
I shouldn't go out with a boy I've never even talked to before, right?

85
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
I don't really know this boy very well...

86
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,100
So he's saying you should try hanging out with him.

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Futaba-chan said the same thing.

88
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,500
Don't show me letters like this.

89
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,400
It may look like he's just being casual but he might be pretty serious.

90
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,400
Should you show such important letters so casually to a third person?

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,900
I just wanted to talk to someone about it

92
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
because I don't know what to do!

93
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,900
So, if he doesn't seem like a bad guy, try going out with him once.

94
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
So, if he doesn't seem like a bad guy, try going out with him once.

95
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,800
And if you think you guys would click, go out with him.

96
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,800
Maybe it'll go well.

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Is it okay?

98
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
Don't ask me such things...

99
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,600
But... you got really mad the other time when Miyauchi-kun just walked me home.

100
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm sorry about that. I won't treat you like a kid anymore.

101
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,200
Do as you like.

102
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,400
I see. I guess you're right.

103
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,200
It's my own problem. I can decide on my own.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,500
Thanks for listening to me.

105
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
That's right.

106
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Besides... my brother... has nothing to do with it.

107
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,200
Umm... I can't really think about going out with anyone right now...

108
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,200
I was just thinking that it'd be cool if we could hang out together, today.

109
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
But...

110
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Is there someone else you like?

111
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,400
No... it's not like that!

112
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Don't worry about it. I don't really mind.

113
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm actually kind of busy with my class haunted house.

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,700
I have to go back now!

115
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Looks like I've troubled you, sorry!

116
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm the one that has to apologize...

117
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Do as you like.

118
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Huh?

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
Weird...

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
That's weird...

121
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,750
A photo of my brother?

122
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,950
You don't have one?

123
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,750
He ended up not coming to the culture festival, so...

124
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,250
I want to see what kind of prince this brother you're always talking about looks like.

125
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,550
No. He isn't very good looking.

126
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,650
His beard is all bushy and he kind of smells like an old man.

127
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,450
He smells bad? What does he smell like? A weird smell?

128
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,950
Can you put this in the wash?

129
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,350
Eh? Does it smell that bad?

130
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,950
It doesn't really stink, but...

131
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,950
The scores are 3 runs apart.

132
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,950
Bottom of the 9th with 2 outs.

133
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,450
Runners on 1st and 3rd base.

134
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,750
The batter is Yoshimura.

135
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,650
Today, he's 2 for 4.

136
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,050
If he hits a home run, the score will be tied but-

137
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,450
It's hit hard, down the first base line and... it's foul.

138
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,850
It had the distance, but it sliced right.

139
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,150
The closer, Ueda, is warming up in the bullpen...

140
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,050
but the manager, Oomori, shows no move.

141
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,050
2nd pitch, he hits it!

142
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,050
He hits a line drive straight into right field!

143
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,550
The runner on 3rd comes home.

144
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,250
Runner on 1st rounds 3rd and heads for home.

145
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,350
Brother...

146
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,250
Will you help me with my homework?

147
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,050
No. It's too troublesome.

148
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,750
Why?

149
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,250
I forgot what I studied in high school.

150
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,550
Stop staring at me!

151
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,050
I wasn't staring.

152
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,950
You're making me lose my concentration.

153
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,050
All you have to do for that one is put it in the equation.

154
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,050
Oh... I knew that!

155
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,450
That's so not cute.

156
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,150
Then how about this one?

157
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,350
Look over it carefully.

158
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,650
At what?

159
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,150
You messed up on the first calculation for this one.

160
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,750
Oh. I see. I do that a lot.

161
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,750
No way... The homework was due today?

162
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,650
Nanoka!

163
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,650
You're so hopeless.

164
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,250
I won't make it on time! The teacher's going to come!

165
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:39,250
If Futaba-chan and the others saw my brother... what would they say?

166
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,550
I wonder if my brother is handsome or not?

167
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,050
Later.

168
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,250
That's early!

169
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,150
Is your sister making a home made dinner for you?

170
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,250
Yeah.

171
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,650
He's now unperturbed even when I bring up his younger sister.

172
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,050
My brother always looks disgruntled, and I don't really know what goes on in his mind.

173
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,850
He's mean and grumpy,

174
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,350
and yet sometimes he's nice...

175
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,050
and it surprises me.

176
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,550
Idiot! That's dangerous!

177
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,850
Sorry...

178
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,950
So umm..

179
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,650
How'd it go with that guy who wrote you the letter?

180
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,850
Did you have fun at the culture festival?

181
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,250
If you have something on your mind, feel free to talk to me.

182
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,150
Oh... that...

183
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,450
Like, if you don't know how to go out with him or...

184
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,950
if you're having a hard time with things like that.

185
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,850
I turned him down.

186
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,750
Oh... you did?

187
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,250
Yeah.

188
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,650
What? Did you worry about me?

189
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,550
Not really.

190
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,150
You were concerned about me?

191
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,650
No I said!

192
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,250
Besides, it's 10 years too early for you to be getting a guy.

193
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,850
You said you wouldn't treat me like a kid any more.

194
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,050
What kind of adult would swing a bag around so much?

195
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,450
Were you following me the whole way?

196
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,350
Are you kidding me?

197
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,450
I just saw you on top of that hill and...

198
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,450
How sick! You were looking at me secretly and laughing!

199
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,350
I wasn't laughing.

200
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,350
I think it's fine, something Nanoka would do.

201
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,950
You just called me Nanoka for the first time...

202
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,350
R-Really?

203
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,850
Yeah! You always say "hey you" so condescendingly!

204
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,150
I'm not really being condescending.

205
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,050
I'm always the one that gets surprised...

206
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,750
It's unfair...

207
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
I don't know what you're saying.

208
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,150
I...

209
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,550
I love you brother.

210
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,350
What are you saying!?

211
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,950
I didn't mean it like that!

212
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,450
What do yo mean?

213
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,850
You're weird... blushing like that! So weird!

214
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,350
I know...

215
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,350
I'm going ahead!

216
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,150
What is she saying...?

217
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,550
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

218
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,580
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

219
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,480
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

220
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,950
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

221
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,040
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

222
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,440
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

223
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,020
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

224
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,270
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

225
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,710
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

226
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:34,510
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

227
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,920
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

228
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,290
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

229
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,790
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

230
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,910
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

231
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,700
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

232
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,370
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

233
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,190
I don't have a brother complex, but consulting my brother about the love letter I got...

234
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,160
Do I really have a brother complex?

235
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,920
Punishment of brother complex!
