1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,003
Unforgivable! He is the number one
enemy of all junior high girls!

2
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:09,302
Impure fraternization!
It's just unforgivable!

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:12,834
For the crime of staining everyone's
favorite hangout with evil...

4
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:19,382
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

6
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

7
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,313
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

8
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:14,753
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

9
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

10
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

11
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

13
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:49,152
I believe in it, miracle romance

14
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,529
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

15
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:00,273
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

16
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:02,408
and fight against bad guys.

17
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:06,572
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:12,109
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

19
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:15,655
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

20
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:18,317
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

21
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,791
But anyway, I just have
to do my best!

22
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:31,963
Usagi is Frantic! Rei's First Date

23
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:42,148
It's a nice and quiet place.

24
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:44,582
Yup! Perfect for a date!

25
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,452
So, do you like it?

26
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:49,478
I'm a bit surprised you
know of a place like this.

27
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,991
Really? I always come here to read

28
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,323
when I don't have cram school.

29
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,901
Mr. Kunitachi.

30
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:05,770
Oh, Ami.

31
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:13,173
So, you take care of this
big park all by yourself?

32
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,315
Well, that will be coming
to an end soon.

33
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:17,782
What?

34
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:24,689
The land owner sold this park,

35
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:27,622
and it's apparently being turned
into a business district.

36
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:32,932
I had no idea.

37
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:36,766
When this park is gone, the birds and
animals will have nowhere to go.

38
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,005
It's troubling.

39
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,371
And it's such a nice park, too.

40
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,075
Well, there is nothing
I can do about it.

41
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:55,988
All right! I'm going to bring a
boyfriend here before it's gone.

42
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,853
Jubancho
Shopping District

43
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:08,092
Where has everyone gone today?!

44
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:24,138
Are you okay?

45
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,486
You don't look hurt.

46
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,658
What are you doing to my Luna?!

47
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,660
If she's your cat, keep
a better eye on her!

48
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,128
She almost got run over!

49
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,426
None of your business!

50
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,359
Luna isn't like your everyday
ordinary cat!

51
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,571
Stop it, Usagi.

52
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,674
That's right. He saved Luna,
so you should thank him.

53
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:49,041
Yeah, yeah.
That's right. He saved Luna,
so you should thank him.

54
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:49,809
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:50,009
Yeah, yeah.
Why are you both taking his side?!

56
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,944
Why are you both taking his side?!

57
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:53,411
Hey.

58
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:54,814
It's you, Chiba.

59
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:55,114
Yo, Motoki.
It's you, Chiba.

60
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,342
Yo, Motoki.

61
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,317
Motoki...

62
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,019
You know him?

63
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,385
Yeah, we both go to
the same college.

64
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,080
You're...

65
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,155
...a college student?!

66
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,774
The stars know everything.

67
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:30,607
O stars, grant me your
mysterious powers.

68
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,663
The beta star of Cygnus, Albireo,

69
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:47,223
is noticeably brighter
again after 120 years.

70
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,671
So, this is the man who will
be influenced by Albireo

71
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:54,605
and reach his peak energy level.

72
00:05:56,876 --> 00:06:00,334
I shall take the greatest
energy of his life from him.

73
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:08,610
Shoot! Okay, another 100 yen!

74
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,423
Are you sure it's okay to
waste so much money?

75
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:10,956
Oh, don't worry about it.
Are you sure it's okay to
waste so much money?

76
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:11,724
Oh, don't worry about it.

77
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:15,592
Wow. So, Mamoru lives by himself?

78
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:18,330
Yeah, in an expensive
high-rise apartment.

79
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,025
After all, he is the son of a rich family.

80
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,568
If he goes to the same
college as you,

81
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,093
he goes to that really competitive
school, right?

82
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,200
Yeah, I suppose.

83
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,501
But, Rei, why are you asking
so much about him?

84
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:33,639
Oh, no reason!

85
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:40,242
Mamoru Chiba. He and I would be
a perfect match for each other.

86
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:42,420
I've decided!

87
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:46,583
I will go on a date with
Mamoru in that park!

88
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:54,561
Okay, this'll be the last time!

89
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,168
Are you okay, Rei?

90
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:56,769
I'm done for!
Are you okay, Rei?

91
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,168
I'm done for!

92
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,573
I wish there was some way
to protect this nature.

93
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,508
You will protect it.

94
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,250
What?

95
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,410
Who are you?

96
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:19,580
People have forgotten the boon
that nature bestows upon them.

97
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:25,021
It is time for you to teach those
conceited humans the wrath of nature.

98
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,998
Me?

99
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,700
That's right.

100
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,668
You.

101
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,611
My loyal monster,

102
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:49,546
possess this hat and take
this man's energy!

103
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:23,950
You will teach the humans
the wrath of nature. You.

104
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:40,567
What are these?! Help!

105
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,509
By using the power of the monster,

106
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:53,775
you can control the animals
and insects at will.

107
00:08:56,055 --> 00:09:00,151
The more you use that power, the
more your energy will increase.

108
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,904
According to what Motoki told me,

109
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:14,839
he's supposed to come
this way after school.

110
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,513
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,640
I wasn't looking where I was going.

112
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:27,117
Not at all. I should have
paid more attention, too.

113
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,283
If you don't mind, I'll take you
out for tea as an apology.

114
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:34,226
My! All right, I will join you.

115
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:35,693
Good.

116
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:37,630
Oh, it would be nice.

117
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,864
For cake or bread,
come to our shop!
Juban Bakery
Oh, it would be nice.

118
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:39,398
For cake or bread,
come to our shop!
Juban Bakery

119
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:42,134
For cake or bread,
come to our shop!
Juban Bakery
I'll bump into him on purpose and
make an opportunity for myself!

120
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,632
Sheesh! You're going to
gain weight again!

121
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,598
This is nothing!

122
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,437
Oh, it's Rei!

123
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:53,142
You're right. I wonder
what she's doing?

124
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:58,749
Here he comes.

125
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,323
Now!

126
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,417
Are you okay?!

127
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:13,132
I don't know what she was doing,

128
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:14,833
but Rei's pretty clumsy.

129
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,630
Speak for yourself.

130
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:18,699
I'm all right.

131
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,404
Okay, glad to hear it.

132
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,273
What?!

133
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,509
Excuse me...

134
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,013
Oh? You're that dumpling
head's friend.

135
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:31,574
Yes. My name is Rei Hino.
Please just call me, Rei.

136
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,550
Are you okay?

137
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:37,580
Sure, I'm fine, but...

138
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,356
I'm sorry. I will take you out
for tea to make up for this.

139
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,093
To make up for what?

140
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,155
Oh, well...

141
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,333
For making you step on my head.

142
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,768
What?

143
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:52,601
Well, okay. I won't mind
having tea with you.

144
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:54,406
Really?!

145
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:54,640
Yeah.
Really?!

146
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,708
Yeah.

147
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:55,908
Yeah.
Well, everything turned
out okay in the end.

148
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:58,274
Well, everything turned
out okay in the end.

149
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,314
What the hell is he doing?!

150
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,806
He's a college student and he's
walking arm-in-arm with Rei!

151
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:10,281
Usagi, I don't think Mamoru is
such a bad person, you know.

152
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:13,889
Don't be silly! That's
impure fraternization!

153
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,563
Even the student guide says
that's absolutely wrong!

154
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:21,329
Anyway, Rei's in danger!
We're following them!

155
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:26,495
Sheesh. She's just jealous,
plain and simple.

156
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,393
Excuse me...

157
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,029
Would you like some sugar?

158
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:50,497
No thanks, I'm fine.
Would you like some sugar?

159
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,623
No thanks, I'm fine.

160
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,594
Oh, of course not!

161
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,523
Then I won't either.

162
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,869
I wonder what they're talking about?

163
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,543
I wish I could go in.

164
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:06,212
It's your fault for spending all
your money on ice cream.

165
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,782
I know! I'll transform into
a waitress and...

166
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,183
No, you can't!

167
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:11,117
Why not?

168
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:11,684
Because you're supposed
to use that for justice!
Why not?

169
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,887
Because you're supposed
to use that for justice!

170
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,288
Oh, come on! Just for a little while!

171
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:15,688
Miss Usagi!
Oh, come on! Just for a little while!

172
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:16,245
Miss Usagi!

173
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:18,991
What are you doing?

174
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,792
Umino...

175
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:27,801
Umino, do you have any
money on you?

176
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,325
Yes, I do...

177
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,672
Then how about going on a
date with me right now?

178
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:35,041
What?! Really?!

179
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,168
I can't keep up with the
way she thinks.

180
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,113
Mamoru, I know of a
really nice place.

181
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:44,545
Would you like to go there with me?

182
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,610
Sure, I don't mind.

183
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:48,353
Really?!

184
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,751
Everything is going
according to plan.

185
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,923
Shoot! I can't hear them
from here either.

186
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,237
Ami.

187
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,606
Luna!

188
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,202
What's wrong? You don't
look very cheerful.

189
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,047
Yeah...

190
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,518
Well...

191
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,320
It seems the construction company

192
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,220
that was working on
the park just left.

193
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:25,282
As a result, the park will
stay as it is for now.

194
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:30,257
So, we would like you to continue
to be the park's caretaker.

195
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,461
What? The caretaker of this park?

196
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:39,297
Yes. He was the same
until yesterday, but...

197
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,175
You should not come to this park
without good reason from now on.

198
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:46,939
You people don't deserve to
enjoy the boons of nature.

199
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,947
I wonder what happened to him?

200
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:54,252
That construction company is pitiful!

201
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:58,048
There's no way animals and insects
would interfere with the construction!

202
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,035
What?! What are these?!

203
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:12,839
What's going on?

204
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,538
I'll never do anything to this
park again! Forgive me!

205
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:22,815
This place is filled with
a powerful evil aura!

206
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:23,983
What?!

207
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:24,317
This must be the work of
the Dark Kingdom!
What?!

208
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,478
This must be the work of
the Dark Kingdom!

209
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,387
Oh, no.

210
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,552
Then Mr. Kunitachi could also be...

211
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,121
I didn't know there was a
park like this in this city.

212
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:39,528
But this park is going to
be torn down soon.

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,025
I heard they're turning it
into a business district.

214
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,804
I see.

215
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:49,238
It's such a nice park surrounded
by beautiful nature.

216
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,204
You think so too, Mamoru?

217
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:56,611
Yes. People should think about
taking better care of nature.

218
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,118
Mamoru...

219
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,355
What could they be chatting about?!

220
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:08,424
I'll just have to get closer to them.

221
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:11,264
Usagi, you're too bold.

222
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,066
This is not the place for...

223
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,035
We should have a pure relationship,
like good junior high kids.

224
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:19,232
But maybe a kiss wouldn't hurt!

225
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:22,065
Huh? Where did you go, Miss Usagi?!

226
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,144
Usagi!

227
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:27,981
Oh, so you're both here, too.

228
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:30,575
We can't leave those
two alone after all.

229
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,149
Don't be ridiculous!

230
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:37,149
Usagi, something terrible is going
on in this park right now!

231
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:38,658
Something terrible?

232
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:38,925
You guys again!
Something terrible?

233
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,119
You guys again!

234
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:42,295
Mr. Kunitachi!

235
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:42,628
Foolish humans!
Mr. Kunitachi!

236
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:43,959
Foolish humans!

237
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,760
You people forgot the boon that
nature provided you with,

238
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:51,896
and the only way you can atone
for it is with your deaths!

239
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,997
The energy level has peaked!

240
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,798
Do it, Petasos!

241
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:19,331
Mr. Kunitachi...

242
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,501
All animals in this park,
massacre the humans!

243
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:29,930
Unforgivable! Mercury Power Makeup!

244
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:45,425
Usagi, don't just stand there!

245
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:46,826
I know that!

246
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:50,660
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

247
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:33,730
Mamoru, what is wrong?

248
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,239
What's this?!

249
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,077
What are these?!

250
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,554
Oh, help me!

251
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,886
Bubble

252
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,262
Spray!

253
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:04,637
The animals have been weakened!

254
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,002
Prepare yourself!

255
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:08,364
Mercury's on a roll!

256
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,269
Then I will use... Hand Flower!

257
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:14,412
Watch out!

258
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:16,449
Sailor Moon!

259
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:18,076
Petasos Rope!

260
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:23,221
Are you okay?

261
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:27,860
Yes, I am. But you weren't
feeling well...

262
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,623
Oh, it was nothing serious.

263
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,329
All right.

264
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,531
I sense a powerful evil aura.

265
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:40,072
Mamoru, stay here!
I'll be right back!

266
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:46,811
Sailor Mercury!

267
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,206
I will squeeze you to death first.

268
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:57,414
Mr. Kunitachi...

269
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:04,963
I can't forgive you!

270
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,698
I can't forgive you!

271
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,001
Fire Soul!

272
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,705
Hot! Hot! Hot!

273
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:17,043
Are you okay?

274
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:17,710
Can't you help me in a better way?
Are you okay?

275
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,371
Can't you help me in a better way?

276
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,982
Is that any way to talk to someone
who just rescued you?!

277
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:26,042
I see. So, she's the one who
interrupted my date.

278
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,021
I can't forgive you for taking advantage
of Mr. Kunitachi's feelings!

279
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:34,751
You'll pay a heavy price for staining
everyone's favorite hangout with evil.

280
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:39,622
In the name of the moon,
we will punish you!

281
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,931
Hey, that's my line!

282
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,173
Fine, then! I'll take care of all
three of you together!

283
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,945
Tuxedo Mask!

284
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,490
Now's your chance, Sailor Moon!

285
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:07,692
Yes!

286
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,600
Moon Tiara Action!

287
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,091
Good-bye, sailor warriors!

288
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:54,763
He's so dreamy.

289
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:59,009
Ami, what have I been doing?

290
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,140
It's okay now. Don't worry. You
were just having a bad dream.

291
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:08,310
Good grief. That was awful.

292
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:11,522
Mamoru! Is it okay for
you to get up?

293
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:13,955
Yeah, I'm completely fine now.

294
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,464
Maybe Mamoru really is Tuxedo Mask.

295
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,661
There's no way this guy
can be Tuxedo Mask!

296
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,664
Huh? What's this Tuxedo Mask?

297
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,767
Oh, no, it's nothing at all.

298
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,477
He has to be! Mamoru is
surely Tuxedo Mask.

299
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,147
Oh, Miss Usagi!

300
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:37,149
Oh, Umino...

301
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:38,884
I looked everywhere for you.

302
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,079
Now, let us continue our date.

303
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,782
Umino, don't go making up stories!

304
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:51,958
What are you talking about?
You're the one who asked me out!

305
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:54,763
Really? Good going.

306
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,501
That's not it!

307
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,334
I'm telling you, it's not!

308
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:13,841
In my dream, you and I were together

309
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:20,753
Protected by the stars

310
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:35,970
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

311
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:43,108
And we casually talked to each other

312
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,920
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

313
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:58,854
I want to become prettier
right here and now

314
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:06,393
Something changes when
you fall in love

315
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:12,972
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

316
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:26,858
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
