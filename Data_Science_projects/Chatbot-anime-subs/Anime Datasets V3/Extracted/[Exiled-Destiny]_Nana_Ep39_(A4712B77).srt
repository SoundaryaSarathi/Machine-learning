1
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:05,122
The news was not of
some severe situation

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:08,382
that would cause people to frown,
or at all serious in nature.

3
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:13,432
But it was a sudden live coverage
on a peaceful morning

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:16,232
of a scandal involving one singer
with too much makeup.

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,892
It made a great impression,
and I figured we had a chance.

6
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,602
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

7
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,472
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

8
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:35,322
Baby I'm standing alone

9
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:38,112
An unforgettable rainy day

10
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:41,122
Chasing after your shadow

11
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,992
And it's over, it's like sand now

12
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,292
I sigh every night

13
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,332
I scream like a child and cried

14
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,072
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

15
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:56,132
Please, please God, forgive my sins

16
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,872
I don't need to hide no more

17
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,812
Flowing toward the turquoise light

18
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,852
Just keep going on

19
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,452
You've got the chance now

20
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:08,652
You've got the power

21
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,152
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

22
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:12,792
I show you my life now

23
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,222
I show you my love now

24
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:17,452
I show you my everything yeah yeah

25
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:19,692
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

26
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:22,502
Don't ever change so be yourself

27
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:23,932
I'll show you my strength now

28
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,302
I'll show you my love now

29
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,572
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

30
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:32,602
Baby don't be afraid

31
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:36,242
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

32
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:38,942
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

33
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,722
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

34
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:44,622
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

35
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,832
Hey, did you watch it?
This morning's Morning Seven?

36
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:00,232
I did. Nana.

37
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,042
Who's that?

38
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,272
Ren's girl.

39
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,462
What? What kind of girl?

40
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,942
She pisses me off.

41
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:07,012
But she was really pretty, wasn't she?!

42
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:08,942
You think? Her gaze was too strong.

43
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,142
Maybe she put a curse on me.

44
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:10,902
A curse?

45
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:12,752
Girls nowadays are amazing.

46
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:14,052
I mean, using a man to become famous?

47
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,182
I can't forgive her. She deceived Ren.

48
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,322
Oh, you're a fan of Ren Honjo?

49
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:20,252
Me too, ever since that
canned coffee commercial.

50
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,762
That bass player was so cool.

51
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:24,562
Never mind Nana,
what's his name?

52
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,062
The bassist? I wanna know
the name of the guitarist.

53
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,992
What is it?
What's the band's name?

54
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,032
Try making your
own flowers bloom.

55
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:32,162
Boss, I don't understand
what you're saying.

56
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:36,132
- Hello, this is Gaia Records.
- We're terribly sorry.

57
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:37,912
- The release date for their debut single
- We will make an official announcement

58
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,242
- hasn't been determined yet.
- once the details have been worked out.

59
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,672
We have no choice but to do it,
Mr. Kawano.

60
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,522
In response to all the calls,

61
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:51,682
every department is set on
going ahead with this now.

62
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:53,852
This is no joke.

63
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,782
If we promote them because of this now,
it would be nothing but a set up.

64
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:58,432
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE THE
ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,692
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE THE
ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART
When this magazine goes
on sale tomorrow,

66
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,662
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE THE
ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART
Nana will be under more fire.

67
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:02,922
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE THE
ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART

68
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:07,172
Talented musicians getting their careers
destroyed by relentless slander

69
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,902
and record companies
who care only about profit.

70
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:12,212
You've seen it before,
haven't you, Matsuo?

71
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:16,242
But all your efforts to this point
would be wasted

72
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:17,472
if they replaced you with
another manager.

73
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,242
I say don't go against it
and just do as the agency says.

74
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:26,612
That proper way of thinking will
only be shunned by our superiors.

75
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:30,762
The fact that you weren't informed
of this incident ahead of time

76
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:31,732
is proof of that.

77
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:35,962
Anyone in this industry can
easily figure out

78
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,902
that our agency was involved
with that broadcast.

79
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,762
And the media grabbed onto
this scoop knowing that fact.

80
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:50,242
The party has already started.
There's no turning back now.

81
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,852
He's taking me lightly,
that raccoon man!

82
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,252
Such a cheap hotel?!

83
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,482
He should have gotten a suite
or a deluxe room!

84
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,062
I totally agree. This is too rude.

85
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,822
You think so? I think we're fortunate
they decided to protect us.

86
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:11,932
But they could've at least put us
in a hotel with room service.

87
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,292
I'm hungry.

88
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:14,932
Want me to go and buy something?

89
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:15,832
Sushi!

90
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,032
Got it!

91
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,272
I'm going then!

92
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:23,782
Misato?

93
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:27,142
Welcome back, Yasu.
How were things at Gaia?

94
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:28,842
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,152
She saw the TV show this morning
and got worried,

96
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:32,452
so she rushed over here.

97
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:33,892
What a girl.

98
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,252
But I'm relieved to see that
you're looking well, Nana.

99
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,092
How did you know we were
in this hotel?

100
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,452
Shin emailed me to let me know.

101
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,222
How thoughtful of you.

102
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,502
I knew she would come.

103
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,232
Misato says she'll be
staying here for a while.

104
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,712
She can run errands for us,

105
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,762
since we're not allowed
to go anywhere.

106
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,642
I'm in room 712.

107
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,602
Feel free to call me for anything.

108
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,142
But what about school?

109
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:00,842
No need to worry about that.

110
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:03,652
Then here you are.

111
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,312
It's a present from
Mr. Nishimoto at Gaia.

112
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:09,362
Misato, would you mind
eating my share?

113
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,652
All right! Food!

114
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:12,722
I couldn't do that.

115
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:13,652
No, really.

116
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,762
Actually I just had lunch
with Mr. Kawano, so I'm not hungry.

117
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,502
There's no need to hold back.

118
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,092
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry for always being a burden.

119
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:22,942
Make me some tea.

120
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,772
Say, who is this Nishimoto?

121
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,502
He's the general manager of
the production department.

122
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:28,812
He came to see us at the studio once.

123
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,082
Oh, right.

124
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,482
But so many people came
to see us,

125
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,882
so I don't remember them all.

126
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,122
What kind of person is he?

127
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,982
He looks like a fox.

128
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:38,842
A fox...

129
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,952
Gaia has too many shady guys!

130
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,682
Nana, it's super fancy sushi!

131
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:52,692
Nishimoto's a great guy.

132
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:57,872
But for someone in his position
to treat us to an expensive meal...

133
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,572
Is it almost decided?
Your debut?

134
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,382
Yeah. I guess they feel
they could make a few bucks

135
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:03,902
on the present exposure we're getting.

136
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,302
That fox sure is predictable.

137
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,002
Congratulations.

138
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,812
But there's no need to
push yourself, Nana.

139
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:16,352
If you don't feel like doing this,
you simply don't sign the contract.

140
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,082
Oh, that's right.
Sorry for getting carried away.

141
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:22,752
What are you saying?
We've gotta do this.

142
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,292
I threw my stupid pride away already.

143
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,032
Now that it's come to this,

144
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:29,562
I'm gonna take advantage of
you any way I can, Ren Honjo.

145
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,472
I'll make it big in this world,

146
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,702
no matter what dirty tricks
I must use to get there.

147
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,842
I'll become so big,
no one will be able to talk back to me!

148
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,942
Nana, you're awesome!

149
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,152
- Awesome! Awesome!
- Did you just realize that?

150
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,842
- Awesome!
- I can't use chopsticks...

151
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:46,042
Where's Nobu?

152
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,122
He's apparently locked himself
in his room.

153
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,922
Those rich boys are so weak.

154
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,792
I SAW YOU ON TV!
COOL! ARE YOU GONNA
BECOME FAMOUS?
GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

155
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,902
NANA IS SO PRETTY.
INTRODUCE HER TO ME.
I'D LOVE TO BE DECEIVED
BY A GIRL LIKE THAT!

156
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,902
WHAT'S HACHIKO?
NANA'S PET DOG?

157
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,912
You can't break me
with food anymore!

158
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:18,322
No. The food's done nothing wrong.
Eat it.

159
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:27,382
I'm not at all happy that our debut
was decided in this way.

160
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:30,302
I'm surprised Nana's going
along with it.

161
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,232
Where has her pride gone?

162
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:37,332
Overcoming adversities is her pride.

163
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,272
But I have my pride too.

164
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,742
In the end, Gaia could care less
about our sound.

165
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,782
Is this what a big record label
should be doing?

166
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,822
You know, that's how all
big companies operate.

167
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,792
If it sells, anything goes.

168
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,692
Yasu!

169
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:58,852
And Gaia likely has something to do
with all this commotion as well.

170
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,292
I knew it.

171
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:05,052
This is no more than a speculation
by Mr. Kawano and Mr. Matsuo.

172
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:12,142
The TV station that airs
Morning Seven has two music shows,

173
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,372
and there are also other shows
that Gaia is tied up to.

174
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,182
So, you see, they have to get along
with each other

175
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,582
to maintain their present relationship.

176
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,652
For the network to introduce
our band like that,

177
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:30,592
they must've contacted Gaia
ahead of time.

178
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,432
Otherwise, they would never mention
the company name.

179
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:39,472
The show acted like a promotion
for us probably

180
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:43,062
because Gaia allowed the show
to air under such conditions.

181
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,442
Should the topic fail
and we end up getting crushed,

182
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,342
Gaia would lose nothing from it.

183
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,042
They're the worst.

184
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:55,442
Nana's sucking it in,
but she's gotta be really hurt by this.

185
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,912
I don't wanna debut through
an agency like that.

186
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:06,322
But no matter who you team up with,
there will always be a hidden side.

187
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:10,132
The good thing about Gaia is,
if they want to,

188
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,362
they have deep pockets to assist us with.

189
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,742
It's one thing to be all about music,

190
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:18,032
but unless people get to hear it,
what's the point?

191
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,042
If we're going pro,

192
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,742
then it's to our advantage to team up
with a place

193
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,682
that will dish out the most money
for production and advertising.

194
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:31,622
I'm sure there are a number of things
you're not satisfied about, but...

195
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:35,712
Lately, my life's been full of
things I'm not satisfied with.

196
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:39,492
Then you must've
figured it out by now.

197
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:44,902
Justice doesn't always
prevail in this world.

198
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:49,872
If you don't wanna lose,
you've gotta be tough.

199
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,772
You've gotta be more cunning.

200
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:06,172
If you can't do that, go back to
Terashima Inn.

201
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,092
When I turned on the TV,
the afternoon talk show was on.

202
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,792
Ren was surrounded by reporters.

203
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:25,442
Watching him in the lobby of
the international airport walking quickly

204
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:30,002
and without saying a word,
I feel a bit left behind again.

205
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:35,142
I have no idea where Ren was going.

206
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:38,852
I don't even know what
he is aiming for.

207
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:47,492
I remembered us talking about
living together in that warehouse again,

208
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:50,602
and began to think that it was
even less likely to come true

209
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:54,122
than my dream of making it
as a singer.

210
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,332
Hey, Jun-chan,
I wonder where Ren flew to.

211
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,672
Leaving Nana behind.

212
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:07,272
What I wanna know is how long
do you plan on staying here?

213
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:10,782
If Ren went overseas, does that mean
that Takumi went too?

214
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,092
Without me?

215
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:15,952
Kyosuke tells you to come here,
and then flees off to school.

216
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,962
Men can be so selfish.

217
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,392
When's he coming back?
We haven't made up yet after that fight.

218
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:21,022
What should I do?

219
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,762
Nana, you should go back
to your parents.

220
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,872
That would be the best for everyone.

221
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:31,042
No way! Not after Nana sent me
that beautiful message of encouragement!

222
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,002
Was that a message of encouragement?

223
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,272
HACHIKO

224
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,312
HACHIKO
Nana's hanging in there,

225
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,112
HACHIKO
no matter how tough things
are for her,

226
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,812
HACHIKO
so I've gotta gather myself
and do my best too.

227
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:39,052
HACHIKO

228
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:41,252
HACHIKO
No, in your case, the more you try

229
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,652
HACHIKO
the more you cause problems
to those around you.

230
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:42,882
HACHIKO

231
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,782
HACHIKO
You'd do better quietly starting
from square one.

232
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:45,052
HACHIKO

233
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:46,592
Can I reach him on his cell
while he's overseas?

234
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,192
Maybe I can still catch him.

235
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:50,522
She's not listening one bit.

236
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:54,222
I'm looking forward to London.
I wonder how Stella is doing.

237
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:57,092
Who's Stella?

238
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:58,692
Takumi's lover in London.

239
00:11:58,832 --> 00:11:59,872
- Lover in London?
- Lover in London?

240
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,842
Wow. He's even got one overseas.

241
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:01,942
I ENVY HIM
Wow. He's even got one overseas.

242
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:02,302
I ENVY HIM

243
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,172
I ENVY HIM
And she's blonde.

244
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,142
I ENVY HIM
- She's blonde?
- A blonde?

245
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:04,642
- She's blonde?
- A blonde?

246
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,242
He not only has one in England.

247
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,262
He also has...

248
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:09,882
Oh, Takumi!
Thank goodness I got through!

249
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:11,182
- The U.S., China...
- What? Really? Awesome!

250
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,872
- Oh, hello. Sorry we're late.
- What's the matter?

251
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:17,882
Um, I-I'm sorry. I said some
horrible things this morning.

252
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:19,712
This morning?

253
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,362
What do you mean troublesome?

254
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,722
Outsiders like you need to shut up!

255
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,192
Oh.

256
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:32,602
That's all.

257
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:34,402
Sorry.

258
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:36,892
I know an "outsider" like me shouldn't
be calling you at such a busy time.

259
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,872
SO SAD...

260
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:45,402
Hello?

261
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:51,312
Listen, I'm going to England tomorrow.

262
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,822
I'll email you the hotel's number,

263
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,452
so call me there if you need
to reach me.

264
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:59,252
They have Japanese speaking staff
at the front desk.

265
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,352
From tomorrow? For how long?

266
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,162
Hmm... Probably about half a month.

267
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:05,322
Half a month?!

268
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,302
It's only half a month.

269
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,142
Even if I was here,

270
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:14,162
I wouldn't be able to see you in
this commotion, so it's the same.

271
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:14,942
It's not the same!
It's totally different!

272
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,512
STUPID... STUPID
It's not the same!
It's totally different!

273
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:16,942
It's not the same!
It's totally different!

274
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,412
Really?

275
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,772
Anyway that's how it is.

276
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:25,022
I won't be able to go
see your parents for a while.

277
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,212
Please explain the situation to them
and apologize for me.

278
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:32,562
Then maybe I'll go back to my parents
while you're in England.

279
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,622
It would be lonely staying here.

280
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:35,432
Yeah, why don't you do that?

281
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,392
So, what have you decided to do?

282
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,102
Will you raise the child
at your parents' place?

283
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,332
No way! I want my own family.

284
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,012
I've decided that,
no matter what happens,

285
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:47,602
you and I and the baby
will live happily together.

286
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,902
Just the three of us? We can have more.

287
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:56,012
Come on. We don't need to have more
for no reason.

288
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,922
Just help me raise a good kid.

289
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:01,752
I got it.

290
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:07,222
I'll buy you a gift from England.
Is there anything you want?

291
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:08,492
A diamond ring!

292
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:13,532
Right. Come to think of it,
I didn't get you an engagement ring yet.

293
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:14,732
What size?

294
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:15,832
Seven.

295
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:17,072
Roger.

296
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,172
Jun-chan! He's getting me
an engagement ring as a present!

297
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,412
Congratulations.

298
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,942
Our dreams are finally coming true.

299
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:34,422
But the ideals we want and the reality
that presses against us

300
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:38,152
always stand staring at each other
and things don't quite work out.

301
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:43,962
Let's drink.

302
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:46,572
Nana...

303
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:50,162
You said something about Hachi on TV,
didn't you?

304
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:53,062
I just sent her a secret message.

305
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,582
I'm getting all kinds of email

306
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:56,912
from people wanting to know
what Hachiko is.

307
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,202
It's worse than the spam mail
I get from dating sites.

308
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,142
Oh, sorry.

309
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,282
It's okay.

310
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,452
To be safe, I told everyone that
it's your pet dog.

311
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,522
I really am sorry.
I keep causing you trouble.

312
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,832
If you had never gotten
involved with me,

313
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:17,192
you would likely have had
a more peaceful life.

314
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:21,532
It's okay.
I'm doing this because I want to.

315
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,342
I guess I'm living in a story

316
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,472
where I'm at the mercy of women
named "Nana."

317
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,212
What story is that?

318
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:30,772
The story of Nobuo!

319
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,112
Then the name of the next woman
appearing in that story will also be Nana.

320
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,612
Please spare me from that.

321
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:47,222
I'm sorry, but I can't erase Hachi
from my story.

322
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:53,792
She's not likely to disappear
from my story either.

323
00:15:56,002 --> 00:16:01,772
But I'm probably long gone
from Hachi's story.

324
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:08,412
Hey, Jun-chan, look.
Such a beautiful moon.

325
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,652
Putting that aside,
are you planning on staying here?

326
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:15,052
But it's not round.
I wonder when the next full moon is.

327
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,122
If you're planning on staying over,
I'll tell Kyosuke to stay at...

328
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:22,662
You know, Jun-chan,
that night of the full moon

329
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:25,602
was probably the happiest moment
of my life.

330
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,832
Which night?

331
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,172
I felt that I had everything I wanted.

332
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,872
My heart was filled with
hopes and dreams,

333
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,002
and my future appeared
to be shining brightly.

334
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:44,442
I don't think I'll ever be covered
in such pure happiness again.

335
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:51,682
I thought I could do anything for Hachi.

336
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,132
But in the end, when I was challenged,

337
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:58,122
I couldn't do anything. I am pathetic.

338
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:04,972
She is really the worst kind of woman,
so why can't I give her up?

339
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,912
There's no need to give her up.
There's still hope.

340
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:13,482
Where?!

341
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:16,882
You just need to go along with my plan.

342
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:18,752
What plan is that?

343
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,882
The plan to get Hachiko back.

344
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:24,692
Once she's back in our yard,
you can copulate with her again.

345
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,692
You're still talking about her
as if she's a dog.

346
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:30,222
Stop grumbling! If you're a man, fight!

347
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:32,002
I don't need you telling me.
Sure I'll fight!

348
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:42,342
My plan is simple.
Keep showing Hachi sweet dreams.

349
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:47,082
We, BLAST, just have to keep appearing
in Hachi's story

350
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,142
as the really cool band.

351
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:50,282
NANA OSAKI

352
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,692
NANA OSAKI
Then, eventually, she will return for sure.

353
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,122
NANA OSAKI

354
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:59,732
NANA OSAKI
That cold-hearted man who's always
shoving the cruel reality onto her

355
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:02,762
NANA OSAKI
cannot bring happiness to a woman
like Hachi who loves to be spoiled.

356
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,922
NANA OSAKI

357
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:06,502
CONTRACT

358
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,902
CONTRACT
We plan to use all
our company resources to promote you.

359
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:10,072
CONTRACT

360
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:11,642
CONTRACT
We have high hopes for you.

361
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:12,412
CONTRACT

362
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:13,912
CONTRACT
Let's do our best together.

363
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:20,372
Nana!

364
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,922
We plan to hit number one with
our first release.

365
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,392
We look forward to working with you.

366
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:38,952
Ren!

367
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,502
Have a look.

368
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:55,142
- Big boobs!
- No, not the big boobs.

369
00:18:58,482 --> 00:18:59,852
Beautiful woman?

370
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:05,022
The title has no class
but the content is just as bad.

371
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:08,052
They probably instigated the party.

372
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:11,222
They must really like your woman.

373
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:13,862
Well, even I fell for her.

374
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:22,972
And Gaia eagerly supports this.
I have a bad feeling.

375
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:25,272
What?

376
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:28,742
Are you returning this?

377
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:31,752
Nana?

378
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,852
Long time no see Mr. Nakamura.

379
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:35,762
You weren't here when I came to rent it,

380
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,782
so I thought you had quit.

381
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,662
I'm glad to see you looking well.

382
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:41,632
Did you come back
because you missed me?

383
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:42,202
NANA REALLY HAS
A THING FOR ME
Did you come back
because you missed me?

384
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:42,702
NANA REALLY HAS
A THING FOR ME

385
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,162
NANA REALLY HAS
A THING FOR ME
Can you overlook my late fee?

386
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:45,092
Sure.

387
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,202
Lucky me!

388
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,562
I'm feeling great today.

389
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,532
Maybe I'll drop by the beauty salon
near the station.

390
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:51,972
I wonder if it's still there.

391
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:57,442
Hello, Miss Hachiko? BLAST's
debut date has been decided!

392
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,272
Really?! When?!

393
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:03,442
Say, Mari.

394
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:07,212
When's the release date
for our next single?

395
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,292
October 31st.

396
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:14,252
BLACK STONES
DEBUT SINGLE
OCTOBER 31 (WEDNESDAY)
FIRST PRESS EDITION INCLUDES
POSTER AND STICKER

397
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:19,792
Yes, yes.

398
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:35,012
DIE NANA

399
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,422
You know Hachi.

400
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:44,362
I can no longer be the hero
in your story,

401
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:49,062
but the name of the heroine
in my story is still Nana.

402
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:54,032
The super cute Nana. You.

403
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:05,912
I can't count
how many nights

404
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:10,682
I wished tomorrow
would never come

405
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:17,452
To live as I am
without being fake

406
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:21,052
What do I need

407
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:29,202
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

408
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:34,372
The answer is
too close to see

409
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:40,612
Black tears are
falling down

410
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:47,552
I have nothing,
only sadness

411
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:52,652
I can't put it
into words

412
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:58,722
My whole body
starts to ache

413
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:04,132
I can't stand it anymore
on my own

414
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:16,642
NANA LOVE
