Oh, you are a prince from the neighboring country.

Our princess suddenly passed away today, being cast a spell by a witch.

Oh. How pitiful.

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,700
return me to the original size?

41
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,920
How in the world is it possible?

42
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,190
Yeah, right.

43
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,940
First of all, do you have the qualities to be called a princess?

44
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,250
So, who is the prince?

45
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,840
Well, I don't have any particular person in mind...

46
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,850
Is it Takagi? Takagi Riku?

47
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,250
- He confessed to you, didn't he?<br>- Eh?

48
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,070
Well, I understand how you got carried away being confessed to.

49
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,170
But, don't you have to think of a more realistic way of returning to the original size?

50
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,940
I am not getting carried away. I'm seriously thinking...

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,730
said to be the two great female writers in the Heian period (794 to 1185).

<i>And they had written very famous books.</i>

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,510
So, what was it? On a night of a full moon,

180
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,840
you are supposed to shake the mallet while you make a wish. Was it?

181
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,300
Right.

182
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,000
From where can I go in?

183
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,360
<i>Minami-kun.</i>

184
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,160
I can go in from there, right?

185
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,600
Here we go!

186
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,460
Be careful.

187
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,090
Oh.

188
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,880
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

189
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,190
Minami-kun. Over here!

190
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,990
<i>Over here!</i>

191
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,080
It is convenient to be small in this kind of situation.

192
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,550
Ahem.

193
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,930
This is the real lucky mallet.

194
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,460
Seriously?

195
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,540
Please, please get me back

196
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,460
to my normal size.

197
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,150
Please!

198
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,750
<i>Amazing. Really amazing.</i>

199
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,120
<i>I can now go back</i>

200
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,210
<i>to the world I lived and the life I used to have.</i>

201
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,670
<i>I don't like you anymore.</i>

202
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,110
Hmm?

203
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,960
Eh?

204
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,630
What?

205
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,600
Didn't work.

206
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,500
No way. It was shining.

207
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,510
It really looked like it was gonna work.

208
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,090
<i>This way.</i>

209
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,000
Shoot!

210
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,300
- Hurry.<br><i>- Who is there? A thief?</i>

211
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,590
Oh? Shunichi-kun?

212
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,250
So, you have been worried that much.

213
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,880
Not worried.

214
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,170
Right.

215
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,240
Why don't you take it easy?

216
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,540
Ohno sensei said that you would be able to pass med school with no problem.

217
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,750
Sorry for doing a weird thing.

218
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,790
But, I am somewhat relieved.

219
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:35,420
I have thought that you would pretend to be strong, sayting you wouldn't believe in God.

220
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,670
You still have a cute side.

221
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,920
It's okay to whine sometimes.

222
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,470
And, you don't have to force yourself to limit the colleges of your choice.

223
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,550
Eh?

224
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,080
You were going to choose only those with tuition waver programs, right?

225
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,490
<i>Why?</i>

226
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,960
<i>The hospital director told me that his daughter is concerned (about you).</i>

227
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,370
Right.

228
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,800
It is true that it's hard to make ends meet for us.

229
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,620
I know how hard you have been working.

230
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:29,800
You have been working harder than anyone else in order to protect me and your grandma.

231
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,450
I don't want you to overstrain yourself anymore.

232
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,870
Minami-kun.

233
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,460
Shunichi.

234
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,920
You can aim for a med school you really want to go.

235
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't underestimate me.

236
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,900
It is super easy for me to let you go to a college you like.

237
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,430
Okay?

238
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,170
Super easy...

239
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,810
A storm is coming, it seems.

240
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,960
Your grandma is not home, she's traveling. Shall we order pizza?

241
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,980
Yup.

242
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,870
Let's hurry.

243
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,540
I'm sorry, Minami-kun.

244
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,370
It's my fault.

245
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,820
It doesn't matter, it can't be helped.

246
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,360
Yah!

247
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,150
Minami-Kun?

248
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,260
The day when you became small

249
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,560
was like this, right?

250
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,340
Right.

251
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,810
Okay.

252
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,440
Shall we make another foolish attempt?

253
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,680
What?

This is where you became small.

257
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,440
That day, you fainted at the sound of thunder. Then you woke up finding yourself small. Correct?

258
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,770
I see!

259
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,680
If I do the same thing here again...

260
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,220
That could be possible.

261
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,810
These are your clothes.

262
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,410
You washed them.

263
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,340
I couldn't have left them as they were.

264
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,390
Thank you.

265
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,100
So, I will come pick you up in the morning.

266
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,320
Eh? Wait!

267
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,950
<i>You are going?</i>

268
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,380

But...

270
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,680
It's too much to be by myself in this storm.

271
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,790
I am small, so I might die before becoming big.

<i>a beginning of love already.</i>

292
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,280
It hasn't been updated.

293
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,070

301
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,330
Minami-kun. I am big again, back to myself again.

303
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,360
It's all thanks to Minami-kun.

00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,440
Hey, no...

306
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,660
Stop it.

307
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,720
How awful.

308
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,750
Huh?

309
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,070
Was it a dream?

310
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,360
It's impossible after all.

311
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,420
Huh?

312
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,780

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,600
I see.

315
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,930
You couldn't return to original size.

316
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,020
Are you alright?

317
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,920
I am a fool after all.

318
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,740

<i>Oh!</i>

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,590
You have a high fever.

321
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,770
Nobody's home. What should I do?

322
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,570
Oh, right. I have to bring down the fever.

323
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm finally here.

324
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,590
Chiyomi.

325
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,640
I couldn't bring anything.

326
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,310
Water, ice cubes or anything at all.

327
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,470
All I could do was just come back here.

328
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,020
I'm sorry.

329
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,740
Don't worry and stay here.

330
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,850
Once upon a time, there lived an old man called 'Old Bamboo-Cutter.'

331
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,360
He cut bamboos in mountains and fields and used them for a variety of things.

332
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,140
His name was Sanuki no Miyatsuko.

333
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,690
He thought it was strange and approached it. Then the bamboo shined inside.

334
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,750
<i>Minami Kun No Koibito <br> My Little Lover</i>

335
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,330
His fever is going up.

336
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,550
I wish I could cool him down.

337
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,690
I'm sorry, did I wake you up?

338
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,070
No.

339
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,450
You are feeling sick?

340
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,210
I feel foggy.

341
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,290
Who can it be?

342
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,710
Are you okay? Can you walk?

343
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,080
I'm okay.

344
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,040
Are you hungry?

345
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,540
A little.

346
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,200
I'll bring you something, too.

Yes.

356
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,220
It was good timing then. Here.

357
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,020
You have a fever, right? We brought you food.

358
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,600
Since you have a fever, you'll get <i>udon</i> noodles. Yabuki and I will -

359
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,470
I'm fine.

360
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,220
You don't want it? It's not good for you if you don't eat anything.

361
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,420
I'm not hungry.

362
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,690
Actually, we came here because you are sick, but I have someting else to --

363
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,350
- I'm not going back to the kendo club.<br>- Don't make such a hasty decision.

364
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,950
I have already decided.

365
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,840
Ah... That might be the case, but

366
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,040
let's talk about your talent in kendo that you are not even aware of --

367
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,380
No, thank you.

368
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,750
He is so unapproachable.

369
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,050
Come on, Minami. Why don't you just listen to him?

370
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,000
Give me a break!

371
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,220
Would you please leave?

372
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,870
Let's talk about kendo some other time --

373
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,600
I won't.

374
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,960
Then, let's go, Yabuki.

375
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,250
If you are worried about something, tell me any time.

376
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,830
I will do my best to consult you.

377
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,440
Okay.

378
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,960
You should also be interested in real women.

379
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,290
<i>- Thank you for having us.<br>- So long.</i>

380
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,110
<i>(An obscene magazine)</i>

381
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,480
Oh.

382
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,080
Sorry for doing this without asking you.

383
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,800
I was looking for information on how to bring down fever.

384
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,350
I learned that it is good to cool the carotid artery and the armpits.

385
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,420
I know.

386
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,580
Oh, you knew.

387
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,300
My mom is a nurse.

388
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,550
I see.

389
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,630
That makes sense.

390
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,880
Thank you.

391
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,180
Sorry.

392
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,300
Umm... I am really sorry.

393
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,420
I caused you even to have fever.

394
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,640
Don't worry. I did it myself.

395
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,330
They came again?

396
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,080
What's with them?

397
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,640
Don't you have to answer the door?

398
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,340
No.

399
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,620
I forgot to lock it.

400
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,170
<i>Hello. Minami-kun.</i>

401
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,990
Nomura?

402
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,300
Go hide yourself.

403
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,830
<i>Minami-kun. Are you there?</i>

404
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,850
Yes.

405
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,500
Ah.

406
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,460
Nomura-san.

407
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,700
Nomura.

408
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,340
Sorry for coming in without asking.

409
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,960
It's okay.

410
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,750
Why?

411
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:34,550
Well, I heard you were staying home sick, and I got worried.

412
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,430
I see. Thanks.

413
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,630
Are you okay?

414
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,370
Yeah.

415
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,300
I feel a little foggy.

416
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,930
This...

417
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,470
I am not hungry, so...

418
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,330
How is it?

419
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,410
Good.

420
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,550
Really? I'm glad.

421
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,590
It was delicious. Thank you.

422
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,920
I will make it any time if you like it.

423
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,580
Minami-kun?

424
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,820
You have a high fever. Sorry I didn't notice.

425
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,050
Lie down and rest.

426
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,250
Thank you.

427
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,010
Wait a minute.

428
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,660
Minami-kun.

429
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,300
Thank you.

430
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,880
Don't worry and rest.

431
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,500
<i>I'm sorry, Minami-kun.</i>

432
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,860
