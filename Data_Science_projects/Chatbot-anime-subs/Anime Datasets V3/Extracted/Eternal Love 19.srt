<i>[Episode 19]</i>

3
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,843
Ye Hua!

4
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:50,604
You plotted to kill my son.

5
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,764
Today, I will have you
die by my Soul Slayer!

6
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,883
Attack!

7
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:10,204
Attack!

8
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,364
Attack!

9
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,644
<i>Why do I feel so flustered tonight?</i>

10
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,403
Ye Hua?

11
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,084
Ye Hua?

12
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,003
Is he asleep?

13
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,324
Ye Hua!

14
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:14,723
Your Highness!

15
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,603
Your Highness!

16
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:29,444
<i>Ye Hua? Ye Hua, wake up! Ye Hua!</i>

17
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,483
<i>- Ye Hua, hold on! Hold on!</i>
- Ye Hua?

18
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:36,163
<i>- Ye Hua, wake up! Wake up!</i>
- Ye Hua?

19
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,923
What's wrong, Ye Hua?

20
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,764
Ye Hua!

21
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,684
Ye Hua, wait for me!

22
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,644
Ye Hua!

23
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:58,283
Ye Hua!

24
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:00,603
Ye Hua!

25
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,963
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

26
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,603
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

27
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,524
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

28
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,524
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

29
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,723
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

30
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,603
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

31
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,324
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

32
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:32,963
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

33
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,564
Ye Hua!

34
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,324
Ye Hua!

35
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,603
Ye Hua!

36
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,524
Ye Hua!

37
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,923
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

38
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,124
Who are you?

39
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,963
Where is Ye Hua?

40
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,963
Where is Ye Hua?

41
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,603
Why would you know the crown prince?

42
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,803
Speak!

43
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,603
I don't know any crown prince.

44
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,923
I just want to find Ye Hua.

45
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,043
Where is Ye Hua?

46
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,324
Impudence.

47
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:46,803
Who are you to speak
the crown prince's given name?

48
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:49,884
Please calm your anger, Father.

49
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,204
Please calm down, Heavenly Lord.

50
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,524
Stop right there.

51
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:05,644
I did not tell you to rise.
You dare to rise?

52
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,363
Do you know what this place is?

53
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:15,043
This is the Celestial Palace.

54
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,163
Celestial Palace?

55
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,764
Who are you?

56
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,884
How dare you act atrociously
in the Celestial Palace?

57
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,604
Nobody can save you.

58
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:38,844
Even if it is Ye Hua, he wouldn't
have the courage to save you.

59
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:40,884
- Guards.
- Present.

60
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,323
Throw this mortal into
the Evil Sealing Pagoda.

61
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:47,323
- Yes.
- Yes.

62
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,323
- No, no!
- Go.

63
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,283
Please save me. Please save me!

64
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,764
You... You are Ye Hua's woman?

65
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:03,203
Ye Hua and I bowed to heaven and earth.

66
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:06,844
I am carrying his child in my womb.

67
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:11,203
Can you bring me to see him?

68
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:13,443
Bring me to him, please?

69
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:15,004
What did you say?

70
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,323
Stand up.

71
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,604
Come with me.

72
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:30,724
Kneel.

73
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:38,163
Your Highness.

74
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,043
She really is carrying
Ye Hua's child in her womb.

75
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:44,043
Are you certain?
Could there be a mistake?

76
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,524
Your Highness, you know very well

77
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:49,124
in the Celestial Palace,
aside from Medicine King

78
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,884
I am the only one who can
read a pulse most accurately.

79
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,004
Father.

80
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,244
She really is carrying Ye Hua's child.

81
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:07,043
It is still not known whether
Ye Hua is dead or alive.

82
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:11,364
Please save his only child.

83
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:14,083
Le Xu.

84
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:18,923
She and Ye Hua
have violated heaven's law.

85
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:20,764
You want me to spare her.

86
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:24,124
Wouldn't that be telling me
to bend the law?

87
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,803
She truly is carrying Ye Hua's child.

88
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:33,443
Or, why don't you punish her
after she gives birth to the child?

89
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:37,884
Or, I am willing to carry
the punishment in her place.

90
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:41,683
Father.

91
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,604
I did not teach my son well.

92
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:46,124
I am willing to suffer
the punishment for this mortal.

93
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:49,563
Please save Ye Hua's child.

94
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:06,803
Take this mortal to
the unoccupied Zhaohua Palace

95
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,443
and place a strict watch on her.

96
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,163
Thank you, Father.

97
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,884
Thank you, Father.

98
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,884
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

99
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,964
Ye Hua!

100
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,604
Ye Hua!

101
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:39,683
Let me out!

102
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,364
Let me out!

103
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,764
I want to be with Ye Hua!

104
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,884
I want to be with him!

105
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:47,844
Let me out!

106
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:52,403
Ye Hua! Don't die!

107
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,043
Ye Hua.

108
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:08,563
Ye Hua.

109
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:17,244
<i>Ye Hua.</i>

110
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,923
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

111
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:39,923
Medicine King, come quick.
Crown Prince is waking.

112
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:50,004
His Highness has survived this trial.

113
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:55,244
Medicine King, step out first.

114
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:56,844
I have to speak with Crown Prince.

115
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,364
- This...
- Go out.

116
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:00,067
Yes.

117
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,844
Third Uncle.

118
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,884
What went wrong?

119
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:09,163
What about Su Su?

120
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,124
Ye Hua, listen to me.

121
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,724
Three days ago, after you were
slashed by the Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer

122
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:18,604
your wife in the mortal realm
dashed through your barrier.

123
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,163
What did you say?

124
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,244
Why?

125
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:29,043
She rushed through your barrier
and was found by Father.

126
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:31,443
Heavenly Lord... Heavenly Lord.

127
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,443
Ye Hua!

128
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:37,083
- Let go of me!
- Ye Hua!

129
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,163
- Let go.
- Listen to me!

130
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:45,043
If you want to save her,
then you better stay alive.

131
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:48,283
If you lose your life,
death will come to her shortly after!

132
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,524
She is still alive?

133
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,403
She is alive, she is still alive.

134
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,683
She is carrying your child.

135
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,163
You don't have to worry about her safety.

136
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,403
The Mermaid Clan has been
entirely annihilated.

137
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:27,004
Stay here a few days to recuperate

138
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:29,644
and then we'll return to
the Celestial Palace.

139
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:30,923
No.

140
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,524
We must not hurry back.

141
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:36,283
Don't you want to see her sooner?

142
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,283
From the moment
Heavenly Lord found out...

143
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,923
it was no longer possible to be with her.

144
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,604
Now the only way to save her life

145
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:56,403
is to make Heavenly Lord think

146
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:59,524
that she holds no importance to me.

147
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,683
What did you say?

148
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:22,443
On the first day of the war, he was
slashed by Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer

149
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,203
and was nearly killed.

150
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,964
Third Prince was afraid news of this
would affect the war

151
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,644
so he had the news suppressed.

152
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,604
How is Crown Prince now?

153
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:36,124
According to Medicine King's diagnosis,
Crown Prince has barely saved his spirit.

154
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:41,644
Good.

155
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,683
You have been following by
Crown Prince's side.

156
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:50,524
How could you let him take such a risk
and nearly lose his life?

157
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,443
When the army returns

158
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:59,163
you will go to Lord Pu Hua
for punishment.

159
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:00,484
Yes.

160
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,803
Wait.

161
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:05,283
Your Majesty.

162
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,163
Lord of Numinous Treasure'
assembly invitations have been sent out.

163
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:14,403
Everyone will be coming to
the Celestial Palace.

164
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,724
I can only go to Chang Sea
a few days later.

165
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:21,163
Have Third Prince take good care of him.

166
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:23,403
Yes.

167
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,683
Your Highness.

168
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:38,283
I must see His Majesty.

169
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,761
I'm afraid even if the sky falls down,
His Majesty won't be coming here.

170
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,816
Your Highness,
Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince

171
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,043
nearly lost his life to
the Mermaid Clan at Chang Sea.

172
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:48,244
Regardless, Mermaid Clan is
a part of the Ghost Tribe.

173
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,724
If Celestial Tribe seeks blame

174
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:52,067
Ghost Tribe will be
in deadly danger again.

175
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:57,364
Back when Qing Cang was sealed away,
Ghost Tribe was not in deadly danger.

176
00:16:58,364 --> 00:16:59,764
We won't be now either.

177
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:03,364
Impudence! How dare you speak
Ghost Lord's given name directly?

178
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,324
You are the impudent one.

179
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,443
Could it be that even after
70,000 years has passed

180
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:12,403
you still only have regard
for Qing Cang and not His Majesty?

181
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:13,963
Ghost Lord?

182
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:17,044
Who is the true master
of Grand Ziming Palace?

183
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,243
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

184
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,564
I can't be bothered with you.

185
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,203
Your Highness, this is an invitation
sent from the Celestial Palace.

186
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:37,517
Invitation?

187
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:39,963
Lord of Numinous Treasures of
the Realm of Supreme Purity

188
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,003
is holding an assembly.

189
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:43,284
This is the invitation for His Majesty.

190
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:01,124
You could have just sent someone.

191
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,324
You didn't have to come to
the mortal realm yourself.

192
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,203
Ever since the Mermaid Clan
was annihilated

193
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,243
the palace has been in turmoil.

194
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,644
The old subjects are afraid
the Celestial Tribe will think

195
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,923
the Mermaid Clan is
a part of the Ghost Tribe

196
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,003
and direct their anger at us.

197
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:22,963
They can't find you,
so they pester me all day long.

198
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:24,844
I had no choice

199
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:27,644
but to use the invitation to come ask you

200
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:30,124
when you will be returning
to the Ghost Realm.

201
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,284
I will go directly to
the Celestial Palace.

202
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:41,604
You are going to the assembly?

203
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,443
To discuss scriptures and Daoism?

204
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:48,644
When have I ever known
how to speak about scriptures?

205
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,683
And how would I know
how to discuss Daoism?

206
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:58,443
I am only going to offer a humble apology
and make amends to the Celestial Tribe.

207
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,443
No matter what reason you had

208
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,564
taking my military seal
was a huge offense.

209
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,284
Seeing as you and I are husband and wife

210
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:17,683
I will not punish you.

211
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,884
Return to the palace
to reflect on the past.

212
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,844
Your Majesty!

213
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,203
You cannot treat me in this way.

214
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:33,324
I am... carrying your child in my womb.

215
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,284
What did you say?

216
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:43,884
That night... I conceived your child.

217
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,364
How is that possible?

218
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:52,324
Why not?

219
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,884
Don't you want a child?

220
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,963
Your Majesty will be a father.

221
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:07,324
Aren't you happy?

222
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:12,243
I have been hoping for this day
for 70,000 years.

223
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,124
Never mind.

224
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:33,003
I'll return to the palace with you.

225
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,884
Medicine King, quick!

226
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:04,523
This...

227
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:06,804
- What happened?
- Quick, save him.

228
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,604
Your Highness.

229
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:11,084
Your Highness.

230
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,403
Get out!

231
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,443
You are but my father's consort.

232
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,124
How dare you trespass into
the heir apparent's chambers?

233
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,923
Get out right now!

234
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:02,443
Please let me out. I want to see Ye Hua.

235
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,483
Tell me. Is Ye Hua still alive?

236
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,044
Is he still--

237
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:22,963
Ye Hua.

238
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,644
Don't die.

239
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,604
<i>Ye Hua.</i>

240
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:54,804
<i>Ye Hua. I'm begging you, Ye Hua.
Say something, please.</i>

241
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,044
<i>Ye Hua?</i>

242
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,443
<i>Ye Hua, say something.</i>

243
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,683
<i>Ye Hua, say something.</i>

244
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:05,884
<i>Ye Hua! Ye Hua!</i>

245
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,003
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

246
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:15,963
What? Crown Prince kept
a woman in the mortal realm?

247
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,084
This matter must not be made known.

248
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:20,243
But he already has
an engagement with my aunt.

249
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,483
Why did he have to seek other women?

250
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:26,163
Your Highness, even
the mortal realm's emperor

251
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,284
has a harem of countless women

252
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,723
let alone the next Heavenly Lord.

253
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,604
Even if Crown Prince
doesn't seek them himself

254
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:35,003
he will still have many consorts later

255
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:38,003
to continue bearing a line of heirs
for the Celestial Tribe.

256
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:41,284
Nonsense. A line of heirs?

257
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,723
Qing Qiu has always been
one man and one wife.

258
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,804
Our line hasn't ended.

259
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:49,403
No, I have to find out.

260
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,163
It's locked?

261
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,884
<i>Are you still alive?</i>

262
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:11,564
I am Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.

263
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:14,804
Are you the woman that
Ye Hua had in the mortal realm?

264
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,443
You said Ye Hua?

265
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,003
Of course.

266
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:28,644
He is the Crown Prince.

267
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:31,324
<i>Who doesn't know of him
in the Nine Heavens?</i>

268
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,804
Is he still alive?

269
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:38,443
I don't know.
Did something happen to him?

270
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:44,304
Not even you know?

271
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,124
Ye Hua.

272
00:24:53,963 --> 00:24:55,884
Wait, wait.

273
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:57,963
I still have things to ask you.

274
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,203
Don't cry yet.

275
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:03,763
Wait, wait!

276
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:14,243
Heavenly Lord won't allow us
to speak to the mortal

277
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:16,203
and won't allow us
to speak of this matter.

278
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:20,443
While Crown Prince is not around,
could he be thinking of--

279
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:21,804
You can't speak of it.

280
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:24,340
Have you forgotten the incident of
the Water King of North Sea?

281
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:38,364
Clearly, I should be feeling furious
on Aunt's behalf.

282
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:40,963
Why do I still feel a little sad?

283
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:47,403
This mortal is actually quite pitiful.

284
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:51,044
<i>I'm not eating. I'm not eating!</i>

285
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:52,564
<i>I want to see Ye Hua.</i>

286
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:08,804
Your Majesty, are you really
going to the Celestial Palace?

287
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:13,403
The Mermaid Clan was
a part of the Ghost Tribe.

288
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,923
Although they separated
from us for 70,000 years

289
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:18,284
they had severely injured
the Crown Prince this time.

290
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,564
It is difficult for me to escape blame.

291
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:26,644
I can make use of
Lord of Numinous Treasure's assembly

292
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:28,644
to go to the Celestial Palace
to apologize

293
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,723
to prevent the Ghost Tribe
from being further implicated.

294
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,243
I understand.

295
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,564
Your Majesty is doing so
for the sake of the Ghost Tribe.

296
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:42,044
But, these three days were the happiest
I've been in these 70,000 years.

297
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,044
I can't bear for you to leave.

298
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,483
Take good care of your health.

299
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:54,844
Shaman, how come she is feeling so unwell
so early in the pregnancy?

300
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,564
Ghost Queen is an immortal.

301
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,723
The child in her womb is of Ghost Tribe.

302
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:10,163
There will be times when
their essences conflict.

303
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:12,804
I think with more bed rest

304
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:16,243
she will naturally feel better
as the months go by.

305
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:18,044
That's good.

306
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:21,284
I'll have the Shaman stay
to keep you company.

307
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,403
No.

308
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:29,443
You haven't been to the Celestial Palace
ever since you took the throne.

309
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:31,604
Since you are going to an assembly

310
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:35,084
then as Ghost Queen,
I must stay by your side.

311
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,923
You are carrying
a child of the Ghost Tribe.

312
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,044
It already disagrees with
your immortal essence.

313
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:42,604
If you go to the Celestial Palace,
won't you feel even more unwell?

314
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,203
It does not bother me.

315
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:46,963
When women in the mortal realm
are pregnant

316
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:49,443
there will be times when
they feel unwell.

317
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:52,923
I am the Ghost Queen.
How would I be so delicate?

318
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:58,403
All right.

319
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:24,884
In the 49 days of the assembly,
Ghost Lord shall stay here.

320
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:27,564
If you have any requests,
please let me know.

321
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:28,963
Thank you.

322
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:38,923
I shall take my leave.

323
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:41,044
May I ask.

324
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:42,324
Do you know

325
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,003
where the winter lotus sent from
the Ghost Realm 70,000 years ago

326
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:46,483
is being kept now?

327
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:50,804
Winter lotus? It is in the lotus pond
next to the Zhaohua Palace.

328
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:55,003
- Can you take me there?
- Yes.

329
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,804
I'll be back soon.

330
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:02,044
I just feel a bit...

331
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:06,884
a bit unwell,
so I won't be going with you.

332
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,723
Stay here with her.

333
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:45,003
Didn't you say you would
surely save this child for me?

334
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:47,364
Why does my stomach constantly hurt?

335
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,084
Perhaps it is because

336
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:53,443
you have been living in the Ghost Realm
for too long as an immortal

337
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:56,963
and your body has many injuries,
so it isn't fit...

338
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,443
to conceive a child.

339
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,443
Not fit?

340
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:03,044
Then what am I carrying now?

341
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,124
Your Highness, I...

342
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:11,044
I... I can no longer feel
the young prince's heartbeat.

343
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,604
What did you say?

344
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:18,284
Your Highness, please calm down.

345
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:20,564
I am speaking the truth.

346
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:23,804
The young prince no longer
has any signs of being alive.

347
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:26,483
I think Your Highness should
return to the Ghost Realm.

348
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:30,523
I will give you a medicine,
and have the young prince...

349
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:33,203
Your Highness,
now that it has come to this

350
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:36,683
your own health is more important.

351
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:38,284
No.

352
00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:41,084
I must save this child!

353
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:43,124
Didn't you see?

354
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:46,844
In these 70,000 years, His Majesty has
never treated me with such patience.

355
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,364
I must keep this child.

356
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:53,003
I must!

357
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:00,443
You are not allowed to tell anybody.
Do you hear me?

358
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:05,324
Otherwise, I will take your life.
Your entire clan's life!

359
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,923
I will definitely keep my mouth shut.

360
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:20,644
<i>Where is that peach blossom fragrance
coming from? It is so familiar.</i>

361
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:58,763
Ghost Lord?

362
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,084
Lord of Numinous Treasures.

363
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:13,403
It has been many millennia
since I last saw you.

364
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:16,844
Seeing your back just now,
I wasn't certain it was you.

365
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:21,804
Yes, it's been 70,000 years.

366
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:27,923
I remember the first time I met you
was at Kunlun Mountain.

367
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,884
Just now, I heard the palace maids say

368
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,124
you had just arrived.

369
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:38,723
How come you would be in the mood
to admire this lotus?

370
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:41,203
I came to see the winter lotus.

371
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,523
I'm afraid it had been in
the Ghost Realm for too long

372
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,923
and is not used to
the Celestial Realm's lotus pond.

373
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:53,403
I did not expect you to be
such an attentive person.

374
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:56,723
You would be so concerned about a lotus.

375
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:03,324
<i>- Fire! Help put out the fire!
- Help! Fire!</i>

376
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:05,604
<i>- Someone! Help!</i>
- Zhaohua Palace!

377
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:10,844
Quickly find someone to put out the fire.
There's still someone inside.

378
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,523
How come there is a fire?

379
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:25,204
It is my mount
who has caused this trouble.

380
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:27,003
Please forgive me, Lord.

381
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:29,804
You need not blame yourself too much.

382
00:35:06,244 --> 00:35:09,083
- Is this lady hurt?
- I am not certain.

383
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,963
I'm taking her back to
Realm of Supreme Purity

384
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,507
and have my shaman take a look.

385
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:29,443
A-Yin.

386
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,844
A-Yin.

387
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:42,204
<i>Her? How come she is here?</i>

388
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,684
<i>No, it's impossible.</i>

389
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:51,043
Your Majesty, it must be
a Celestial transformed. It must be.

390
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:53,684
They know Your Majesty
had a relationship to Si Yin

391
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,563
and must have transformed someone
into Si Yin's image to deceive you.

392
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:58,403
Shaman!

393
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,804
- Your Majesty.
- Quick, treat her injuries.

394
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:05,364
She was hurt by crimson hellfire. Quick!

395
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,443
Yes.

396
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:18,324
How is she?

397
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:20,963
She may be an immortal

398
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:23,443
but being injured by crimson hellfire
can be very troublesome.

399
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:24,724
Do you think she needs...

400
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,403
Your Majesty.

401
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:29,123
This is just a mortal.

402
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:31,764
What? Mortal?

403
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,483
Mortal?

404
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:37,963
Yes, Your Majesty.
She is not an immortal.

405
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,804
She is just a mortal woman.

406
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:41,603
Are you certain?

407
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:54,724
There is no sign of immortal essence.

408
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:56,724
She is indeed a mortal.

409
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:01,244
I was confused.

410
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:04,025
I actually failed to tell the difference
between immortal and mortal.

411
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:09,003
- Treat her injuries.
- Yes.

412
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:20,043
<i>Rather than say her face
looks like Si Yin</i>

413
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:22,764
<i>I'd say she looks more like Bai Qian.</i>

414
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,963
<i>Fortunately, she is neither.</i>

415
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:39,844
Come in.

416
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:46,443
Your Majesty, I have done wrong.

417
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:49,083
Do you know this is not
Ghost Realm's Grand Ziming Palace?

418
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,083
This is the Nine Heavens.

419
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,844
Why did you use crimson hellfire
in the Celestial Palace?

420
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:56,603
I passed by that abandoned palace

421
00:37:56,603 --> 00:38:00,523
and felt that fragrance was so familiar,
so I followed the scent

422
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:05,684
and saw this woman locked in the chambers
and she was crying.

423
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,643
So...

424
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:09,963
So I wanted to help her out.

425
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:13,083
But the lock on the door
was millennium cold iron

426
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,364
and my powers could not break it.

427
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:18,003
So you used fire to burn it off?

428
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:22,804
Didn't Your Majesty say crimson hellfire
can exterminate all living things?

429
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,284
That is correct.

430
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,284
It can exterminate all living things.

431
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,443
That is why you are unable to
control the intensity of the fire.

432
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,284
You wanted to burn the lock

433
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:35,324
so naturally, the chamber
would burn as well.

434
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:36,884
Forget it.

435
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:40,443
I just hope Heavenly Lord
will not pursue this incident.

436
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:52,403
Where is Ye Hua?

437
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:54,923
What is this place?

438
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,643
Do you feel better?

439
00:38:58,443 --> 00:38:59,923
Who are you?

440
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,884
I am Ghost Lord Li Jing.

441
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,043
Just now, it was my mount
who accidentally set the fire.

442
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,563
I am truly sorry.

443
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:09,083
So it was a fire set by you.

444
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:12,724
I thought they wanted to take my life.

445
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:13,963
They?

446
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,923
How old are you?

447
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:29,923
70,300 years old.

448
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,043
70,300 years old?

449
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:38,563
Sister, the peach blossom scent on you
smells so nice.

450
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:47,483
Why would a mortal be living in
the Celestial Palace?

451
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,603
I was seized by them.

452
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,764
Have you seen Ye Hua?

453
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,324
Where is he?

454
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:57,804
How is he?

455
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,443
Ye Hua?

456
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:01,244
Who are you to the Crown Prince?

457
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:18,204
I am Crown Prince Ye Hua's mother,
Consort Le Xu.

458
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:21,164
Greetings, Consort Le Xu.

459
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:24,443
No need to stand on ceremony, Ghost Lord.

460
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:27,844
I heard you saved someone of mine.

461
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,603
I came to express my thanks

462
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:33,204
and take my person back.

463
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,204
This lady belongs to your palace?

464
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:39,884
That is correct.

465
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:42,244
This lady violated some of heaven's law.

466
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:45,483
I had her locked in Zhaohua Palace
to reflect on her mistakes.

467
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:49,403
I did not expect a fire to break out
and for her to be saved by you.

468
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:53,164
Go and take her away.

469
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,523
Yes.

470
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:09,603
I take my leave now.

471
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,684
Farewell, Your Highness.

472
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:36,244
Your Majesty, that lady is with child.

473
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,884
- I'm afraid...
- With child?

474
00:41:38,884 --> 00:41:42,244
Your Majesty, the Celestial Tribe has
always taken their laws seriously.

475
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:46,844
For them to keep a mortal in custody,
and one that is pregnant

476
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:51,003
this matter must not be simple.

477
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:57,003
I came on this trip to
the Celestial Palace to apologize.

478
00:41:57,963 --> 00:42:02,563
As for other people,
there is nothing I can do.

479
