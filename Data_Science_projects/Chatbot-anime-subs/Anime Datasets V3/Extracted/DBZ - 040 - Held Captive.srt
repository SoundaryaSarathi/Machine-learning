00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,291
P- please listen to us!

2
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,955
We come from a planet called Earth,
and in no way do we mean you any-

3
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,310
I don't want to hear anything
you invaders have to say to us!

4
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,980
Invaders? W- w- wait
just a minute, would you?

5
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,984
There's nothing sinister about us,
I tell you! We're not invaders!

6
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:34,315
Shut up!

7
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:38,990
Hold on a minute!
Those boys are right!

8
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,664
You talk too much for men!
You're not popular with the girls, so-

9
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,827
Stop standing around and do something!

10
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,339
Gohan, we're fighting.

11
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,829
Right.

12
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:25,637
Yee-ow-ow-ow!

13
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,472
Hey! What did you do that for!?

14
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:28,803
Don't move!

15
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,967
I- I really will kill you.

16
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:41,986
Zeshin, let's hurry and kill them.
These guys have to be Freeza's men.

17
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,647
Y- yeah...

18
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:53,327
W- we have to kill them, huh?

19
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,944
W- what's happening!?

20
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:09,280
Zeshin! Bad news!
We've gone into a meteor swarm!

21
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,441
What!? Damn...

22
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:17,786
Hey, keep an eye on these guys! If they
try anything funny, shoot them right there!

23
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,983
Kuririn!

24
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:48,319
Now's our chance!
Save me, quickly!

25
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,654
Y- yeah. Gohan...

26
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,985
Right.

27
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,668
No! No! No!
Absolutely no way!

28
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,614
Oww!! Oww!!

29
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:18,950
I haven't even stuck you yet.

30
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,946
My, my, Goku is positively
hopeless over this sort of thing.

31
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,626
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

32
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:32,297
I told you, I haven't stuck you yet.

33
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:36,634
Good grief. For someone who's
always doin' push-ups and sit-ups,

34
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,304
what are you so upset over
somethin' as small as this for?

35
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:40,305
Chichi...

36
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,973
Hmph! How embarrassin'.

37
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:46,637
Compared to the sufferin' Gohan went through,
that pain should be nothin' at all.

38
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:54,475
I'm goin' to go pace a hundred times
in front of the shrine for Gohan-<i>chan</i>'s sake.

39
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:01,593
Chichi...

40
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,652
And stickum...

41
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,287
What are you doing!?
Hurry it up!

42
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,956
Right... but...

43
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,292
Any ship that goes into a meteor
swarm like this won't last long,

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,294
no matter how tough it is!

45
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,963
If we don't hurry,
we won't be spared, either!

46
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:43,301
But that's why we can't just leave
these needy people like this...

47
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,134
Who are you calling needy people!?

48
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:14,265
Are you okay?

49
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,596
All right!

50
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,278
W- who are these guys?

51
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,620
Somebody help!

52
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,288
Oh, no!

53
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,119
Take care of things here!

54
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:47,287
Geez, you two are just
too nice to others...

55
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,793
Hey! What kind of piloting is that!?

56
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:10,588
Which one is-? Damn!

57
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,591
I can't stand to watch this! Move it!

58
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:15,593
What are you doing!?

59
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:18,930
Let me do this. I'm a pro
at this sort of thing, after all.

60
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,932
How can we trust you!?

61
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,934
W- we don't need your help!

62
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:27,271
Letting me do this is better
than getting everyone killed, right?

63
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:32,176
Let's see... this and this controls
the ascent, and this is left and right.

64
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:34,337
Which one is the speed control?

65
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,618
Hurry up and tell me!
You don't want to die, do you!?

66
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,287
T- the keys on the left side.

67
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,686
Okay.

68
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,317
Awesome!

69
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,181
Looks like we somehow
managed to pull through, huh?

70
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:53,291
W- what is this?
Don't you trust us yet?

71
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,626
How can we ever trust you!?

72
00:08:55,626 --> 00:09:00,029
Your pals are the ones who
destroyed our planet, after all!

73
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,320
What do you mean, our pals?

74
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,322
Hmph, don't play dumb!

75
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:27,658
You guys are Freeza's
men, aren't you?

76
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:29,327
Freeza?

77
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,158
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

78
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,665
Help me out here, Kuririn.

79
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:37,668
These kids still seem
to have us all wrong.

80
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,670
We don't have anything wrong!

81
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,675
We were convinced when we saw
that barbaric power you have!

82
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,344
Barbaric, he says?

83
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,346
That's mean.

84
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:51,682
I will admit that those
two are barbarians,

85
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:54,685
but I am a sincere person,
who loves peace and justice.

86
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:55,686
N- now hold on...

87
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:58,356
How can we believe
what you're saying!?

88
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:00,291
Hold it!

89
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,626
Z- Zeshin...

90
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:04,629
Guys, it's okay for you
to put your guns down.

91
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,533
Why, Zeshin!? These guys
are Freeza's men!

92
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:11,969
Their pals are the ones
who killed our moms and dads!

93
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:15,640
If they were Freeza's men,
they wouldn't have saved us.

94
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,643
They would have just suddenly come
attacking us, and have killed us all.

95
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:21,979
That's right. Before,
they came without warning,

96
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:26,313
and killed Dad and Mom without
saying anything, didn't they!?

97
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,315
Maybe so, but...

98
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,663
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

99
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,297
You've got a nice look in your eyes.

100
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,137
Bun...

101
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,314
Thanks for believing us.

102
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,318
Then again, those guys sound
just like Saiyans, huh?

103
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:39,991
Say, by any chance, did the guys
that attacked you have tails?

104
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,994
Tails? No, they didn't have those.

105
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,997
I- I see. Then they weren't Saiyans, huh?

106
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:50,334
Which would mean that there are
other bad folks out here in space.

107
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,168
So, what happened to your planet?

108
00:11:56,007 --> 00:12:01,279
Our planet was peaceful,
and a very easy place to live.

109
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,839
Until <i>they</i> came!

110
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:25,303
Those guys appeared before
us without any warning.

111
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,306
They said they were going to
deliver our world to Freeza-<i>sama</i>,

112
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,641
and that we should be thankful.

113
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:37,982
And then they suddenly started killing
our dads and moms like they were worms.

114
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:41,652
They were going to kill all
the people who were on the planet,

115
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,314
and turn it over to Freeza!

116
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:51,996
I'm surprised you guys survived.

117
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:58,336
The adults who realized what Freeza's
scheme was had us escape in spaceships.

118
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:03,607
But all of the other spaceships were
chased down by Freeza, and shot down!

119
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,278
So this mirror-clad spaceship
is the only one that survived.

120
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:14,618
Mirror-clad spaceship? I see,
so the mirrors reflect outer space.

121
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:18,611
That explains why we couldn't
see the shape of your ship, either.

122
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:29,633
So where are you guys going now?
Do you have any destination?

123
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:34,638
Yeah, there's a planet where our dads
used to travel to on business long ago.

124
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,641
We're sure that they will take us in.

125
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,310
Is this planet far away?

126
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,474
Not to worry. We'll get to that planet,
no matter how many years it takes.

127
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,661
Hang in there, all right?

128
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,597
Yeah. You guys, too.

129
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,825
Right.

130
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:08,606
Okay, let's go. We've lost quite
a bit of time, so we need to hurry.

131
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:13,277
Oh, that's okay, isn't it?
Planet Namek isn't going anywhere.

132
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:17,281
Planet Namek? Are you guys
going to Planet Namek?

133
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,617
That's right. You know it?

134
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:23,287
We passed it about two weeks ago.

135
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:28,959
If you go straight in the direction KS-162,
there should be quite a shortcut.

136
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,961
Huh? You mean it?

137
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,963
Y- yeah...

138
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:38,302
The direction KS-162, right?
Thank you! Come on, we're going.

139
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:39,963
Bye-bye.

140
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:43,967
Oh, but that shortcut is...

141
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,981
Well, they're gone.

142
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,988
They were nice folks, huh?

143
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:59,649
Bun...

144
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:11,268
Okay, we'll hurry on, too!

145
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:14,260
All right! Guys, let's go!

146
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:23,948
Take direction KS-162
and head to Planet Namek.

147
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,951
That's a bit of a relief, huh?

148
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:27,952
What's the matter?

149
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:32,289
Oh, I'm just worried about the other
bad aliens those kids talked about.

150
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,625
But they weren't the Saiyans, right?

151
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,295
However, the Saiyans did have allies.

152
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:41,632
They've got nothing to do with us.

153
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:45,970
Well, I'm going to bed.
I'm completely exhausted.

154
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,636
<i>However, Kuririn's concerns</i>
<i>were by no means off the mark.</i>

155
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:57,478
<i>Eighteen days after Vegeta left Earth...</i>

156
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,815
All right, here...

157
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,592
Something is coming!

158
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,593
Is it Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

159
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,596
It couldn't be! He just left!

160
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,266
I- it's an older model.
It's a soldier.

161
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,602
That signal is Vegeta-<i>sama</i>'s.

162
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,438
That's strange. We didn't get
any word that he was returning.

163
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,940
Could something have happened to him?

164
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,610
Hey, this is the control room!
Vegeta-<i>sama</i> is arriving!

165
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,601
Fall out to greet him at once!

166
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,618
He's here.

167
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,610
There's just one pod,
all right. Where's Nappa-<i>san</i>?

168
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,637
What's the matter?
He's not coming out.

169
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,640
H- hey, his life signs are awfully low.

170
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,130
What?

171
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:02,246
He's using the life-support equipment!

172
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:05,147
This is bad! Hurry and take him
to the treatment center!

173
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:32,610
W- w- what is that!?

174
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,168
An earthquake?

175
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:43,621
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, has something
happened to cause this shaking!?

176
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,689
You guys make light of outer space,

177
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,625
so that's why you're so
surprised by something like this.

178
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,026
This is a shortcut, so it's
going to be a little bumpy.

179
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:05,864
How can she sleep through
a situation like this?

180
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:35,333
I- it's settled down.

181
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,281
That was mean, Bulma-<i>san</i>.

182
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,284
I didn't think that <i>you</i>
would try anything like this!

183
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,953
No, you misunderstand, Bulma-<i>san</i>!

184
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:55,186
How would you know!? You're a student
of that Old Man Turtle, too, after all!

185
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,299
Poor Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

186
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,199
Look at that!

187
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:10,974
We made it! We've arrived
at Planet Namek!

188
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:14,478
That was fast, huh?
It's only been about ten days.

189
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:16,647
That's what a shortcut will do for you.

190
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,649
Is that really...

191
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,317
...Planet Namek?

192
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:25,311
Sure it is. Isn't it obvious?
Just like those kids said.

193
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:38,329
<i>Bulma and the others had arrived in no time.</i>
<i>But was this really Planet Namek?</i>
