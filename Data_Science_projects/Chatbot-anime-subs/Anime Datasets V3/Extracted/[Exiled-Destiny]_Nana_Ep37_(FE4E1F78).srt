1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,330
They say that the more you fight,
the closer you are.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,470
But fighting is nothing
but a clash of egos.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,440
Revealing your true feelings

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,530
doesn't necessarily make people
understand each other better.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,780
I think it's probably impossible
to live your life without getting hurt,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,780
but I also think an effort should
be made not to hurt others.

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,490
I just felt so strongly about that.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,090
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,960
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,810
Baby I'm standing alone

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,610
An unforgettable rainy day

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,620
Chasing after your shadow

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,490
And it's over, it's like sand now

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,790
I sigh every night

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,820
I scream like a child and cried

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,560
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,620
Please, please God, forgive my sins

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,360
I don't need to hide no more

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,300
Flowing toward the turquoise light

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,340
Just keep going on

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,940
You've got the chance now

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,140
You've got the power

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,650
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,280
I show you my life now

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
I show you my love now

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,950
I show you my everything yeah yeah

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,190
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

28
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,990
Don't ever change so be yourself

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,430
I'll show you my strength now

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,790
I'll show you my love now

31
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,060
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,090
Baby don't be afraid

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,740
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,430
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,210
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,110
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
FROM: HACHI
DATE: 09/11
SUBJECT: GOOD MORNING

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:32,280
THANKS FOR CALLING ME
LAST NIGHT. I WAS REALLY HAPPY
TO HEAR FROM YOU, SO I'M SORRY
FOR HANGING UP ON YOU
SO ABRUPTLY. I THOUGHT LONG
AND HARD AFTER THAT,
AND REALIZED THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
THERE ARE ALSO SOME THINGS
I WISH TO ASK YOU. IF YOU HAVE

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,160
Good morning, Reira.
Did you sleep well?

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,570
Yes. My head is clear, perhaps because
I didn't take any medication.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,640
Is that so? That's good, since you have
to talk to a lot of people today.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,810
A lot?

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,540
Yes. In the morning,

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,170
you have an interview with
a women's magazine here in this hotel.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,780
In the afternoon, we change locations

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,850
and all band members will
give interviews

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,870
to three music magazines and
two information magazines.

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,740
In the evening, you have
two radio show recordings.

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,620
I'm so sorry for scheduling
all this for one day.

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,280
No, the recording got delayed
all because of me.

51
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,090
I'm really sorry.

52
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,060
It's okay.

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,700
Can I take a shower?
Do we still have time?

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,530
Yes. The hair and make-up people
are scheduled to be here in thirty minutes.

55
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you wish to do about breakfast?

56
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,940
Just order something
from room service.

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,830
Yes.

58
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,430
You forgot it on purpose, didn't you?

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,450
I had a day off from work that day,

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,780
so I spent the day sleeping peacefully
in Ren's arms for the first time in days.

61
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,550
I woke up feeling that
my troubles had disappeared.

62
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,860
Damn, I left my umbrella at Ren's place.

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,060
Tell him that I won't be seeing him
for a while.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,060
Knowing Nobu,
he probably never told him.

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,670
That guy's really useless.

66
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,070
Is your pride that important to you?

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,680
Here, here.

68
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,920
I doubt I'll be able to erase
the complicated feelings I have

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,090
towards Trapnest's Ren unless
I make it big with my singing career.

70
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,340
But the reason I always end up letting
things like this happen when we meet

71
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,700
is because I love him.

72
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,000
It's as simple as that.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,810
The strawberry glasses weren't
in the kitchen cupboard.

74
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,550
I couldn't imagine Hachi taking
my glass too,

75
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,060
so I figured the glass must've
broken after all,

76
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,550
which made me feel uneasy.

77
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,430
Actually, both glasses were broken.

78
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,320
Huh?

79
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,830
Takumi told me.

80
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,930
He said, "Your woman is terribly brutal.
You've gotta discipline her."

81
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,070
Discipline me?

82
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,170
When Hachiko saw them broken,
she was so shocked she started crying.

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,210
Takumi apparently had a tough time
trying to calm her down.

84
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,650
Given the situation, it's normal to think
that you broke them out of anger.

85
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,350
In reality, it's not likely that
both would break by accident.

86
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,990
It's natural that Hachi would wanna
move out without saying anything.

87
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,060
All the more if those glasses
were precious to her.

88
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,600
It's more than enough to
give her the message

89
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,930
that you're ending your relationship.

90
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,500
What am I gonna do?
That wasn't my intention at all.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
Then what was your intention?

92
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,530
I don't know.

93
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,710
You really don't remember?

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,080
And you don't remember sinking
your phone in the water.

95
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,220
Sorry. After you went to the trouble
of getting that phone for me.

96
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,840
Something was wrong with me.

97
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,620
It's all right.

98
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,450
If you need a cell phone,
we can buy another one.

99
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,520
But I lost all the phone numbers
and email addresses I had.

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,520
I should've kept a memo.

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,600
Well, the few friends you have
are mostly my friends too, so...

102
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,090
...wanna copy the numbers?

103
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,000
That's right.

104
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,070
It needs to be recharged.

105
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,340
Charge it right now!

106
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,910
YOU'RE SO LAME!

107
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,710
YOU'RE SO LAME!
No, I gotta get going.

108
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,340
You're practicing again at
the studio tonight too, right?

109
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,710
Ask the guys directly
when you're there.

110
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,050
But I've gotta call her right away.

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,950
Rather than calling her, go see her.

112
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,130
Hachi's struggling with morning sickness
and it's raining.

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,490
She's probably home.

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
SUITE 302
SHIROGANE
SHIROGANE 7-CHOME
MINATO-KU

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,130
SUITE 302
SHIROGANE
SHIROGANE 7-CHOME
MINATO-KU
Shirogane... 302?
That's the same number as Ren's place.

116
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,470
Shirogane... 302?
That's the same number as Ren's place.

117
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,540
Ren! Give me a ride to the station!

118
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,340
To Shirogane-dai station?

119
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,480
No, the station over there.
I've gotta buy those glasses.

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,890
No matter how many times
I think it over,

121
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,250
I can't get over how careless I was.

122
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,990
But with the rain getting stronger

123
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,430
and the restlessness of not
having an umbrella

124
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,390
added to the anxiety of wanting
to hurry and see Hachiko.

125
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,520
How lucky! Is this the rain of grace?

126
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,430
The trigger that alters someone's fate
can be pulled in an instant.

127
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,040
Hello, Mrs. Ichinose.

128
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
MRS. ICHINOSE
Are you going out?

129
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,180
MRS. ICHINOSE
Yes. Can you please
call a taxi for me?

130
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,580
Yes. Can you please
call a taxi for me?

131
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,780
Certainly. Where to?

132
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,810
To the Shirogane-dai station.

133
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,500
SHIROGANE 7-14

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,110
SHIROGANE 7-14
This isn't good, I don't have a clue.

135
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,330
This isn't good, I don't have a clue.

136
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,300
It should be somewhere around here.
Twenty minutes from the station?

137
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,210
I feel like I've been walking
for an hour.

138
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,710
Excuse me.

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
I need to get to this address.
Would you know the way?

140
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,850
I should just act normally.
As if nothing ever happened.

141
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,630
Hachi thinks that I'm taking Nobu's side
and am therefore furious,

142
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,220
taking a stand for justice.

143
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,530
Because she thinks of me
as some hero.

144
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,870
So I must teach her that a true hero
always stands by the heroine,

145
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,810
no matter what happens.

146
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,310
Sorry, Nobuo.

147
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,060
I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
UNTIL 7 O'CLOCK AT
THE TICKET GATE
OF SHIROGANE-DAI STATION.
NANA

148
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,190
Um, excuse me.

149
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,670
It seems that the person
I've come to see is not here.

150
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,940
Can you please give this to her
when she returns?

151
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,070
Of course.
Who is it to, and of which suite?

152
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,740
Suite 302...

153
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,850
Suite 302 is presently vacant.

154
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,980
Could you have the wrong suite number?

155
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,420
302 is the same number
as Ren's place.

156
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,090
I definitely don't have
the wrong number.

157
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,210
Excuse me.

158
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,500
Smoking is not permitted
in the restaurant.

159
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,720
Nana Komatsu?

160
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,190
There's no one by
that name living here.

161
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,250
That's impossible!
She just moved here recently!

162
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,620
Why, of course.
It's under Takumi's name.

163
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,190
What's Takumi's surname?

164
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,760
Or, is Takumi his real name
to begin with?

165
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,830
I have no idea what
Takumi's real name is!

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,370
Takumi of Trapnest and his woman
live in suite 302, don't they?!

167
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,840
There's no use hiding it.
I already know.

168
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,440
There's no one living here
that matches that description.

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,580
TAKUMI ICHINOSE
NANA

FROM RETURNING.
There's no one living here

00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:56,940
TAKUMI ICHINOSE
NANA
CAUTION: DO NOT ACCEPT
MESSAGES FROM ANY VISITORS

TELL ANYONE SUSPICIOUS THAT
THE APARTMENT IS VACANT

171
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,610
TAKUMI ICHINOSE
NANA
CAUTION: DO NOT ACCEPT

TELL ANYONE SUSPICIOUS THAT
THE APARTMENT IS VACANT

Excuse me, but could you please leave?

172
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,710
TAKUMI ICHINOSE
NANA
CAUTION: DO NOT ACCEPT
MESSAGES FROM ANY VISITORS
WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT.
TELL ANYONE SUSPICIOUS THAT
THE APARTMENT IS VACANT
TO DISCOURAGE THEM

173
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,820
Damn it!

174
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,450
I bet that guy mistook me
for a fan of Takumi.

175
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,310
Of all people, Takumi!

176
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,050
Suite 302 is presently vacant.

177
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,160
A peremptory measure.

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,490
Takumi would think of that kind
of method to get rid of someone.

179
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,330
Sure, if confronted in that way many
would think they made a mistake.

180
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,440
And since people believe
it is a vacant room,

181
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,310
Hachi, living her life here carefree,

182
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,840
would be like a ghost
unaware that she is already dead.

183
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,850
She'd exist only for Takumi
and the child she's having.

184
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,090
Hey, Hachi.
Are you really all right with that?

185
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,630
What? You're getting married?

186
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,450
Yes.

187
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,120
Are you pregnant?

188
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,390
You're really good at figuring out
such things.

189
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,800
That's the only reason that
comes to mind,

190
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,860
that would lead Takumi to propose.

191
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,640
But is that really Takumi's child?

192
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,140
Probably.

193
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,840
Have an abortion.

194
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,010
You should tell Takumi the truth
and break up with him.

195
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,660
The thought that you'll earn happiness
just by getting married

196
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,020
is only an illusion.

197
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,690
Of course,
Takumi knows everything.

198
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,590
He knows and he's still marrying you?!
That sounds unbelievable!

199
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,670
Huh? But, well, I can
go through with this

200
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,630
because we accept each other
even after knowing stuff about that.

201
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,700
Am I weird? And Takumi
is a weird person too.

202
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,120
No. I don't really know what's weird
and what's not about anything,

203
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,780
so don't worry about anything I say.

204
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,690
You think maybe your family situation
has some similarities

205
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,750
with the position I'm in now?

206
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,860
I think the reason people are keeping
my situation a secret from only you is,

207
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,070
of course partly because
they don't wanna talk about me,

208
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,840
but I think it's also because
they don't wanna open up

209
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,430
any scars you have from the past.

210
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,880
I also intended to keep it
a secret from you,

211
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,140
because I knew you would be
against me keeping it.

212
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,320
But then I thought that's all
the more reason why

213
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
I should tell you everything.

214
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,890
I'm sure your mother went through
a lot of agony like I did,

215
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,980
but still wanted to have you, Shin.

216
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,390
I know that much.
Stop treating me like a child.

217
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,330
I'M SORRY

218
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,470
Then I want to hear from you

219
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,630
what made you feel that your mother
should never have given birth to you.

220
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,940
I don't ever want my own child
saying something like that.

221
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,980
But if the child is not Takumi's,
I'm sure that would be agonizing for him.

222
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,990
And the child would eventually
think it strange

223
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,650
if they don't look alike or
their blood types were different.

224
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,500
But even so, I believe we can still be
a happy family if we try,

225
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,330
or at least I'd like to at least hope so.

226
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,730
Am I being naïve?

227
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,240
I think so.

228
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,810
But really, don't mind what I say.

229
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,780
Even if there are some similarities,

230
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,010
things will be different if the people
involved are different.

231
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,050
You've just gotta do what
you believe is right.

232
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,680
Yeah. I'm sorry.

233
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,830
I wish I'd been born
as your child, Hachi.

234
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,900
Shinichi Okazaki's mother committed
suicide shortly after Shin was born.

235
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,080
The truth about Shin's biological father
may be lost forever.

236
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,520
I can investigate further if you wish,
but you've gotta realize

237
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,550
it's a case about one individual
and it happened overseas.

238
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,550
No, this is more than enough
for a great story.

239
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,890
I'd rather have you investigate
the whereabouts of Nana's mother.

240
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,030
Thank you as usual.

241
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,730
But unless BLAST becomes big,
won't this go to waste?

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,170
Just watch. There's no doubt about it.
They'll be big.

243
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,870
But it appears that Gaia has
no intention of letting them debut.

244
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,870
I'll make it happen.

245
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,070
Even if they were to debut,
they won't sell.

246
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,080
A visually attractive band
may attract fad followers,

247
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
but that will repel the real music lovers.

248
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,880
- And, these songs aren't what...
- Stop talking like some music critic!

249
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,020
What the people want never changes!

250
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,780
They want a stimulating topic!

251
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,660
And yet the young brats of today
just don't get it.

252
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,500
They all believe they're some great artist,
it makes me sick.

253
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,890
A world where "honor student" bands
like Trapnest reign is as sleepy as hell!

254
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,370
I would just love to break that nose of
Takumi that he proudly sticks up high.

255
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,500
Anyway, I look forward
to tomorrow's party.

256
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,510
We'll open everyone's eyes.

257
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
Huh? But "Search" isn't on the shelves
until the day after tomorrow, right?

258
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,380
I sold half of the information
to TV networks.

259
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,090
They were really into my scenario
and practically handed over their wallets.

260
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,060
It wasn't about getting a scoop, huh?

261
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,850
My objective is to increase
magazine sales!

262
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,130
Get the people excited with news
about their love affair,

263
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,370
and the people will jump
at the precious photo!

264
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,390
You got a picture of them together?

265
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,030
It looks great.

266
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:32,780
That day, I waited for Hachi in front
of her place until sunset,

267
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,410
but I couldn't see her.

268
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,180
I'll come again tomorrow after work.

269
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,350
I have a little time before
I go to the studio.

270
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,060
I'll get her phone number from Yasu,

271
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,750
so we don't miss each other
like this again.

272
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,360
It's not like I'll never see her again.

273
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,700
There's always tomorrow.

274
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,100
Sorry to keep you for so long.

275
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,570
I'm so glad we got the chance to
talk about all kinds of stuff.

276
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,910
Housewives are craving for
the chance to talk to people.

277
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't remain at home thinking only
about the baby in your tummy.

278
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,370
You need to get in touch with
the outside world.

279
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,940
But the only plans I have to go out
are shopping and checkups.

280
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,520
Why don't you take lessons
on something?

281
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,980
You'd also make housewife friends
that way.

282
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,020
Great idea.

283
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,380
Good luck with your practice, Shin.

284
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,260
Personally, I think some things
are impossible to achieve,

285
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,560
no matter how much you practice.

286
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,960
That's not true!

287
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,460
I believe that BLAST will become
the best band in Japan someday!

288
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,300
Well then, Madam, we'll meet again
when your husband's not around.

289
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,510
Yes.

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,730
Shin!

291
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,900
How is Nobu?

292
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,680
He keeps playing his guitar!
It's so noisy I can't get any sleep!

293
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,150
I can't wait until dawn.

294
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,660
I hope it'll be sunny tomorrow.

295
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Ouch!

296
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,940
Oh, sorry. You're home.

297
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,640
Seven o'clock?

298
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,610
He just got to bed. I'm amazed how
he can get up and go to work.

299
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,230
What are you watching a video
of yourself so early in the morning?

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,870
No. We're on TV.

301
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,010
Oh, how nice.

302
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,230
Is this "Channel Nana"?

303
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,650
Wake up! There is no such channel!

304
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,680
MORNING 7
Wake up! There is no such channel!

305
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,340
MORNING 7

306
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,750
Good morning!
It's time for Morning Seven!

307
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,120
REN HONJO (22)
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!
Good morning!
It's time for Morning Seven!

308
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,550
REN HONJO (22)
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!

309
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,450
REN HONJO (22)
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!
We have learned about Trapnest's
guitarist, Ren's passionate love affair!

310
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,960
The woman is a member of his former
band, and vocalist of "Black Stones,"

311
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,720
a band on the brink of
a major debut with Gaia Records.

312
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,860
Her name, Nana!

313
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,040
Ever since that day when
the thick clouds passed

314
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,470
and I was suddenly in the spotlight...

315
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,210
The place we were standing was
not a stage, but the center of a ring.

316
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,990
I can still hear the cheers and
jeers ringing in my head.

317
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,310
Loud and annoying.

318
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,930
I can't count
how many nights

319
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,700
I wished tomorrow
would never come

320
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:25,470
To live as I am
without being fake

321
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,070
What do I need

322
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:37,220
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

323
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,390
The answer is
too close to see

324
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,630
Black tears are
falling down

325
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,570
I have nothing,
only sadness

326
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,670
I can't put it
into words

327
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,740
My whole body
starts to ache

328
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,160
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
