1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,270
That night Nana
took Misato by the hand

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,130
and left the flat
without saying a word.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,570
She didn't return until morning.

4
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,170
When I was darkness at that time

5
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,000
With trembling lips

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,100
In a corner of a room I cry

7
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,180
The more I struggle

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,020
The more this wound deepens

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,180
The broken promise hurt me

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,910
Nobody can save me

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,090
God, I have only one request

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,720
Stop tearing apart my love

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,070
I need your love

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm a broken rose

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,240
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,410
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

17
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,180
I need your love

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,480
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,420
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,380
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,350
I wanna need your love

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,590
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,920
I wanna need your love

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,490
- Yes.
- It's me.

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,830
What is it, so early in the morning?

26
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,200
Same goes for you.
What's up with that outfit?

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,700
Are you going to work already?

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,740
No, I came back from work
and continued working.

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,850
Work? But it was a public holiday.
Law firms can be really busy, huh?

30
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,460
When do you get any sleep?

31
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,060
I was gonna take a nap
before going back to work.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,790
I'm coming in.

33
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,200
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,780
I was hanging out with Misato
in her hotel room,

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,680
but a single bed just isn't
big enough for two people.

36
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,170
That girl's still here?
What about school?

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,920
She says her school is
full of floozies

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
and she has no real friends,
so she doesn't wanna go.

39
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,280
But her parents must be worried.

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,980
That girl looks like the princess-type
from a wealthy family, after all.

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,290
Actually, I hear they don't really care.
It's like what Shin was saying.

42
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,060
Maybe she'll end up
running away from home.

43
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,540
Shin... He's becoming quite a handful.

44
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,040
I just hope he doesn't
get in trouble.

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,170
He's taken on a different appearance
as of late.

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,970
Talk about appearance, Yasu.

47
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,080
I've been thinking
for some time now...

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,600
you've got this frightening look
without your sunglasses.

49
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,740
Shut up.

50
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,980
Usually it's the other way around.

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,690
Either way, it's not
the look of a lawyer.

52
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,220
Nana... If you're gonna sleep,
go sleep at your own place.

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,990
Wanna sleep with me?

54
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,030
What are you saying?

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't mess with me.

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,750
Then I'm leaving.

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,410
Wait.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,760
You wanted to talk to me
about something, didn't you?

59
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,080
What happened?

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,870
Sorry for coming without a reason.
Good night.

61
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,140
Nana!

62
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,980
I return to work today,
so I'd better get some sleep.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Or so I thought,
but I couldn't get any sleep.

64
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,890
Nana!

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,890
I didn't mean to say the things I said.

67
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,270
Just, some things happened,

68
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,930
and I was irritated,
and I guess I took it out on you.

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm really sorry.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
Are you mad at me?

71
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,010
I'm not mad, really.

72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,780
Just like you said, I got carried away
and just did as I wanted.

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Then why didn't you come home
until the morning?

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Nana, you don't carry a cell phone,
and I just didn't know what to do.

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,860
I kept thinking about it
and couldn't get any sleep!

76
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,450
Am I your boyfriend or something?!

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,190
You're more important to me
than a boyfriend.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,890
By the way, what happened
to Misato?

79
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,750
Did she go home?

80
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,830
No. She's at the hotel sleeping.

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,990
She said that she might go home
after she checks out at noon today.

82
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,430
Is that so? What should I do?

83
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,440
About what?

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,900
She must think I'm such a bitch.
She didn't do anything wrong.

85
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,250
She was having so much fun
and I ruined it all.

86
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,240
I want to apologize.

87
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,080
Say, does she have a cell phone?

88
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,220
Yeah, she does.

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,120
Give me her number.
I'll give her a call.

90
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,620
Sure, but she's likely still asleep,
so wait until after noon.

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,520
Mhm!

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,490
Hold on a moment.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
I have it written down somewhere.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Hey, Nana. What time
can you make it home today?

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,030
Give me some breathing room!

96
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,630
Can we have dinner together?

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,360
That's fine with me,
but it'll be like nine tonight.

98
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,670
Then I'll cook something
to make it up to you.

99
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,010
Here.

100
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,970
Thanks.

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,870
I'm off!

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,780
What should I cook for dinner?

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I ended up not making
those hamburgers last night,

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,090
so maybe hamburgers.

105
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,620
I wonder what that girl made for Shoji.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,850
What are you looking at,
Miss Komatsu?

107
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,100
The office computer is not
to be used for playing around.

108
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Y-You're mistaken, Ms. Sakagami.
I was thinking about a new project.

109
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,910
What do you think about
having a segment on cooking?

110
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,610
The readers of our magazine
aren't all women!

111
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,510
But in this day and age men need
to know more about cooking, too.

112
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,210
Don't talk back to me. Besides,
you don't have the experience

113
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,180
to be talking about new projects.

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,580
All you need to do is complete
the tasks you've been given.

115
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,420
What's with her?
She's treating me like some servant.

116
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,050
Though in a way I am one...

117
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,190
Where are you going, Miss Komatsu?!

118
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm going for lunch!

119
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
I wanna hurry and quit this job.

120
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,700
But I need to find my next job
before I do that.

121
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,810
Or else Nana will tell me to move out.
But we just made up.

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,540
That's right! I hafta call Misato.

123
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,220
Hello.

124
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,020
Oh, hello, Misato? It's Nana Komatsu.

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,460
Miss Komatsu? I'm really sorry.
I was being such a nuisance.

126
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,930
No, I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

127
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,300
- Huh?
- I called to apologize about yesterday.

128
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,770
I'm really sorry.
I was not my usual self yesterday.

129
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,470
Um, come visit us
again anytime, okay?

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Nana and the other band members
would be glad to see you.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,170
I'll keep you informed about
their upcoming live concerts.

132
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
Sure! Thank you very much.

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
Where are you now, Misato?

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,980
Oh, I'm on the train, on my way home.

135
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,780
I see. Sorry for not seeing you off.

136
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,280
No, that's okay. I'm grateful as it is.

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,790
Being able to have dinner
with the BLAST band members,

138
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,500
and the chance to talk with Nana...

139
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,990
I'm so happy I could die.
It's like I'm still in some dream.

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,240
You're exaggerating.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,470
No, really. I've been a BLAST fan
since the very beginning,

142
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,030
but nothing like this
has ever happened.

143
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,610
It really is like a dream to me.

144
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,480
I see. When you say since
the very beginning, when was that?

145
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,580
It was with the first set of members,
back when Ren was in the band.

146
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,550
So, almost four years ago?

147
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,380
First members,
when Ren was in the band?

148
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,010
No way, it can't be this Ren.

149
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,930
It was a shock when Ren left BLAST,
but don't you think Shin,

150
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,190
the new bassist,
plays just like Ren does?

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,530
So at the live concert it was like
a revival of the BLAST of old times.

152
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,960
I was really thrilled.

153
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,770
Name a guitarist you respect.

154
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,160
Ren Honjo!

155
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,380
Oh, which reminds me,

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,110
I'll be going back home soon
to catch Trapnest play live.

157
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,340
I'm so happy that I'll have the chance
to see Ren perform in person again.

158
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,880
That's the flower of the lotus, isn't it?
Why did you choose the lotus?

159
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,120
Actually, it's the ren.

160
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,820
Ren...

161
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,330
No way.

162
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,600
I need to calm down.

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,660
I need to calm down and think.

164
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,500
Trapnest's Ren is
BLAST's former bassist?

165
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,100
Judging from what Misato said,
there's no mistake about it, is there?

166
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,400
But why? Not one of them
said a word about it.

167
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,980
Not even when Shin and I
were talking about Ren.

168
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,750
Then were they keeping it a secret?

169
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,090
Furthermore, if that tattoo
on Nana's arm signifies Ren...

170
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,890
Are Nana and Ren lovers?

171
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,190
They make a great couple!
That's so cool! I get it!

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,730
Ren is a popular celebrity.

173
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,430
Perhaps that's why they're keeping
their affair a secret.

174
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,400
From that perspective, everything
makes more sense now, I think.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,770
Yasu's stoic behavior.

176
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,900
The fact that Nana
avoids talking about herself.

177
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,310
Nana often goes out at night saying
she's going to work,

178
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,180
but she's in fact out to
secretly see Ren.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,250
She goes out wearing
Vivienne Westwood when

180
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,270
she says she's going to work, after all.

181
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,480
Maybe that's what's happening.
I'll bet it is.

182
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,420
What am I gonna do?
I wanna know more!

183
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,660
So much that I couldn't possibly
keep my mind on work.

184
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,920
I hafta find out the truth.

185
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,730
But Nana said she won't be back
until around nine,

186
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,090
and she doesn't carry a cell phone.

187
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,130
What am I gonna do?

188
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,700
Still that's no reason
to come to my place.

189
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,700
Please tell me, Nobu.
You know a lot about this, don't you?

190
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,810
I assure you, I won't sell
the story to the press.

191
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,810
No, I'd never imagine you as a woman
who would do such a thing, Hachi.

192
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,010
Don't call me Hachi!

193
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,080
Shin!

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,190
That'll stunt your growth!
And why are you so calm?

195
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,480
You've always respected Ren, right?!

196
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
Because I already knew.

197
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,830
Why? Did you by chance become
a member of BLAST

198
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,190
knowing you'd be taking Ren's place?

199
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,700
What do you mean?
You had this all planned out?

200
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,860
No. Nobu got drunk and told me.

201
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I did?!

202
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,690
I figured you might not remember.

203
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,470
No way! When?!

204
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,260
Right after I became
a member of BLAST.

205
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,770
Shin. If you knew, why didn't you
tell me anything about it?

206
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,310
Because everyone avoids
talking about Ren,

207
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,970
to the point that it's obvious.

208
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,910
So I figured I'd be better off
pretending I never heard about it.

209
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,740
I'm the worst.

210
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,590
You are such a grown up, Shin.

211
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,290
If it was me, I would never be able to
act like I didn't know anything.

212
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,780
I tend to get all worked up about it,
like I'm doing now.

213
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,960
That's what's so
cute about you, Hachi.

214
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,360
Cute?!

215
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,690
Don't mess around with adults.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,590
I wasn't really messing around.

217
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,870
It's been a long time since
someone said I'm cute.

218
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,800
Hey, Shin, what exactly
have I told you?

219
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,770
I'll tell you everything I know.

220
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,140
I'm afraid I might've told you lies,
since I was drinking then.

221
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,610
Ren was BLAST's bassist.

222
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,750
He and Nana were lovers and they
lived together, but two years ago

223
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,950
he was offered the chance
to become Trapnest's guitarist.

224
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,250
He came to Tokyo alone,
and no one's heard from him since.

225
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,120
So I told him everything.

226
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,890
Wait! No one's heard from him since?
Then what about him and Nana?

227
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,260
They had a tearful breakup, right?

228
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,070
That's right. And there's nothing left
for me to tell you.

229
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,810
Tearful? But just because
Ren came to Tokyo,

230
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,930
that doesn't mean they
had to break up.

231
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,710
You're right. You had
a long distance relationship

232
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,370
with your boyfriend, Hachi,
and it's lasted.

233
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,610
Well, yeah...

234
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,780
Actually, that came to an end
after I came here.

235
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,050
- You broke up with your boyfriend?
- It came to an end?

236
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,590
You're kidding!

237
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,990
But we just went to his workplace
the other day.

238
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,500
Yeah, but... somehow, after that...
Never mind about me.

239
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,020
I'll bitch to you about the whole thing
over some drinks another time.

240
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,960
No. I'm done with alcohol.

241
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,210
Is it something to bitch about?
Did he cheat on you?

242
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,830
Bingo.

243
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,410
A-Anyway, right now we're talking
about why Nana and Ren broke up.

244
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,170
I suggest you talk to Nana directly
about their reasons for breaking up.

245
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,850
No, that wouldn't be good!

246
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,220
Why's that?

247
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,560
Listen, everyone's got
a couple of painful memories

248
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,890
they'd rather not share with anyone.

249
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,090
Is it that painful of a memory?

250
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,830
But if they broke up in tears,

251
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,460
that would mean they were
doing great until then, right?

252
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,090
That's right, but, how can I say it...

253
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,140
I don't hate Ren
and I don't wanna badmouth him,

254
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,340
but Ren decided to leave BLAST
and join Trapnest

255
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,110
without talking it over
with Nana or myself.

256
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,950
Only Yasu knew about it.

257
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,950
So at that time, I really felt betrayed,
and it was a great shock.

258
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,660
As a fellow musician,
my pride was shot down

259
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,620
and I couldn't shake off
this feeling of utter defeat.

260
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,060
But both Nana and I
acknowledged Ren's talents

261
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,120
and we respected that.

262
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,970
We could predict that this would be
better for Ren's sake,

263
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,330
and of course,
that proved to be true.

264
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,770
I believe this was the best outcome.
But Nana...

265
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,910
Back then, she could've gone with him
if she desired.

266
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,420
But rather than choose happiness
as a woman,

267
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,440
she chose to protect her pride.

268
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,190
I think that's the reason why she's so
insistent on succeeding as a musician,

269
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,350
no matter what.

270
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,760
She has her heart set on
someday reaching

271
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,960
the level of success Ren...
Trapnest is enjoying.

272
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,590
Shin, do better than Ren.

273
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,530
Sometimes, it pains me
to see her like that.

274
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,080
To be honest, I can't be sure
whether or not Nana

275
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,980
still has feelings for Ren,
but both Yasu and I feel awkward

276
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,710
talking about Ren in front of her.

277
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,750
We weren't necessarily keeping it
a secret from you.

278
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,960
So both of you,
there's no need

279
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,630
for you to act like
you don't know anything,

280
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,360
but I don't want you asking her
about this just to satisfy your curiosity.

281
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I understand. But I must've mentioned
Ren many times in front on Nana.

282
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,010
Miss Komatsu! It's already 3 o'clock!

283
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,040
- Then I was hurting Nana's pride
- How far did you go for lunch?!

284
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,350
- every time I mentioned Trapnest.
- My goodness!

285
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,880
- Although I knew nothing about this,
- Your stance toward your work

286
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,350
- I feel bad about it.
- is not right! You're practically

287
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,450
- I'm gonna stop asking her
- stealing your salary

288
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,750
- to come to the live concert with me.
- from the company! Excuse me!

289
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,420
- Naturally, she won't wanna go
- Are you listening, Miss Komatsu?!

290
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,890
to a Trapnest live concert.

291
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,180
It's okay as long as you're
feeling remorse. I went a bit too far.

292
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,390
Just be careful this
doesn't happen again, okay?

293
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,330
That's right. In order not to
hurt her again.

294
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,270
I'll cautiously but casually bring
the subject of Ren up.

295
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,370
Did Yasu come?

296
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,610
Huh?

297
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,480
This is Yasu's, right?
There's no other guy who would

298
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,610
smoke those odd cigarettes
with that distinctive smell.

299
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,110
So they do have a distinctive smell?

300
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,850
I always thought it had
a nice, sweet scent.

301
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,110
Really?

302
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,820
But these aren't Yasu's.
They're Shin's.

303
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,160
I confiscated them from him.

304
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,690
Huh? What is it with Shin?

305
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,000
There's no sense in me
holding onto them,

306
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,060
so go ahead and smoke them, Nana.

307
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,560
No, I don't care for these.

308
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,700
Leave them here and Yasu will
smoke them when he's here.

309
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,100
Wait a minute.
When did you see Shin?

310
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,410
I bumped into him when I was
coming home from work.

311
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,370
Oh?

312
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,550
What am I doing lying to her?
I should just tell her the truth.

313
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,210
There's something fishy here.
Don't go after Shin.

314
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,050
To him, a working woman is
a woman to get money from.

315
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,660
Even if that woman is you.

316
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
It's nothing like that.

317
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,520
Then that's fine.

318
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,220
By the way, did you call Misato?

319
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,530
It was with the first set of members,
back when Ren was in the band.

320
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,100
Yeah.

321
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,860
I wonder if she got back all right.

322
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,700
Mhm. She said she was
on the train on her way home.

323
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm glad to hear that.

324
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,120
You know, Nana.
About Ren of Trapnest...

325
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,080
This is about the live concert, right?

326
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,610
Sure. I'll go.

327
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,450
Huh? Why?

328
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,650
I told you I'd go if I felt like it.

329
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,320
So what made you feel like going?

330
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,730
No reason. Just felt like it.

331
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,130
But...

332
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,200
What? If you have plans with
someone else, that's fine with me.

333
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,960
N-N-No, let's go together.

334
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,830
I'd be super happy
to go with you, Nana.

335
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,970
Why? Does she want to
see Ren, after all?

336
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
Maybe she still has
feelings for Ren.

337
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,910
I want to ask her.
But I mustn't be hasty about it.

338
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,890
Even if I ask, Nana's not likely
to be direct with me.

339
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,820
She won't give me an honest answer.

340
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
She'll get embarrassed and say

341
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,390
she's changed her mind about
going to the live concert with me.

342
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,690
I wonder if I should ask her
after the live concert.

343
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,060
This is a golden opportunity for them
to get back together.

344
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,630
If I don't watch it I could ruin things.

345
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,870
We have first row seats.

346
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,200
And the concert hall is small.
Ren will surely notice Nana there.

347
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,240
The girl he had a tearful break up with
will suddenly be standing before him.

348
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,680
Ren won't be able to resist
getting closer to her!

349
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,040
They will silently look in
each other's eyes.

350
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,620
Nana's eyes will be filled with tears.

351
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,920
Without a second thought,

352
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,250
Ren will jump down from the stage
and embrace Nana.

353
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,430
Beautiful!

354
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,090
I should keep quiet so
Nana doesn't change her mind.

355
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,490
At least until the concert. I'll do it.
I'll act as if don't know anything.

356
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,100
I am an adult after all.

357
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,030
For the sake of an exciting reunion.

358
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,430
Sure. I'll go along with your story.

359
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,970
I acted like I didn't know
until now anyway.

360
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,470
Thank you, Shin!

361
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,680
But I envy you. First row seats, right?
I'd like to come too.

362
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,580
Yeah, I'm sure you would. I'm sorry.

363
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,010
But I wonder if the reunion will be
as exciting as you're thinking, Hachi.

364
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,460
Well, I agree maybe imagining him
jumping off the stage is a stretch.

365
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,590
Still, I wonder if Ren
still thinks about Nana.

366
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,790
They haven't been in touch
for two years, right?

367
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,440
Yeah. I wonder about that.
To start with, that guy...

368
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,870
"To start with that guy," what?!

369
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,210
Rumor has it he's a real womanizer.

370
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,200
Really?!

371
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,430
Well, but, that's something
from his past.

372
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,080
As far as Nana was concerned,
he was very faithful to her.

373
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,520
Oh, and that necklace Ren's always
wearing? Nana gave that to him.

374
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,290
No way, really?

375
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,080
That's a totally good sign
he still feels for her!

376
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,750
But maybe he just likes it, and there's
no real reason behind him wearing it.

377
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,290
That can't be.

378
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,350
It definitely means something to him.
Hey, Yasu, don't you agree?

379
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah, I do.

380
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,290
I knew it!

381
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,670
What's the matter?

382
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,840
Come on, everyone, practice time.
Let's give it our best today too.

383
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,780
That dampens the mood.

384
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,370
That was two weeks
before the live concert.

385
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,890
As my heart pounded

386
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,850
worrying about the possibility
of Nana changing her mind,

387
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,290
my imagination
just kept escalating.

388
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,890
Should Nana and Ren
get back together,

389
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,230
would that mean
members of Trapnest

390
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,660
could come visit us at our place?

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,230
Then maybe I could
become all lovey-dovey with Takumi.

392
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,560
What am I gonna do?

393
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,670
What's the matter, Miss Komatsu?

394
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,530
Yes.

395
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,090
It's me.

396
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,230
You again?

397
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you want this late at night?

398
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
The morning of the live concert, Nana,

399
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,270
you were sitting by that window
the same as always.

400
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,640
But there was a different scent
in the room.

401
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,120
The scent of Black Stone,

402
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,860
those cigarettes
I confiscated from Shin

403
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,520
that you said you don't care for.

404
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,660
I reached into the sky

405
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:20,170
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

406
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,550
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

407
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,540
Like colorful balloons

408
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,650
I'm alone

409
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,390
My hand had no place to go

410
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,020
And gently you took it

411
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,200
Starless night

412
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,400
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

413
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,200
I want to feel your warmth

414
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,080
Tears are falling down

415
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,170
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

416
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,680
Of your hand holding mine
