Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.77,0:09:16.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Not to mention, she reacted when I referred to how you "sought to die so soon,"
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.47,0:09:19.07,Default,,0,0,0,,which nobody outside the 104th would understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.44,0:09:25.73,Default,,0,0,0,,And mostly because I'm pretty sure she killed Sawney and Bean, the two experimental subjects.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.38,0:09:29.70,Default,,0,0,0,,But why?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.70,0:09:33.74,Default,,0,0,0,,One would need quite the skill to kill those two.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.74,0:09:37.19,Default,,0,0,0,,The culprit would've used their own 3D Maneuver Gear, since they'd be accustomed to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.14,0:09:42.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So that's why we had a gear check? But Annie wasn't caught.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.88,0:09:46.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Because she brought Marco's to the check.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.95,0:09:49.68,Default,,0,0,0,,That's how she passed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.15,0:09:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,What? What does Marco have to do with this?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.32,0:09:58.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.40,0:10:01.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you sure you're not mistaken?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.06,0:10:03.50,Default,,0,0,0,,No, I'm pretty certain.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.50,0:10:08.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I got that, kid. Do you have any other evidence?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.53,0:10:10.27,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.27,0:10:13.87,Default,,0,0,0,,In my opinion, the female-form resembles Annie.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.87,0:10:15.79,Default,,0,0,0,,What? What are you even saying?!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.10,0:10:17.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that all you—
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.69,0:10:20.13,Default,,0,0,0,,So we've got no proof, but we'll still do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.69,0:10:22.72,Default,,0,0,0,,No proof?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.72,0:10:25.48,Default,,0,0,0,,What? Then why?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.48,0:10:27.57,Default,,0,0,0,,What if it isn't Annie?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.57,0:10:30.99,Default,,0,0,0,,If it's not Annie, then she'll be cleared of suspicion.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.67,0:10:34.74,Default,,0,0,0,,True, we'll have put her through a terrible ordeal.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.74,0:10:41.02,Default,,0,0,0,,But if we do nothing, you'll be sacrificed to Central's whims.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.71,0:10:44.44,Default,,0,0,0,,It's just not right to doubt Annie..
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.44,0:10:48.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren, after hearing that it might be Annie, has anything come to mind?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.86,0:11:00.75,Default,,0,0,0,,You fought the female-form in hand-to-hand combat.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.01,0:11:04.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Did she use any of Annie's typical moves?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.36,0:11:30.27,Default,,0,0,0,,You know it too. Annie {\i1}is{\i0} the female-form Titan.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.13,0:11:37.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So why aren't you fighting?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.50,0:11:43.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Are other feelings holding you back?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.42,0:11:44.84,Default,,0,0,0,,What?!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.60,0:11:51.13,Default,,0,0,0,,I've got a plan!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.35,0:11:56.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Mikasa and I will exit that hole and the entrance at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.59,0:11:59.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Annie will have to follow one of us.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.52,0:12:02.65,Default,,0,0,0,,That should buy you time to run the other way!
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.96,0:12:04.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait!
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.57,0:12:07.30,Default,,0,0,0,,That means one of you is going to die!
