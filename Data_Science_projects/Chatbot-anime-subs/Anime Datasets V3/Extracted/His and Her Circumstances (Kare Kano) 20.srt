1
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:03,354
My family was rich.

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:06,467
I was sickly since birth...

3
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:12,071
...and I grew up being loved to death by
my Mom, Dad, and the old butler and nanny.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,339
I was given as much candy
and toys as I wanted...

7
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,771
...but I didn't have any friends.

8
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:24,379
You fatso Takefumi!

9
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:27,582
We're not gonna play with YOU!

10
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:35,928
I even had metabolic
diseases in third grade.

12
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,139
Tonami-kun! Tonami-kun!

13
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,746
Everyone's talking about how
tall and cool you are.

15
00:00:57,253 --> 00:01:00,216
I wonder if it's true that people from
Okinawa all all good looking.

17
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:02,816
My height? Well, I play basketball, so...

18
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:06,486
Playing basketball in Okinawa
that sounds so cool!

20
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:09,663
Besides, I'm not from Okinawa.

21
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:13,199
Oh yeah, you used to
live around here, right?

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,768
Until seventh grade.

23
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:17,097
I have a picture. Want to see?

24
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,304
Yeah, yeah!

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,402
Which one?

26
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,901
This one.

27
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:26,848
Yeah Right!

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Nice Shot!

29
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:45,561
And this is what she made us
follow her around for?

31
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:49,664
But Tsubaki really gets into anything
that has to do with sports.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,998
Just look at her expression.

34
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,035
Doesn't she seem like a totally different
person from this morning?

35
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,910
Well, I guess it'sbetter
than smacking people

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,714
who annoy her without a care of
what people think of her.

37
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,145
You listen

38
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,211
Okay, keep your eyes glued
to this one!

39
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:10,793
Tsubaki said she's going to sink
a dunk shot today no matter what.

41
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:14,262
Why would someone on the volleyball
team want to sink a dunk shot?

43
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:17,895
Well, it's Tsubaki...
Ooh, so close!

44
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,328
I want to go back to the classroom already.

45
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,530
Argh, next time for sure.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,229
Just give it up.

47
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,101
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

48
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:47,690
At some point I got used
to being made fun of.

50
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:54,828
So?  C'mon, tell us.

51
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:58,398
Once you accept the fact that you're
worthless anyway...

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,072
...it doesn't hurt that much.

53
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:13,000
Moron, moron!

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,186
Give back my sneakers!

56
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,821
Stupid, they're too good for you!

57
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,757
Quit bullying around!!

58
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:30,706
Thank you.

60
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:33,506
You saved me

61
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,837
Don't you let them make you cry either!!
(Text:They both annoy her)

63
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:45,587
She knew judo, karate,
aikido, and boxing...

65
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:47,113
...and countless guys fell
victim to her fists.

66
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:52,884
She terrified every guy in school.

69
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:57,967
That was Sakura Tsubaki.
(Text:But she was nice to girls)

70
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:03,331
After that, she fixated on me
for some reason.

72
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:13,643
What?

73
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:15,409
Just come with me.

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,180
This, and this, and this...

75
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,249
And this, and this, and this...

76
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,719
This'll be all, ma'am.

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,696
That'll be 280 yen.

78
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:30,523
280 yen.

79
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:34,567
What?!

80
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:38,273
What, I can't use a credit card?

81
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:41,468
Ok, here.
(Text:10,000 Yen)

82
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:45,641
This was just for today, okay?
Don't do it any more.

83
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,243
Oh, fine.

84
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:48,579
Here, have half.

85
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:50,119
I don't want anything with all those...

86
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:53,717
...artificial colors and preservatives in it.
*pH buffers, Aspartame, Sodium nitrite, L-Phenyl
compounds, Magnesium phosphate, Malt Extract*

89
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:59,692
I only eat the candy mommy
buys me from Ginza.

90
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,326
And another time...

91
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,529
Pedal.

92
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,600
You can't even ride a bike?! What a loser!!

93
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:11,632
Sh...Shut up,

94
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,270
I just always get a ride in daddy's car.

95
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,074
You'll be fine. I'll support you back here.
(Text:Riding double is dangerous!)

97
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,410
Really?

98
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,714
Yeah, sure.

99
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,623
There was no end to Sakura's abuse of me.

101
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:32,560
Do it.

102
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,887
She made me do her homework,

103
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:37,533
and then hit me.

104
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,334
What the hell? This is wrong!

105
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,770
I don't make stupid mistakes like this!

106
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,373
I always do what you tell me to,

107
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:47,969
so I want you to help me when I need it.

108
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,839
Of course, I wouldn't make
you do it for free. Here.

109
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:54,246
Sure.

110
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,676
Stupid meatball!

111
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,017
Hah, I have Sakura on my side!

112
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:02,357
Okay Sakura, beat them up!

113
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:03,821
S...Sakura!

114
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:05,794
Oh, sorry.

115
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:07,719
It's time for a TV show
I wanted to watch.

116
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:09,829
Ask me when nothing's on TV.

117
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,840
Why do you keep hanging
around me anyway?

118
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,541
Don't tell me you like me.

119
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:23,812
Oh please.

120
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:27,508
Barbarian girls like you aren't my type.

122
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,000
I have this urge to hit you.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,919
You should stop and think why
you get beat up for once.

124
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,387
It was like I was stuck with the plague
...all the way until seventh grade.

126
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:43,429
Damn you Sakura...
(Text:But I can't do anything)

127
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:46,495
Therefore . . . 

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,539
I was overjoyed when I heard we were moving.
*Yahoo!*

129
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,205
I'll finally be free from this
humiliating life!

130
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,867
Farewell, to the old me who was
forced to be who I wasn't!

132
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:01,772
But...
I wanted to find out one last thing.

134
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,588
Sakura, why do you keep pestering me?

135
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:13,388
Oh, the teacher asked me to look
after you back in elementary school.

138
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:17,259
With me around, you wouldn't get beat up that much.

139
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:20,031
And it's rather my policy not to
beat people up.

140
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:24,602
Well, good luck at your new school.

141
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:25,533
Take care.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,533
She was asked, that was all.
She thoght nothing of me.

143
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,551
For the first time in my life,
I realized my pride was deeply hurt.

145
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,658
That to her, I was a
meaningless existence.

146
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,824
But it was obvious, if you think about it.
I was such a failure.

147
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:53,028
I knew I'd only be away for
a short while.

148
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,028
I will change.

149
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:59,565
I will change so much that there'll be no way
she can ignore me the next time we meet.

151
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:02,172
I'm not going to let it end like this.

152
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,586
Tsubaki, let's go back to class!

153
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,987
Not yet. Not until I get this dunk down.

154
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,162
I know I asked you this before,
but aren't you on the volleyball team?

156
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,866
Yes!

157
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,076
Ah?

158
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,534
Bravo!

159
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:52,980
Who was that?

160
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:54,979
He's the one. Tonami Takefumi,
the one from...

161
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,690
Okinawa with the same name
as Tonami-kun.

162
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:07,834
He's nothing like him!!
Hahahahahahahahahaha!!

163
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,604
It is him!

164
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,540
That stupid girl hasn't changed at all!

165
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:20,648
No matter. I have changed.

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,583
I got taller, I got stronger,
I got over my diseases.

167
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,746
And I got thinner.

168
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:29,753
I'm not as I was
when I was under her thumb.

169
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,191
I'll let her pay nice and slowly.

170
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:02,952
Whatcha looking at?

171
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,788
What are you looking at?

172
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:06,353
That was fast!

173
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,295
The results are out already.

174
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,524
Wow, Yukinon and Arima really
live up to their reputations.

175
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:14,665
What's the matter, Tsubaki?

176
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,862
That dunk dude is up there too.

177
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:19,502
You're right. He must be smart.

178
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,646
Not bad.

179
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,448
How did you do?

180
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,418
I'm not smart enough to
be among the top.

181
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:42,898
Aya, Rika, let's go!

182
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:49,263
I guess she grew up enough that
she didn't deck me on the spot.

184
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:51,630
What the hell's his problem?

185
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,342
Shibahime figured it out.

186
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,081
After all, she is a wild animal.

187
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:10,081
What, Arima?! As in, that Arima-kun?!
No way!

189
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,791
Hey, Arima! The grades are out!

190
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,194
Hurry hurry!

191
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:21,191
A...Arima-kun!

192
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,801
I made sure Sakura was here,

193
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:29,640
but I figured Arima-kun would be
at some famous private school!

195
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:34,544
We're in the same high school?!

196
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,353
Arima-kun and I were in the same
class in middle school.

197
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,986
He was my idol.

198
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,860
Look, we tied for first!

199
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:54,495
That's great.
Now there'll be no hard feelings.

200
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey, doesn't this look like
I'm in third place?

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What?

202
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,968
It looks third! And it looks like you're first!
No fair!!

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,038
It's so unfair! Even if we put in the
same effort Arima will always be ahead.

205
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,848
There's no hope with Miyazawa.

206
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,841
Oh, come on now, who cares?

207
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:12,682
Ow, my foot!

208
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:13,483
*Squish*

209
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,889
I can't believe you!

210
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:23,691
Aw, all that's left would be to marry
you and get myself among the A's.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Arima Yokuni
Arima Souichiro

212
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,544
Huh? What's the matter?

213
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,704
Oh, nothing...

214
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,773
One more point and I would've
been first place by myself.

216
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,715
I made a careless mistake.

217
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,278
I made a stroke error on one Kanji.

218
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:48,288
Why do you make such stupid
mistakes when you're so smart?

219
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,595
I...Is that his girlfriend?

220
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:15,379
Arima-kun was different from
the other kids from the very start.

222
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:17,514
You could just tell his good upbringing.

223
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,844
His fairness and gentle disposition.

224
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,000
His capacity as a leader.

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,957
It was like only he was surrounded
in a special atmosphere.

226
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:33,960
Luckily for me, no bullying
happened in his class.

228
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:37,295
Even that violent Sakura...

229
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:39,406
Hey, go buy me some juice!

230
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,602
Don't be mean to someone in my class.

231
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:44,770
Arima!

232
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:51,449
Oh fine.
Later.

233
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,249
She wouldn't lift her hand against Arima.

234
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:57,792
Wow! Arima-kun, you're so cool!

235
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,294
You're really awesome!

236
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,027
And cool! Thanks, Arima-kun!

237
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,464
Arima!

238
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,881
That's Arima-kun, three years later...

239
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,642
Nice shot, Arima!

240
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,523
He's still so cool! He's beautiful!

241
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,319
Why are you blushing at another guy?

242
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,952
Let's go, Tonami!

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Right!

244
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:41,870
Awesome, Tonami!

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,709
Oh, you're the Tonami-kun
who just transferred into 1-B!

246
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:56,779
A...Arima-kun...

247
00:15:57,353 --> 00:15:59,014
Did you used to live around here?

248
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:00,955
I know someone with the same name.

249
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,218
Um, th...that's me.

250
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,954
Really? I knew it!

251
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:06,889
You've changed so much,

252
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,021
I was afraid I had the wrong person.

253
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,096
Yeah, I've changed.

254
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:16,762
It's good to see you again.
Welcome back.

255
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:20,869
He remembered me.

256
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:23,601
There was someone who would welcome me back...

257
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:27,146
When I had come back to this city
only to get back at Sakura.

259
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,943
It made me so happy.

260
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,553
Arima, who are you bringing?!

261
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:44,722
This is Tonami-kun.

262
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:47,226
We were in the same junior high.

263
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:48,867
It's been a while since
we last saw each other.

264
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,129
Is it okay if Tonami eats
lunch with us?

265
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:52,767
Hmm, in that case, okay.

266
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,239
No way!

267
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:57,110
Don't be friends with any guy but me!

269
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,777
Stop suffocating me.

270
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,179
Well, this is Miyazawa-san,
who's in my class...

271
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:03,108
...and on the Student Council with me.

272
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:04,509
Hi.

273
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:06,746
And this is Asaba.

274
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,324
But you can forget his name right away.

275
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:11,583
No way!

276
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,057
And Miyazawa and I are going out.

277
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:18,422
It's none of my business,

278
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:21,767
but Arima sure has strange tastes.

279
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,499
Oh, but I guess she's cute when
she keeps her mouth shut.

280
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,634
Let's have lunch.

281
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,380
Okay Arima, say "aah"

282
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,845
What're you thinking?!

283
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:40,510
No, I don't want any!

284
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:42,553
C'mon, say "aah"!

285
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:43,855
No!

286
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:48,324
Hey, what the?!
Hideaki you moron, let me go!

287
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,192
No!

288
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,314
Violating someone is so fun!

289
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:07,712
It's addictive.

290
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,180
Are you all idiots?

291
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:15,922
You're not eating with
Sakura's gang today?

292
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:18,517
Sakura?

293
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:21,562
Yeah, I want to pay attention
to just you sometimes.

294
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,196
Plus, this week...

295
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,256
What?

296
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,099
Aya-chan wrote this screenplay.

297
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,570
She wants us to perform it
at the Culture Fair...

298
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,528
...with Maho-san and Tsubasa-chan.

299
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,206
You should do it. I'd love to see it.

300
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,512
No way! You're just pulling my leg.

301
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,878
I can't act in front of people!

302
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,474
That's why I'm avoiding her!

303
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:43,609
What?

304
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,085
Are you trying to pit a
play against my dinner show?

306
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:47,613
Shut up!

307
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,480
Your attitude when you talk
about that pisses me off!

308
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:30,890
It looks like Arima...changed a little.

309
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,072
I really am back,

310
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:48,781
I really am back, for the first time in three years.

312
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,261
Sis is still running from Aya-chan in
the days preparing for the Culture Fair.

313
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:56,504
But unrelated to that,

314
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,468
Tonami Takefumi's plans for
revenge against?

315
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,071
...Tsubaki finally becomes clear!

316
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,140
And the weird friendship that develops...

317
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,273
...between him and Sis blows up a storm!

318
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:06,275
See next Act, 14 Days Pt. 3!
