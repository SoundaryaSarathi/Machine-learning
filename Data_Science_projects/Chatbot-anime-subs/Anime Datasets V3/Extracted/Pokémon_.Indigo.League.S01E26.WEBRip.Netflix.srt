<i>Ash and his friends find themselves</i>
<i>in a new city.</i>

14
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,739
Gee, it sort of feels like
all these buildings are closing in on us.

15
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,285
Yeah and they're all so tall,
you can hardly see any sky.

16
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,830
-Where are we, Brock?
-Uh, Hophophop Town?

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,540
[both] Hop, hop, hop?

18
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,959
Chu. Pikachu?

19
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,294
-[woman] Arnold!
-Huh?

20
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,295
Arnold!

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,130
[Ash grunts]

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,591
Where have you been, Arnold?
Mother's been so worried.

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,218
-Huh?
-Pika?

24
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,971
Excuse me, but my name is Ash.

25
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,973
And my name is Misty, ma'am.

26
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,142
She wasn't talking to you, Misty.

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,476
I guess not. Ah!

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,021
Oh! I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,939
But you look just like my Arnold.

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,400
-Huh?
-What happened to him?

31
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,030
[Ash] Hypnos Naptime

32
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,411
I'm so upset
because my son Arnold just disappeared.

33
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,371
He's been gone for three days.

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,082
I can't find him anywhere.

35
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,085
-And you haven't heard from him?
-Not a word.

36
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,796
Could he have gone off
to become a Pokémon trainer?

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,049
He did like Pokémon of course,

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,052
but he never mentioned anything
about becoming a trainer.

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,888
Don't you think
he'll probably just come home soon?

40
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,892
Mm-mm. My son isn't the only child
who's disappeared recently.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,769
-[Brock] He's not?
-[Ash] Huh?

42
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,604
[woman] See those posters?

43
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,730
[Ash] Posters?

44
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,567
Those are pictures of all the children
that have disappeared.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,194
[Misty] That many?

46
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,696
This must be a pretty dangerous town.

47
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,617
My picture's going to be on posters
when I'm a big, famous star.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,868
[both sigh]

49
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,328
-Huh?
-Excuse me.

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,456
-Well, maybe in horror movies.
-Pikachu.

51
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,668
[woman] They certainly were nice children,
all of them.

52
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,337
Disappearing one by one like that?

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,381
I just can't understands it.

54
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,718
Hmm, let's see.
Where should I hang this one?

55
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,011
Excuse me.

56
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,848
Are you the cousin or second cousin
of the Jenny in Maiden's Peak?

57
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,351
Actually, I'm here cousin's cousin.

58
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,019
It figures.

59
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,022
This one's the most beautiful one yet.

60
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,982
They're all exactly alike.

61
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,944
It must be terrible
searching for all these lost children.

62
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,280
I would be very happy
to help you in your search.

63
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,659
-What?
-We can both work together hand in hand.

64
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,578
Hmm. Just don't get in the way.

65
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,663
[Brock chuckles]

66
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,292
[Ash]
Gee, she reminds me of...

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,254
My mom.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,180
-She must be worried.
-Pikachu.

69
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,100
-You think so too, huh?
-Pika.

70
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,312
Well, in that case, Detective Ash Ketchum
will solve this mystery.

71
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,607
-Pika!
-[Misty sighs]

72
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,613
All of the missing children
disappeared exactly three days ago.

73
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,365
Three days ago?

74
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,577
Besides that, do the missing children
have anything else in common?

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
That's a brilliant deduction.

76
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,205
The missing children
must have something in common.

77
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,751
-They don't have a thing in common.
-Hmm.

78
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,837
But I think other kids may know
something about it.

79
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,425
[Brock] I see. So we'll ask the kids
in the Pokémon Center

80
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,634
if they know anything.

81
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,387
That's it, Brock. Brilliant deduction.

82
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,852
-Have you seen this little boy before?
-I haven't.

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,229
Yeah, I play with them all the time.

84
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,274
-When was the last time you saw him?
-I don't know.

85
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,985
You two had better answer
all these questions truthfully.

86
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,154
-Okay.
-Now, tell this beautiful young lady

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,280
everything you know.

88
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,698
[whimpers]

89
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,743
You do think she's beautiful, don't you?
Come on, what do you say?

90
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,661
Now you're getting in the way.

91
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,958
Ah, I bet you're related to the Joy
from Maiden's Peak, aren't you?

92
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,919
Well, you'd win that bet.

93
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,379
We're here about the missing children.

94
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,715
Oh, those kids who disappeared
all of a sudden.

95
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,342
I saw it on the news.

96
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,345
Please, is there anything you can tell us
about these children?

97
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,305
I'd like to help you, but right now,

98
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,433
I'm afraid I've got my hands full
with our own mystery.

99
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,352
[Misty] What do you mean?
What's the matter?

100
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,272
All the Pokémon here at the center
are behaving very strangely.

101
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,233
[both] Huh?

102
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:22,155
Just look at Cubone... and Oddish.

103
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:27,410
Even Magikarp is affected
and it's usually full of life.

104
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,329
The magic's disappeared.

105
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,373
Looks like it's ready
for the deli counter.

106
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,293
The flame on this Charmander
could go out any minute.

107
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,255
Oh.

108
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,758
And this one's
been in just terrible shape.

109
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,885
-Psy-yi-yi.
-What is it?

110
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,555
[Pokédex] <i>Psyduck, a water Pokémon.</i>

111
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,016
<i>Uses mysterious power</i>
<i>to perform various attacks.</i>

112
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,228
-Mysterious powers?
-That's hard to believe.

113
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,148
-So, what's causing all this?
-I have no idea.

114
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,942
How long have they been acting like this?

115
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,529
-Since three days ago.
-Three days ago?

116
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,700
And that's exactly when all those children
disappeared, isn't it?

117
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,786
I wonder if maybe
there's some kind of connection

118
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,999
between the children's disappearance
and the Pokémon's lack of energy.

119
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,751
Hm, one mystery leads to another.

120
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,880
One more puzzle for the mind
of Ash Ketchum, master detective.

121
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,090
Hm...

122
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,718
-Did you think of anything yet?
-Not a thing.

123
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,885
[all sigh]

124
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,888
Something's very strange.
[buzzing]

125
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,848
Huh?

126
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,767
-Is that your radio?
-Hm-mm.

127
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,603
[buzzing]

128
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,771
It's picking up something.

129
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,859
I bet I know what that is.
A handsome guy detector.

130
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,069
Don't kid yourself. [grunts]

131
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,948
-This is a sleep wave detector.
-A sleep wave detector?

132
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,117
Lately, I've been picking up sleep waves.

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,786
-What are they?
-Wavelengths that induce sleep.

134
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,874
But I'm sure there aren't any Pokémon
that emit that wavelength in this center.

135
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,417
They're from outside.

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,503
Pikachu.

137
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,798
Oh, no.
Look, even Pikachu's losing energy.

138
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,719
I wonder if those sleep waves
and the Pokémons' condition are--

139
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,221
Yeah, they may be connected.

140
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,766
Hey, Pikachu, wake up, pal.

141
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,934
[groans]

142
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,145
I think we'd better find the source
of these sleep waves.

143
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,605
[all] Mm-hm.

144
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,398
[bleeping]

145
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,735
I knew it.
The sleep waves are coming from this town.

146
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,362
Now we can get our wish.

147
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,614
We'll find the source of the waves.

148
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,824
And we'll use them to knock out the boss.

149
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,161
Then while he's fast asleep,
we can take a break.

150
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,748
While the boss is conked out,
I'll take a fishing expedition.

151
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,707
[all sobbing]

152
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,377
[Jessie] We've all been working
so hard at being bad.

153
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,212
[James] Even if we always fail.

154
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,465
Maybe we're not so good,
but we need a vacation bad.

155
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,468
[all wailing]

156
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,929
[buzzing]

157
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,934
[gasps]

158
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,477
They're coming from this building.

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,313
[Ash] Whoa, it's so tall.

160
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,775
-They seem to be coming from the roof.
-Let's go.

161
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,488
As we go up,
the signal's getting stronger.

162
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,448
[dinging]

163
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,283
[buzzing faster]

164
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,089
[Ash] Wha... What's that?

165
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,259
[Brock]
A mansion on top of the skyscraper?

166
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,640
-It's coming from inside there.
-All right.

167
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,100
Wait, Ash.

168
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,031
-What now?
-There's someone inside.

169
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,574
I'm going in.

170
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,325
[both] Ready, set...

171
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,494
[grunting]

172
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,455
Unh. Huh?

173
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,040
-Huh?
-Oh.

174
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,000
[both] Huh? Huh?

175
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,675
-What is this place?
-What's going on here?

176
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,473
Are you new members?

177
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,266
Uh, members?

178
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,684
-Uh...
-We've been monitoring

179
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,936
some sleep waves coming from up here.

180
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,398
Sleep waves? Oh, I know.

181
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,195
-This Hypno must have been emitting them.
-Hypno?

182
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,198
[Pokédex]
<i>Hypno, a hypnosis Pokémon.</i>

183
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:38,703
<i>It carries a pendulum-like device</i>
<i>and performs hypnotic attacks.</i>

184
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,996
[Ash] Huh.

185
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,791
[Misty] And what's that next to it?

186
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>Drowzee, said to be a descendent</i>
<i>of the dream-eating tapir.</i>

187
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,757
<i>It was the first Pokémon</i>
<i>to use a combination attack</i>

188
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,717
<i>like hypnosis and dream eater.</i>

189
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,679
I think a Hypno is the evolved form
of a Drowzee, isn't it?

190
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,014
Yes, that's correct.

191
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,683
And our Drowzee finally evolved
into a Hypno.

192
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,644
Three days ago.

193
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,063
-Three days ago?
-I knew it.

194
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,940
That's just when those children vanished

195
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,525
and the Pokémon started to lose

196
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,360
-all their energy.
-[all] Mm-hm.

197
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,322
We've been using the Pokémon
instead of using sleeping medicine.

198
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,698
What do you mean we?

199
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,076
The members of the Pokémon Lover's Club.

200
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,621
-The Pokémon Lover's Club?
-Precisely.

201
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,749
You see, all of our members
absolutely adore Pokémon,

202
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,461
and well, Hypno has become
our favorite Pokémon.

203
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,298
Everyone's hard work paid off
when Drowzee finally evolved.

204
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,633
Oh?

205
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,886
Living our lives in the city
can be very stressful

206
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,139
and all the members suffer from insomnia,

207
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:43,017
so we've come to rely on Hypno's powers
to help us get to sleep at night.

208
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,813
Hypno. Hypno. Hypno.

209
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,570
Hypno's sleep waves
must have affected all those Pokémon

210
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,196
by zapping their energy.

211
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,906
[gasps]

212
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,784
Take a look at my Pikachu.

213
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,744
Pika.

214
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,248
The same thing happened to all
of the Pokémon at the Pokémon Center.

215
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,499
It must be a--

216
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,335
-A side effect?
-Side effect?

217
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,797
Mm, Hypno's hypnotic powers
are usually just used

218
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,965
only on other Pokémon.

219
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,801
Since the wavelength was changed
to affect humans,

220
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,928
it's creating a side effect
for the Pokémon.

221
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,556
-Yeah.
-Hm.

222
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,893
Somehow, we've accidentally caused
a terrible situation.

223
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,353
[Brock] You know what?
I'll bet that new wavelength

224
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,899
can even affect some kids
that are sensitive to it too.

225
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,984
-[Ash] Kids?
-Yeah.

226
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,653
[Pikachu mumbles]

227
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,739
Let's see.

228
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:43,703
Hypno. Hypno. Hypno.

229
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,123
Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel.

230
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,167
Misty, what's the matter?

231
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,920
Misty's being controlled
by the sleep wave.

232
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,130
We've gotta do something. Aah!

233
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,965
Aah! Hey, Misty!

234
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,927
Where are you going?
Misty, come back! Ugh!

235
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,765
[clapping]

236
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,434
Seel, Seel, Seel.

237
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,395
I can't believe there's a park this big
in the middle of the city.

238
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,315
Seel, Seel, Seel.

239
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,485
[panting]

240
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,278
[all gasp]

241
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,406
Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel.

242
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,283
[girl chittering]

243
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,743
Coo, coo.

244
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,579
Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur.

245
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,706
These are all the missing children.

246
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,458
Whee!

247
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,920
[chittering]

248
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,299
Gloom, Gloom, Gloom. Gloom.

249
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,010
What's happening?
Why are they acting that way?

250
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,972
-Pokémonitis.
-Pokémonitis?

251
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,306
With that new wavelength,

252
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,017
the children who were exposed
to Hypno's sleep waves

253
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,519
think that they're Pokémon now.

254
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,980
-And it got Misty too?
-Yeah.

255
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,440
Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel.

256
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,402
How on earth could a thing like this
have happened?

257
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,946
Magikarp, Magikarp, Magikarp.

258
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,077
-Bulbasaur!
-Magikarp, Magikarp, Magikarp.

259
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,038
All right, wake up, everyone.
It's time to go home.

260
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,542
Come on. Stop this.
Wake up now, kids.

261
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,128
All of your mothers are worried sick.

262
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,005
Ugh! Magikarp, Magikarp.

263
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,091
-It's just no use.
-What can we do?

264
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,217
Hmm.

265
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,094
Say, I know.

266
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,430
What if we use Drowzee
to cure the children?

267
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,639
Drowzee?

268
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,600
Sleep emits dream wavelengths,

269
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,854
which, in this case, may counteract
Hypno's wavelengths.

270
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,856
Hmm, yeah, that might just work.

271
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,315
Let's give it a try.

272
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,782
Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel.

273
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:49,037
Drowzee, emit your dream waves
and focus them toward this girl.

274
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,167
Drowzee. Drowzee. Drowzee.

275
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,173
-Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel. Seel, Seel.
-Drowzee. Drowzee. Drowzee.

276
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,634
-Whoa, Misty.
-She must be in a pretty deep trance.

277
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,600
Drowzee. Drowzee. Drowzee.

278
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,809
Drowzee!

279
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,771
Huh? Hey, where am I?

280
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,023
Gee, Misty, you're looking kind of beat.

281
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,026
When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

282
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,236
-She's back to normal.
-Huh?

283
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,199
Now we've got use Drowzee's sleep waves
on all those kids in the park.

284
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,911
Okay, now we've gotta get those kids
back to normal.

285
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,417
You mean I thought I was a Pokémon?

286
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,128
Yeah, you turned completely into a Seel.

287
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,636
-What's what?
-Whatever it is, it's coming this way.

288
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,054
Oh, no. Not them.

289
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,349
[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.

290
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,518
[James] Make it double.

291
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,354
To protect the world from devastation.

292
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,315
To unite all peoples within our nation.

293
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,276
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

294
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,987
To extend our reach to the stars above.

295
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,366
-Ha, Jessie.
-James.

296
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,036
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

297
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,497
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

298
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,332
Meowth. That's flight.

299
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,628
Now to swoop down
and swipe those hypnosis Pokémon.

300
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,671
[all] Ah!

301
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,382
[grunting]

302
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
Nice three-point landing.

303
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,554
Team Rocket is here to take possession
of Drowzee and Hypno.

304
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,888
You're dreaming.

305
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,183
Well, we'll just have to see
who's dreaming after this.

306
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:39,522
If Hypno can put anything to sleep,
try this.

307
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,774
Now, wait.

308
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,862
If you have any pride
as a hypnosis Pokémon, you'll do it.

309
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,738
This is known as the Team Rocket

310
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,742
"mirror, mirror on the wall
who's the sleepiest of them all"

311
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,619
dirty trick strategy.

312
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,330
Just don't hypnotize me.
Okay, do it.

313
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,919
Hypno. Hypno. Hypno.

314
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,801
-You've got to do something, Ash.
-There's not much time.

315
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,012
[Ash grunts]

316
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,516
-Huh?
-[grunts]

317
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,811
And we thought so hard
to come up with that strategy.

318
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,730
-Hyah!
-Ha!

319
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,693
We got 'em!

320
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,030
-Now we'll just fly away with our catch.
-I don't get it.

321
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,324
Why didn't we do this from the beginning?

322
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,659
We have to fill a half hour.

323
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,578
[grunts]

324
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
Hang on, Ash.

325
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,165
Go, Staryu!

326
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,249
[grunts]

327
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,213
[both scream]

328
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,385
Pidgeotto, go!

329
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,553
Pidgeo!

330
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,764
Okay, Pidgeotto, powerful gust.

331
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,599
[shrieks]

332
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,185
[all screaming]

333
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,811
Give them your best blast.

334
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,772
Pidgeo!

335
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,942
[all screaming]

336
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,447
I suppose this means
that we blew it again.

337
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,825
We blew it again. We blew it sky-high.

338
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,494
And what goes up must always come down.

339
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,707
[all] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again!

340
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,169
-Come on, guys. Let's go.
-Right.

341
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,882
Drowzee. Drowzee.

342
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,805
[Brock]
They're all dreaming.

343
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,976
Pikachu too.

344
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,186
Drowzee.

345
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,194
Hey, how did I get
into the middle of the park?

346
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,489
Me too. And I should be working
on becoming a Pokémon trainer.

347
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,241
I want to be a fireman.

348
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,326
And I'm going to be a doctor.

349
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,787
-[boy] Let's go home.
-[girl] See you later.

350
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,664
-Pika.
-Huh?

351
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,748
Whoa!

352
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,458
[sputtering]
[Ash chuckles]

353
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,793
Pikachu.

354
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,171
Pikachu! It sounds like you're back
to your old self.

355
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,256
-[woman] Arnold!
-Huh?

356
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,382
[panting]

357
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,092
It's that mother we met.

358
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,553
Mommy.

359
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,888
-That's great.
-Yeah.

360
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,684
Ash, we've gotta cure the Pokémon
at the Pokémon Center too.

361
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,852
Right.

362
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,649
Drowzee. Drowzee.

363
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,068
-Cubone, bone.
-Oddish, Oddish.

364
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,529
Charmander!

365
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,531
Magikarp, karp, karp. Magi.

366
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,242
Heh. The Pokémon are all back to normal.

367
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,829
Sometimes I wonder
what the Pokémon dream about.

368
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,748
I'd love to know that too.

369
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,209
They must have been dreaming
of getting stronger and evolving.

370
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,671
I dream about that sometimes too.
[giggles]

371
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:55,635
Well, that's just one more case
solved by Ash Ketchum, master detective.

372
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,970
Excuse me, but you didn't solve anything.

373
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,180
Are you joking?

374
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,432
[laughs]

375
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,391
Pika.

376
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,018
[sighs]

377
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,102
What's the matter?

378
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,356
A beautiful woman shouldn't have
too much to be sad about.

379
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,943
All of the Pokémon are better,
but this one's still holding its head.

380
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,028
Leave it to me.

381
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,407
Caring for Pokémon is the sole purpose
of my life, the reason I exist.

382
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,451
Then maybe you can help it.

383
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,747
-Oh.
-Psyduck. Psy.

384
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,833
Well, you were the one who said,
"Leave it to me," Brock.

385
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,962
But Psyduck is a water Pokémon.
You better take it, Misty.

386
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,548
Why would I want
such a boring Pokémon?

387
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,469
[Pokédex] <i>Psyduck,</i>
<i>constantly suffers from a headache.</i>

388
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,097
You mean this thing always has a headache?

389
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,140
[screams]

390
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,809
My Poké Ball.

391
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,731
Psy? Duck?

392
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,899
Psy!

393
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,319
Oh, no. Now it's in my Poké Ball?

394
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,988
Good work, Misty. You captured Psyduck.

395
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,658
Oh, now I've got the headache.

396
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,994
[narrator] <i>And so Misty effortlessly</i>
<i>captures Psyduck</i>

397
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,288
<i>and the mysteries were all solved.</i>

398
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>-Congratulations.</i>
-Don't congratulate me!

399
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,257
