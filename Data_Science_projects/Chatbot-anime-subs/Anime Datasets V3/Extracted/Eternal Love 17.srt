<i>[Episode 17]</i>

3
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:24,413
Dijun, what do you have in your arms?

4
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:28,503
You can't tell from looking
what this is?

5
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:32,894
I've just never seen Dijun have any
relations with a woman. I'm shocked.

6
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,044
Isn't that Qing Qiu's little princess?

7
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:38,024
She's a nice girl. A nice girl.

8
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,174
But you shouldn't mess with Qing Qiu.

9
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:43,984
Dijun, my second brother and Ye Hua
both fell into their hands.

10
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,503
You have to think about this carefully.

11
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:48,984
It's not easy being a
son-in-law of the Fox Clan.

12
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:59,213
Did she get tricked
into eating a drunken fruit?

13
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,343
Go ask your woman about it.

14
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:18,723
- Dijun.
- Dijun.

15
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,473
Where does Feng Jiu sleep?

16
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,764
That bed.

17
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:51,014
Dong Hua... Dong Hua.

18
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,663
Dijun.

19
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:24,774
Did you carry me back
to the palace yesterday?

20
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,403
That's right.

21
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:33,084
Then... were you the one who fed
me two bowls of sobering soup?

22
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,283
No, it was three bowls.

23
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,793
Is there anything else you want to ask?

24
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,574
If there's nothing else,
then I have to head to court.

25
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:48,024
Then... how should we account
for the sobering soup?

26
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:56,014
I don't mind if you add it to
the debt of having saved your life.

27
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,293
What?

28
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,473
What? You don't want to pay that debt?

29
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:04,004
- No, that's not it.
- That's fine too.

30
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:08,814
A couple bowls of sobering soup
are not a big deal.

31
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:11,963
No, I have to pay back
the debt of sobering soup too.

32
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:14,504
I can't break Qing Qiu's rules.

33
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:17,603
I can't embarrass Aunt.

34
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:23,043
Seems like your aunt
taught you quite well.

35
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:25,293
My aunt has always taught me
by words and example.

36
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:28,694
Even my mom and dad say I'm most
like my aunt when she was young.

37
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,363
Oh?

38
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:35,363
You're most like your aunt?

39
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,624
When your aunt was young,
she was a disciple at Kunlun Mountain.

40
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,704
She was more overbearing than you.

41
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,824
With one wave of the
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun

42
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:45,704
she got rid of 18 immortals.

43
00:05:48,204 --> 00:05:53,483
How come I've never heard
Aunt talk about that?

44
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:07,324
While you were at the Celestial Palace,
has Si Ming told you about

45
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:10,244
what kind of person Dong Hua Dijun is?

46
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,454
He keeps away from worldly affairs

47
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,774
even major events that deal
with the peace of all the realms.

48
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,033
He doesn't respect others,
and doesn't go to banquets.

49
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,723
He's the kind of immortal you
would hang a portrait of on your wall.

50
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,603
So you don't have to worry
about me knowing about this.

51
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:30,483
I'm an immortal who
doesn't gossip with others.

52
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:37,084
Really? You really won't tell
others that my Aunt is Si Yin?

53
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,894
I won't.

54
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,033
This is Qing Qiu's biggest secret.

55
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,134
I just accidentally overheard it.

56
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,423
Even Mo Yuan's...

57
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,303
Come to think of it

58
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:54,374
Lord of Numinous Treasures and I
have a special fate with your aunt.

59
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,704
After your aunt marries and
comes to the Celestial Palace

60
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:59,363
I will talk to her about this.

61
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:04,363
Didn't you promise me
you wouldn't tell outsiders about this?

62
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,944
Does your aunt count as an outsider?

63
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:11,303
No.

64
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,634
Then I'll head over to court.

65
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,653
Okay.

66
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,723
You're back. Hurry and add some firewood.

67
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,283
What's wrong?
Did smoke get in your eyes?

68
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,783
Come here.

69
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:17,363
Let me see.

70
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:25,074
Do you know that you've been gone
for one year and nine months?

71
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,173
I know.

72
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:34,744
Aren't you scared that
I'll be old when you come back?

73
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:42,744
I am. That's why I'm making plans for us
to stay together for a long, long time.

74
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:47,494
Is it because your family
doesn't like me?

75
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:52,673
Or is it because you
already have a wife?

76
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:59,073
Before marrying you,
I've never been married before.

77
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:00,344
Don't cry.

78
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:06,464
I kept thinking about what I should do
if you already had a wife.

79
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:13,124
All right. Everything's okay now.

80
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:27,774
Why did you make such a complicated dish?

81
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:30,754
Why not? Should I make
you eat raw meat every day?

82
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,364
What's with your face of disgust?

83
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,813
It's like someone has forced you
to eat raw meat before.

84
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:40,303
Someone has.

85
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:44,433
Really? Who was so tactless and
forced you to eat raw meat?

86
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,453
All right, get ready to eat.

87
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,303
Okay.

88
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,764
Eat while it's hot.

89
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,173
I have to go far away again.

90
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,073
You have to leave again?

91
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:23,283
I have to leave tomorrow morning.

92
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,644
How long will you be gone for this time?

93
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:33,703
One year? Two years? Or ten years?

94
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:35,563
Su Su.

95
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:40,163
Take me with you this time.

96
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,974
No.

97
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,364
Why not?

98
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:47,874
It's dangerous. I can't take you with me.

99
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:54,244
I'm not scared of danger,
no matter how bad it is.

100
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:57,634
I'm scared of not being with you.

101
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:05,153
I never know where you are.

102
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,844
I never know when you'll be back.

103
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:11,063
I really don't want
to continue like this.

104
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:18,533
Ye Hua, what do you take me for?

105
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,124
Do you think of me as your wife?

106
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:24,083
If so, then we should be interdependent
and go through everything together.

107
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,293
Su Su, you don't understand.

108
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,803
I don't want you to be in any danger.

109
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:37,283
You don't understand either.

110
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:43,283
I'd rather be with you and in danger.

111
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:51,053
Pack up tonight.
We'll head out tomorrow morning.

112
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:57,844
- Really?
- What? You want to back out now?

113
00:11:57,844 --> 00:12:00,134
Why would I back out?

114
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:01,714
Where are you taking me?

115
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,063
You'll know when we get there.

116
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:05,423
Okay.

117
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,344
Let's eat.

118
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:18,884
I'm going far away.
I can't feed you anymore.

119
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:22,614
If fate allows,
let's meet again in the future.

120
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,484
Su Su.

121
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,573
This is a fan for you.

122
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,264
Fan?

123
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:50,203
What? Is something wrong with it?

124
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:54,244
This fan is really similar
to the one I gave away.

125
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:57,153
Even the painting on it is similar.

126
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:01,693
The priest told me that the
painting was of Kunlun Mountain.

127
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:06,053
Most fans look the same. There are only
a limited number of mountains to paint.

128
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,073
That's true.

129
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,693
But it looks too similar.

130
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,744
Su Su, hide behind the trees.

131
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:47,004
What's wrong?

132
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:51,244
Those guys look pretty good.

133
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:53,153
Yes, let's catch them and
offer them to our leader.

134
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,533
Let's go!

135
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,644
Hide!

136
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:57,053
<i>Master?</i>

137
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,004
Ye Hua.

138
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,604
Are you okay?

139
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:06,943
I'm fine. What about you?

140
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,083
<i>Seventeenth?</i>

141
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:15,884
<i>No, she's clearly a woman</i>

142
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,724
<i>and a mortal with no magic breath.</i>

143
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:20,614
<i>How could I have mistaken her?</i>

144
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:24,484
<i>But if she's not Seventeenth,
why does she have Master's fan?</i>

145
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,274
<i>And this man...</i>

146
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:31,043
<i>Although he looks very similar to Master,
he doesn't have Master's magic breath.</i>

147
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,043
<i>Who exactly is he?</i>

148
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,854
<i>Who exactly are these two people?</i>

149
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:41,144
Where are you from?

150
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,474
Wait here for me.

151
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,033
May I speak to you somewhere else?

152
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,644
Okay.

153
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:56,923
Are you Water King of West Sea's
second son Die Feng?

154
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:59,533
I am. And you are?

155
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,774
I am Crown Prince Ye Hua.

156
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,783
Your High--

157
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,814
I came undercover to Chang Sea
on Heavenly Lord's orders.

158
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:08,483
I don't want anyone else
to know my identity.

159
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,753
Including that person.

160
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:13,023
I understand.

161
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,574
What is Your Highness here
at Chang Sea for?

162
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:16,834
The mermaid clan.

163
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,584
So it was because of the mermaid clan.

164
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,624
I knew the Celestial Palace
would make a move soon.

165
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,763
How did Your Highness know my identity?

166
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,864
I heard from a general of
one of the clans

167
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,064
that for the past thousands of years

168
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:33,604
you've been helping the Water King of
Chang Sea to ward off the mermaid clan.

169
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:36,443
Furthermore, from your expression
when you saw me

170
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:40,253
I could tell you mistook me
for your master, Mo Yuan.

171
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,713
You are very meticulous in your
observation. I am impressed.

172
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:49,733
Does Your Highness know where that
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun came from?

173
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:53,213
It was in the mortal world and then
ended up in Li Jing's hands.

174
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:56,443
Since it was a magic artifact of
Kunlun Mountain, I asked him for it.

175
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,054
Li Jing?

176
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:02,624
Your Highness, please come with me to
Chang Sea and tell me in detail.

177
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,213
Don't call me "Your Highness."

178
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:08,173
You can call me Hua Ye instead.

179
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,983
This is the Crystal Palace of Chang Sea.

180
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:19,463
After entering here,
you will have left the mortal world

181
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,544
and entered into the immortal world.

182
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:33,733
Ye Hua, what were you two talking
so seriously about just now?

183
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:38,683
I was asking him if he could not expose
the fact this this fan was a counterfeit

184
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:42,423
so that I won't be
embarrassed before my wife.

185
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,023
Yeah, right. I don't believe you.

186
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,044
You two talked for that long about this?

187
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,933
What do you think we were talking about?

188
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:54,544
Look at him. He's dressed like that,
which must mean he's very important.

189
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:59,604
After seeing how amazing you were,
is he trying to recruit you as a general?

190
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,574
You should read less plays.

191
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:04,933
Did I guess wrong?

192
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:09,084
I'm a mortal. How could an immortal
regard me so highly?

193
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,973
He's an immortal?

194
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,263
Sir, do you know that
one day in the immortal world

195
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:17,443
is one year in the mortal world?

196
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,624
Once you enter into the sea,
every day that goes by

197
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,703
is one whole year, with all the seasons.

198
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,963
I read about that in a play.

199
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,604
A few months for you guys
is a lifetime for us.

200
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,114
So what if we live for a long time?

201
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,433
I've been spending the past
70,000 years looking for someone

202
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,534
but haven't made any progress at all.

203
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,864
Isn't that like living in vain?

204
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,483
Are you looking for a relative?

205
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:45,134
Not a relative, but someone
more important than a relative.

206
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,693
Let's go.

207
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:17,814
Big Brother.

208
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:22,423
Yan Zhi.

209
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:26,094
Big Brother, I've made
all the arrangements.

210
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,334
I'll send you to a secret place

211
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:30,753
where Second Brother absolutely
won't be able to find you.

212
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:35,933
Why do I have to flee from him?

213
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,304
Second Brother has already
been Ghost Lord for 70,000 years.

214
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,624
His position is stable.

215
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:43,773
And Father's trusted
confidants are all gone.

216
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:47,693
Big Brother, just find
a place to settle down.

217
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,784
All the jewels I've
collected through the years

218
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,604
should be enough for you
to live a luxurious life.

219
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,933
Go away!

220
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:57,374
Big Brother, you...

221
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,854
Yan Zhi!

222
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:04,084
Come here, Yan Zhi.

223
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,183
Are you okay?

224
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:10,443
It's my fault.

225
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:14,834
What I've been through in prison
for the past 70,000 years...

226
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,653
you can't even imagine it.

227
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:19,604
Since I just came out,
my mood is all over the place.

228
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:20,733
I lost control.

229
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,384
I understand.

230
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:31,243
Yan Zhi, it's good that you understand.

231
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:36,304
Yan Zhi, I absolutely won't let Li Jing
get away with this.

232
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:37,314
Big Brother!

233
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,894
All right. I won't say anything else
you wouldn't want to hear.

234
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:45,163
Your Highnesses,
I've made all the arrangements.

235
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:48,003
We can go to Chang Sea now.

236
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:50,294
Chang Sea?

237
00:21:54,663 --> 00:22:00,223
That's right. My mother was from
the mermaid clan of Chang Sea.

238
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:05,104
For now, it seems they are
the only ones I can rely on.

239
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:07,403
- But Big Brother...
- Yan Zhi.

240
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:15,054
I just want to find a
safe place I can live.

241
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,423
You should know very well

242
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:21,094
that Li Jing and I hate each other
because of our mothers' deaths.

243
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:25,144
He'll eventually find out
that I've escaped.

244
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,933
At that time, he'll definitely
send men to come kill me.

245
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:35,874
For now, it seems like only my
mother's clan can protect me, right?

246
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:40,503
You and Second Brother
are both equally important to me.

247
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:45,933
I really don't want
to see you two fighting to the death.

248
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:48,933
Big Brother, do you understand?

249
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:54,804
I do. I understand.

250
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,693
Scarlet Flame Golden Lion!

251
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,153
Your Highness.

252
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,923
They've been my
trusted confidants for years!

253
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:10,773
Why did you kill them?

254
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:14,173
Your Highness, our journey is top secret.

255
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,943
If any of them leaks news of our journey

256
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:19,304
maybe you wouldn't be killed

257
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:23,094
but His Highness and I
would die and not be buried.

258
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:25,634
They all grew up with me.

259
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:27,923
They wouldn't betray me!

260
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:34,673
Yan Zhi, there are no trusted
confidants in the world.

261
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:40,703
In the past, I was betrayed
by so-called trusted confidants

262
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,183
and lost my position as Ghost Lord

263
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:45,523
and locked in prison for 70,000 years!

264
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:51,324
All right.
I won't talk about this anymore.

265
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:53,134
Let's go.

266
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:14,854
Ye Hua, are we inside
the Crystal Palace now?

267
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:15,903
That's right.

268
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:18,253
Why are you so calm?

269
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:19,503
How should I be?

270
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,534
Oh right, you're like an immortal.

271
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,443
You must have seen this place
in a dream before.

272
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,663
Yes, I've seen it before.

273
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:32,644
- Uncle!
- It must have been hard on you.

274
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,384
I'm sorry for always making you
come here for Chang Sea affairs.

275
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:36,933
Uncle, you don't have to apologize.

276
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,703
The four seas are one clan.

277
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:42,364
Oh yeah, these are two of my friends.

278
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:45,364
I brought them into Chang Sea
without asking for permission first.

279
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,743
I hope you'll forgive me.

280
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:48,864
It's okay. It's okay.

281
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:52,564
If they're your friends,
then they're my honored guests.

282
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:56,034
Come on inside!

283
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,344
Su Su, I need to discuss
some things with Die Feng.

284
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,253
If you're tired, you can just sleep here.

285
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,753
If you want to walk around,
remember to bring the copper mirror.

286
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,374
Why do I have to bring
the copper mirror?

287
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:21,903
I'm afraid you'll get lost.

288
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,243
Okay.

289
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,723
Princess, don't be sad.

290
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,933
This leaf fan is a treasure
that Water King gave you.

291
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,624
It's covered in tears.

292
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:56,814
Aren't you ruining a precious item?

293
00:25:56,814 --> 00:25:59,104
Besides, Water King only said

294
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:01,824
he would marry one princess
to the Mermaid King.

295
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,794
It might not be you.

296
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:06,703
There's also First Princess.

297
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:08,804
First Princess is the most scheming.

298
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:10,584
I can't beat her.

299
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:15,453
She might even be talking to
Father now about marrying me off.

300
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:19,284
The mermaid king looks very sinister.

301
00:26:19,284 --> 00:26:21,773
If I really marry him...

302
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:25,574
Then why don't you listen to Water God
and marry First Prince of West Sea?

303
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:29,733
But First Prince is sickly.

304
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:34,644
Then what about Second Prince?

305
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:41,064
Second Prince is pretty good.

306
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:44,933
He used to be Mo Yuan's
senior disciple too. But...

307
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,884
Your Highness, you still want to
marry into the Celestial Palace?

308
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:51,223
You've never even met
that crown prince before.

309
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:55,183
How can you be so infatuated?

310
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:57,723
Crown Prince's reputation
has spread far and wide.

311
00:26:57,723 --> 00:26:59,544
In the four seas and eight realms

312
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:03,233
he's the only spiritual master
of both Buddhism and Taoism.

313
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:08,534
He's also the last disciple of the
Realm of Supreme Purity's Lord Yuan Shi.

314
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:11,503
Yes. I heard that when he was born

315
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:14,513
the 36 skies radiated
golden rays in an instant.

316
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:18,144
The 72 rainbow birds of the
Mount Junji of the Far East

317
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,384
soared into the sky and circled the
Celestial Palace for 81 days.

318
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:24,923
I can already recite all this.

319
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:27,304
Who is there?

320
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:39,943
What?
Was what you overhead that amusing?

321
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,554
What that princess said
was really amusing.

322
00:27:43,554 --> 00:27:45,973
Sit down. I'll tell you.

323
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:50,544
She doesn't want to marry Mermaid King.

324
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,564
So she thought she might as well
marry Second Prince Die Feng.

325
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:56,903
But she can't bear to part with
the celestial crown prince.

326
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,923
Don't you think it's amusing?

327
00:27:58,923 --> 00:28:02,183
The problem is all three of them
aren't interested in her.

328
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,854
Is that so?

329
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:10,683
When she was talking about the
crown prince, she just went on and on.

330
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,534
Is the celestial
crown prince that famous?

331
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,663
There's only one celestial
crown prince in the world.

332
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,594
How could he not be famous?

333
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:22,334
That's true.

334
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,173
The Princess of Chang Sea
is still a princess.

335
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:29,203
She's never even met him before,
but she pines for him.

336
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:34,094
That means the celestial crown prince
must be very charming.

337
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:38,023
What? Are you also interested in him?

338
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:42,804
Are you jealous?

339
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:48,733
No. It's just that when compared
to the crown prince, I have nothing.

340
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:50,784
I'm making things hard for you.

341
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:56,604
I already told you that I don't mind.

342
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:59,334
Thank you for not minding.

343
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,513
This place is great.

344
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:10,104
It's too bad there's only
the smell of seawater here.

345
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:12,413
There's no smell of flowers.

346
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,523
I really want to smell peach blossoms.

347
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:20,723
I know of a place.

348
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:23,703
There, peach blossoms
bloom all year long.

349
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:27,403
Where is it?

350
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:30,624
Close your eyes. I'll take you there.

351
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,534
You can open your eyes now.

352
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:47,173
Is this a fantasy?

353
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:48,753
No.

354
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:51,903
Then where is this place?

355
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,564
Qing Qiu, Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods.

356
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:56,814
Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods?

357
00:29:56,814 --> 00:29:58,304
There are ten miles of this?

358
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:00,364
That's right.

359
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:04,723
There was someone who spent a long time
to plant these woods.

360
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:07,324
He didn't have much else to do anyway.

361
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:11,644
All day long, he just takes care of peach
blossoms and ferments peach blossom wine.

362
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,394
What a life to live.

363
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,544
Are you envious?

364
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:23,554
Huh? What's there to be envious of?

365
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:27,013
We spend our days
like this at Mount Junji.

366
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:28,584
Every day, there's not much to do.

367
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:33,453
We just go hunting, cook,
and raise pets, right?

368
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:41,624
That's right.
We don't have to be envious of others.

369
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:44,814
Are you friends
with the person who works here?

370
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:46,844
We've met a couple of times.

371
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:50,054
Oh. Is he here?

372
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:54,064
It doesn't seem like it.
I don't sense his magic breath.

373
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:57,294
But it's because he isn't here
that I brought you here.

374
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,653
Is your relationship bad?

375
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,963
No. I admire him.

376
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,864
There are just reasons for why it'd
be inconvenient to see him now.

377
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,443
Oh.

378
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,064
This peach blossom wine is really good.

379
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,874
It seems as if I've had it before.

380
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,624
I didn't expect you to have
such good alcohol tolerance.

381
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,304
I didn't expect it either.

382
00:31:55,304 --> 00:32:01,384
But Ye Hua, can we just take one
of his pitchers of wine like this?

383
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:06,733
It's okay. I don't think I'll ever
see him again in the future.

384
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:10,253
You won't come here
to see your friends anymore?

385
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:11,874
I won't.

386
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:20,534
Then I won't be able to see this
Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods anymore.

387
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:26,423
In the future, I'll plant one for you.

388
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,253
I want it to be ten miles too.

389
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:37,213
Your Highness must be in a good mood.
You didn't come back the whole night.

390
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:40,334
He tends to indulge in pleasures
and forget about everything else.

391
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:45,894
Judging from the way you carried
her inside, I can tell she's a woman.

392
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,493
You're right.

393
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,124
Don't worry. I'm not someone
who meddles in other's business.

394
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,683
I just want to remind Your Highness

395
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:57,124
that with a war at hand,
it's better that you send her away soon

396
00:33:57,124 --> 00:34:00,413
especially since she is a mortal.

397
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,203
I think so too.

398
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:07,554
For her safety, I'd rather not have
others know about her existence.

399
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:08,943
To thank Your Highness for coming

400
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,534
to Chang Sea personally
to alleviate our suffering

401
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,414
I will not breathe a word about this.

402
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:14,014
Thank you.

403
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:17,744
Back to the topic of the war between
Chang Sea and the mermaid clan...

404
00:34:17,744 --> 00:34:20,523
my uncle really doesn't
want to start a war.

405
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:23,643
He doesn't want to have a complete
fallout with the mermaid clan.

406
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,574
You've been here for thousands of years
and know the situation here best.

407
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:29,793
Is there any way to make him
make a decision quickly?

408
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,884
There is.

409
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,923
Your Highness, don't hesitate anymore.

410
00:34:42,923 --> 00:34:45,134
Second Prince of West Sea
doesn't have any concubines yet.

411
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,724
If you marry him,
you'll be the princess consort.

412
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,764
And I also heard that

413
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:53,164
First Prince of West Sea
has been ill for a long time.

414
00:34:53,164 --> 00:34:54,673
In the future, the position of
Water King of the West Sea

415
00:34:54,673 --> 00:34:56,344
will be Second Prince Die Feng's.

416
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:01,134
Every day, he just wields weapons
and fights with the mermaid clan.

417
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:04,423
Besides, I've known him
for thousands of years

418
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:06,614
and he's never felt anything for me.

419
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:09,224
In just a few days, how could he...

420
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:15,233
Your Highness, look. I found a way to
get First Princess's secret recipe.

421
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:18,744
I specially gathered the earliest
morning dew to make this fine wine.

422
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,483
Take it and try it.

423
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:26,824
Your Highness, don't hesitate anymore.

424
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:31,304
If a woman puts her mind to it,
anything is possible.

425
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:34,983
Your Highness, look. Speak of the devil.
Second Prince is here.

426
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,994
Die Feng.

427
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,224
This is?

428
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,224
This is my friend.

429
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:02,224
Friend? Your friend should have a name.

430
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,403
Hua Ye.

431
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:11,264
What a nice name.

432
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:15,773
It's very similar to the Crown Prince
of the Nine Heaven's name.

433
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:21,023
I guess people with such nice
names must all be sage-like.

434
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:43,264
Father plans to make the wedding day
the third of next month.

435
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:45,313
That soon?

436
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,403
It is soon

437
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:51,494
but I guess he's afraid some accident
might happen again on the wedding day.

438
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:53,744
Accident?

439
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,623
I'm afraid that Qing Qiu's Bai Qian

440
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:58,333
is scared of her second
fiance getting taken away.

441
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,563
So she's wants to marry
into the family quickly.

442
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,804
What a pity.

443
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,744
My aunt is the most
beautiful in all the realms.

444
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,184
What would she be scared of?

445
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,403
Besides, the patriarchs
arranged this marriage.

446
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:13,664
She might not even
look kindly upon her fiance.

447
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,333
Why would she be scared
of him getting taken away?

448
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,623
Dijun, try this. This nut is really good.

449
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,483
Si Ming told me to treat you well.

450
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,164
Okay.

451
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,693
Little Princess, you've helped me.

452
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,534
I was going to lose this game.

453
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:42,014
But this is great.

454
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:52,543
Dijun.

455
00:37:55,884 --> 00:38:00,114
What was Qing Qiu's response for making
the third of next month the wedding day?

456
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,094
They haven't given a response yet.

457
00:38:13,864 --> 00:38:16,884
First, Heavenly Lord made a proclamation

458
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:20,664
about Bai Qian's great service
by sealing Qing Cang.

459
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:24,284
Then he seized the opportunity
to have this wedding.

460
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:26,934
But now that we don't
know where Bai Qian is

461
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,423
how am I supposed to answer them?

462
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:35,244
With Qian Qian missing,
who cares about this wedding?

463
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:38,963
Why don't we just
break off the engagement?

464
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,753
We can't break off the engagement.

465
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:46,324
You and I personally
arranged this marriage back then.

466
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,704
If we can't hastily break off the
engagement without a good reason

467
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:52,293
we'll definitely be criticized.

468
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:55,523
That's right. Fifth Sister's engagement
with Second Prince was already broken.

469
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:57,824
If her engagement with
Crown Prince is broken too

470
00:38:57,824 --> 00:39:00,164
no one in all the realms would
ever dare to propose marriage.

471
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:03,094
Even if they were interested, they'd be
afraid of offending the Celestial Tribe.

472
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:05,233
Wouldn't that be worse for Fifth Sister?

473
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,304
But they want the wedding
on the third of next month.

474
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,813
Where are we going to find
a Bai Qian for the wedding?

475
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,574
Why don't we say this?

476
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:17,063
Now that everyone in the four seas
knows that Bai Qian sealed Qing Cang

477
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,143
we can say that she was
injured, and is recuperating.

478
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:23,954
We can use this to delay the wedding.

479
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:26,244
That's not a bad idea.

480
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:33,724
We could, but we can't just
keep delaying the wedding.

481
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:45,713
When I first went through godly
ascension, I also slept for a millennium.

482
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:47,804
As long as Bai Qian is still alive

483
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:51,844
no matter where she is,
we will eventually find her.

484
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:03,684
Ye Hua, that princess
has been following us

485
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,414
from the Crystal Palace to here.

486
00:40:06,414 --> 00:40:09,563
Will she follow us to bed at night?

487
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:12,054
Now it's your turn to get jealous.

488
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:15,664
There are a lot of
injured soldiers inside.

489
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,623
It wouldn't be good for a woman to enter.

490
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,784
Wait for me here.

491
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:35,204
Sir, is Hua Ye married?

492
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:39,403
From what I know, he has a wife at home.

493
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,563
What?

494
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:44,244
What kind of person is she?

495
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,494
She's a mortal.

496
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:51,083
Mortal?

497
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:55,393
Then if I marry him, he doesn't
have to be a mortal anymore.

498
00:40:56,693 --> 00:40:59,043
Marry him?

499
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:02,603
Yes. If I transfer some of my magic
powers to him, he can become an immortal.

500
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,403
That wouldn't be impossible.

501
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:07,023
It's just that if I marry him

502
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:09,923
I'll have to be the legal wife,
since I'm a princess.

503
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:13,934
He will have to divorce his mortal wife.

504
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:19,364
She has to be treated that way
because she's a mortal?

505
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:22,744
No. Sir, please don't misunderstand.

506
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:25,074
I don't look down on mortals.

507
00:41:25,074 --> 00:41:27,083
It's just that there are differences
between mortals and immortals.

508
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,893
If he marries me,
he has to become immortal.

509
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:33,293
If he becomes immortal,
he can't be with his mortal wife.

510
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:36,463
It's because that's our rule.

511
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:41,244
Then we'll have to see if he
wants to become immortal.

512
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,673
Why would a mortal not want
to become an immortal?

513
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:58,534
