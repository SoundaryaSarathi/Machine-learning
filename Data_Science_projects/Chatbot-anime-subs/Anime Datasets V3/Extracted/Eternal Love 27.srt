<i>[Episode 27]</i>

4
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,699
Dijun, are you unsure?

5
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,349
In the past few days, Dijun saved
Qing Qiu's Little Princess twice

6
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,794
and used his power to suppress Qing Cang
whenever the Bell of the East Emperor

7
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,550
- was acting up, so--
- No need to say those things.

8
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,090
Save Ye Hua first.

9
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,830
Put the Soul-gathering Lamp
in front of his bed for three days.

10
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,050
Keep it burning for three days.

11
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,490
Ye Hua's soul will get better.

12
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,340
You must look after the lamp yourself
for three days.

13
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,819
You can't take the easy way out and
use your powers to look after it.

14
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,530
Okay.

15
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,139
<i>I, Ye Hua, ask all the gods
of the world to bear witness</i>

16
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,120
<i>in front of the Lakes of the Far East.</i>

17
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,500
<i>From this day forth,
I will be married to Su Su.</i>

18
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,620
<i>I will love her with all my heart
for all eternity.</i>

19
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,599
<i>And never part from her
regardless of fortune or calamity.</i>

20
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,020
<i>I, Su Su, ask all the gods
of the world to bear witness</i>

21
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,650
<i>in front of the Lakes of the Far East.</i>

22
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,520
<i>From this day forth,
I will be married to Ye Hua.</i>

23
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
<i>I will love him with all my heart
for all eternity.</i>

24
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,139
<i>And never part from him,
regardless of fortune or calamity.</i>

25
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,650
Ye Hua.

26
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:16,009
I didn't think we would end up like this.

27
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,040
It's a pity that in the end,
it's an ill-fated relationship.

28
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,639
From now on, there will no longer be
Su Su of Mount Junji of the Far East.

29
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,889
When I wake up from the dream,
I will forget everything in the dream.

30
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,050
- Ye Hua.
- Ye Hua.

31
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,680
- Ye Hua.
- Ye Hua.

32
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,220
- Ye Hua.
- Ye Hua.

33
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,970
Hurry! Hurry! Medicine King!

34
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,959
Lian Song.

35
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,290
Father.

36
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:09,680
The past few days I've been thinking,
was I too strict with Ye Hua?

37
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,279
For the past thousands of years
he's been living according to my wishes.

38
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,759
When he first learned to sit,
he was sent to the study.

39
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,009
He would sit for 14 hours a day.

40
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,399
I also remember that
he was too young for that.

41
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,860
He couldn't understand the scriptures.

42
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,920
He cried to his mother, so she came
to me to plea for leniency.

43
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,079
I was furious.

44
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,459
A warm and caring mother
will ruin a child.

45
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:51,790
But after that, he didn't see his mother

46
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,879
until he ascended to
become a high immortal.

47
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,009
Since you are asking me,
I will answer you honestly.

48
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,839
When others speak of
Crown Prince Ye Hua

49
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,779
they always say that he became a high
immortal at the age of 20,000.

50
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,189
He studied under Spiritual Master Ci Hang
and Lord Yuan Shi.

51
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,019
He far exceeds God of War Mo Yuan.

52
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,420
But in my eyes, he's always been
a pitiful child.

53
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,980
He's been alone since he was young.

54
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,180
He's never had any playmates.

55
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,410
I won't keep it from you.
I tease him privately

56
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,259
that he doesn't have a perfect life.

57
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,689
He's never even tried loving anyone.

58
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,689
But when he met Su Su,
someone he truly wanted to love

59
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,129
who knew he would
end up in such a state?

60
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,740
This child values her relationships.

61
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,399
Mo Yuan was only her
master for 20,000 years.

62
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:16,740
Yet she used blood from her heart
to nourish his body every day.

63
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,740
How could this happen?

64
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,129
For her godly ascension to high goddess,
she had to go through heartbreak again.

65
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,930
When she asked me for the
amnesia potion she was deeply hurt.

66
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,330
I think it's okay if she wakes up
and forgets everything.

67
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,440
We'll pretend we don't know anything.

68
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,059
I've healed her sight.

69
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,610
But her eyes won't be able to
withstand intense light.

70
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,440
I never lie.

71
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,070
Whether we can get her to
believe us all depends on you.

72
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,809
Me? Why me?

73
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,559
What? You don't want to?

74
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,720
I wouldn't dare. I'll do as you say.

75
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,200
Why do we have to keep it from her?

76
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,529
It's her heavenly trial.

77
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,600
They all went through it in the past.

78
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,220
It's just that this girl
has injuries all over her body.

79
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,450
It breaks my heart just looking at her.

80
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,750
All right. What do you know?

81
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,750
If she couldn't handle it, why would
she ask Zhe Yan for the amnesia potion?

82
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,009
This is fine. If she wants to forget,
then let her forget.

83
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
That's right.

84
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,629
We'll just tell her  she was injured in
the battle against Qing Cang

85
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,789
so she fell into a deep sleep.

86
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,240
As for her eyes...

87
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,509
we'll say that it was a disease
from when she was born.

88
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,259
It was dormant.

89
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,309
It was activated after she was hurt.

90
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay. That's what we'll tell her.

91
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,779
Will you remember all of that?

92
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll remember.

93
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,080
Go to the Yellow Springs.

94
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,559
Use dark rays to find a white silk
that can block intense lights

95
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,870
so that Bai Qian can wear it.

96
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,690
Okay. I'll go now.

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,850
My mother and father
always listen to you.

98
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,129
They agree with everything you say.

99
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,409
I haven't asked you before.

100
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:43,629
Before I was born,
how did you know my parents?

101
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,539
Before you were born?

102
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,169
Back then, I was the first to fall
in love with your mother.

103
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:53,980
But your mother insisted on
your unromantic father.

104
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,169
After battling with your father

105
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,460
I found that our personalities
were complimentary

106
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,860
so we just became friends.

107
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,710
That happened?

108
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,960
Yes. So you should thank me.

109
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,460
If I didn't give up on
your mother

110
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,120
you all wouldn't be here today.

111
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,620
You're shameless.

112
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,419
My mother couldn't possibly
fall for an old phoenix like you.

113
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,159
Old phoenix?

114
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,419
Zhen Zhen, do you remember
when you were a week old

115
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,440
you did everything you could
to climb on me to give me a kiss?

116
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
Old Phoenix, is there a point in
bringing up things when I was one?

117
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,000
There is.

118
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,169
Ye Hua.

119
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,799
Don't look so hurt.

120
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,179
It breaks my heart.

121
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:26,610
I got amnesia potion from Medicine King.

122
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,200
Drink it.

123
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,120
You'll forget Su Su after you drink it.

124
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,940
Then you'll become the
crown prince you were before.

125
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
I won't ask that you
achieve anything great.

126
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:52,120
I just want you to
live a nice life.

127
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,970
I don't want to forget her.

128
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,889
You've been sleeping well.

129
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,039
Fourth Brother.

130
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,500
Why do I feel like I can't see clearly?

131
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,720
The light is dazzling.

132
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,179
Don't get worked up.

133
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,490
Zhe Yan is also worried about your eyes.

134
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,980
It'll be fine after a while.

135
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,110
But you can't look at
anything too bright.

136
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,789
Why is that?

137
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,570
You were born with this illness.

138
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,370
When Mother was pregnant with you

139
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,399
Heavenly Lord Zheng Feng
created a huge flood

140
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,139
to punish the people of all the realms.

141
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,549
After the flood,
there wasn't anything to eat.

142
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:20,889
Since Mother couldn't eat anything,
she was weak.

143
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,259
So when you were born
you were just a wrinkly little fox.

144
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,700
You had a weird eye disease.

145
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,309
How come I've never had
this happen to me before?

146
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:36,029
The disease was dormant
for thousands of years.

147
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,899
It lived in harmony with you for years.

148
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,179
But when you were injured,
it took the opportunity to break out.

149
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,120
But fortunately,
Father went to the Yellow Springs

150
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,669
to get this white silk that
blocks intense rays for you.

151
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,320
When you go to places that are really
bright, it will come out naturally.

152
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,120
It'll only block off the intense rays
and won't affect what you see.

153
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,509
Fourth Brother, when did I get injured?

154
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,070
You've slept for thousands of years
since the battle against Qing Cang.

155
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,320
I don't really remember everything
that happened in between very clearly.

156
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,690
My dear High Goddess Bai Qian.

157
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,879
High Goddess?

158
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,759
Look at your spirit.

159
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,039
Can you see that you've ascended
to a high goddess?

160
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,379
How did I pass my heavenly trial?

161
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,379
I just battled against Qing Cang
and slept for thousands of years.

162
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,370
Did I ascend in my dreams?

163
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,740
You're very lucky.

164
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,179
Compared to my
high immortal heavenly trial?

165
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,429
Your luck has improved this time around.

166
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,960
- I must go.
- What's wrong?

167
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,320
I've been asleep all these years.
Master...

168
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,460
Without blood from my heart, Master...

169
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,809
Fifth Sister!

170
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,929
- Where's Master?
- You're awake.

171
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,799
Go and see for yourself.

172
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,029
Master, your unfilial disciple
has come to see you.

173
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,740
I've been asleep all these years.

174
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,950
Why hasn't Master's body changed at all?

175
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,679
Mo Yuan's body has been preserved very
well even without blood from your heart.

176
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,679
From the looks of it,
it seems Mo Yuan will wake up soon.

177
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,990
Mi Gu.

178
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,970
- Mi Gu.
- Aunt.

179
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,160
Why do you look so concerned?

180
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,900
Ever since Little Princess came
back from the Celestial Palace

181
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,549
she's been drinking nonstop.

182
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,819
Bai Yi brought her home.

183
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,769
But started beating her when
they couldn't talk things though.

184
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,779
I secretly saved her.

185
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,460
When Little Princess was getting beaten

186
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,680
she wouldn't cry even
though she was bleeding.

187
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,759
Since she's been here, she hasn't spoken.

188
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,359
Aunt, hurry and go see her.

189
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,680
Feng Jiu, why did you drink so much?

190
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,200
Wine isn't good for you.

191
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:37,319
Of course, the wine that Zhe Yan
makes is the best thing in the world.

192
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,460
But you can't just drown
your sorrows in alcohol.

193
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,309
You're wasting Zhe Yan's work.

194
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,980
You must know that alcohol will only
give you relief for a moment.

195
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,019
When you sober up, the things
that trouble you will still be there.

196
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,259
Aunt, it's not because
I'm worried about anything.

197
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,309
I know that drinking won't
get rid of my problems.

198
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:16,289
It's just that if I don't drink,
I'll want to cry from the pain.

199
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,000
So that's why I keep drinking.

200
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,220
I can't cry in front of Dijun.

201
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't cry in front of anyone else.

202
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,359
I can only cry here.

203
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,650
Aunt, look at me.

204
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,279
I have to find a safe place just to cry.

205
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,789
How pitiful.

206
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,180
Fourth Brother, leave it to me.

207
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,759
Let the two of us have a nice chat.

208
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,440
Okay, okay. I'll leave it to you.

209
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,089
I don't know what you women think.

210
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:06,500
What should I say about you?

211
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,759
So many things happened
to you in such a short time.

212
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,759
Tell me what's going on with
you and Dong Hua Dijun.

213
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,960
Let me see if I can
reason things out for you.

214
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,480
That day when you left
me at Kunlun Mountain

215
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,839
Dijun came and...

216
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,880
Don't cry anymore. Don't cry anymore.

217
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,119
Don't cry.

218
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,490
I know what you're crying about.

219
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:47,250
The person who caused your mother
to lose her eyes and her life

220
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,259
is going to marry your father tonight.

221
00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:00,490
If she hadn't jumped down Zhuxian Terrace
she would be the one entering Xiwu Palace

222
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,339
not the woman
who did those things to her.

223
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,460
All right, all right. Don't cry.

224
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,599
Let's not cry.

225
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,410
Be good.

226
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:24,000
Aunt, why did I fall for Dong Hua Dijun?

227
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,170
You're asking me?
Who am I supposed to ask?

228
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,339
I should be asking you.

229
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,730
You're the only granddaughter
of Qing Qiu's king.

230
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,710
You could fall for anyone.

231
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,960
But you just had to fall for the
former ruler of the world.

232
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,809
Dong Hua Dijun is higher ranked
than the Heavenly Lord.

233
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,599
He was once the ruler of the whole world.

234
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,309
You must know that even
before your father was born

235
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,809
Dong Hua Dijun was
already ruling the world.

236
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,559
I know.

237
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,079
Si Ming told me.

238
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,269
Then why are you wasting your
time thinking about this problem?

239
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:08,089
It would be great if reason could get
someone to stop loving another person.

240
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,339
Aunt, have you ever liked anyone?

241
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:20,130
Were you also immature like me?

242
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,079
I have.

243
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,819
Really? Who in this world
made you fall for him?

244
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,799
Hurry and tell me.

245
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,289
It's better that I don't talk about it.

246
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,759
It was when I was at Kunlun Mountain.

247
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,769
It's very embarrassing.

248
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,230
I once told you

249
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,980
that the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun is
Kunlun Mountain's magic artifact.

250
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,980
I can't find out how many
owners it's passed through

251
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,619
and what it's been through.

252
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,839
Ye Hua, why are you investigating Mo
Yuan's whereabouts right after waking up?

253
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,579
Father has sent people to
investigate this for 70,000 years.

254
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,640
There have been no leads.

255
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,240
The Celestial Tribe has done all it can.

256
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,920
Si Yin and Mo Yuan's
disappearance can't be that simple.

257
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,789
Si Yin is Mo Yuan's favorite disciple.

258
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:43,420
But he wouldn't let his master
be buried in the Sea of Innocence.

259
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,130
Instead, he stole and hid the body.

260
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,609
The most probable reason
for doing this is that

261
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:54,509
he wants to bring
Mo Yuan come back to life.

262
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:57,579
I once thought that too.

263
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,819
But even if the two of them are alive

264
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,299
you don't have to
investigate it right now.

265
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,359
You should recuperate.

266
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,400
I want to find Si Yin.

267
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,109
I want to know the method of bringing
Mo Yuan back to life.

268
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,700
You want to make Su Su come back to life?

269
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,839
If Your Highness wants
to know Si Yin's whereabouts

270
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,720
I know someone who might have some clues.

271
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,450
Who?

272
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,299
Bai Feng Jiu.

273
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,930
Qing Qiu Bai Qian's niece?

274
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,250
Precisely.

275
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,099
I feel like she knows something.

276
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,750
I'll go to Qing Qiu.

277
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,049
Now? Did you forget that you're
getting married to Su Jin today?

278
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,000
Am I? I forgot.

279
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,869
You are?

280
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:12,200
I am Celestial Crown Prince Ye Hua.

281
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,140
I'd like to see Qing Qiu's
Princess Bai Feng Jiu.

282
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,900
Crown prince?

283
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,680
I'll go tell her and ask her to come out.

284
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,849
Aunt, I got your Cloud Clearing Fan back.

285
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:30,829
Did Mi Gu return it to you?

286
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,500
He did.

287
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,170
He also told me that to temporarily
forget what Dijun did to make you sad

288
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,210
you went to North Sea to cause trouble.

289
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,880
Not really.

290
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,779
It's just that since coming back
from Celestial Palace

291
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,470
I've completely given up.

292
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,980
I suddenly remembered that I forgot
to teach Shao Xing a lesson for you

293
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,900
so I got the energy
to go yell at her for you.

294
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,150
I know you treat me best.

295
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,839
Even though you're disheartened,
you didn't forget to stand up for me.

296
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,740
Of course!

297
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:06,220
Aunt, Crown Prince Ye Hua is here.

298
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,440
Isn't my marriage with his
second uncle already canceled?

299
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,900
What is he doing here?

300
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,289
Aunt, that guy is
unfaithful and heartless.

301
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,779
You must not marry him!

302
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,539
Why would I marry him?

303
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,049
You must now know.

304
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:22,009
After your battle with Qing Cang and
when you were sleeping to recuperate

305
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:26,259
Fox King and High God Zhe Yan personally
arranged this marriage for you.

306
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,660
What marriage?

307
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,059
Breaking off your marriage
with Celestial Second Prince

308
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,119
and marrying Crown Prince Ye Hua instead.

309
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,279
Why didn't I know about this?

310
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,859
Didn't you just wake up?

311
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:43,200
Maybe Fourth Uncle and High God Zhe Yan
didn't get the chance to tell you yet.

312
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,950
Wasn't my marriage with his second uncle
just get canceled?

313
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,730
Why am I in an arranged
marriage with him now?

314
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,880
I will go talk to them
to break off this marriage.

315
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,180
Aunt, you must not.

316
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,720
This is more important than the marriage
with the Water King of the North Sea.

317
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,470
Back then it was just an engagement

318
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,789
but now your marriage
with the crown prince

319
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:06,569
is something Heavenly Lord and Fox King
swore to in front of the whole world.

320
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,059
If you really break it off

321
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,450
it'll make Qing Qiu and Celestial Tribe
look really bad.

322
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,319
What were my mother and father thinking?

323
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,690
Forget it. Tell the crown prince
to leave.

324
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,759
I don't want to see him.

325
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,480
Aunt, you're not the one
Crown Prince wants to see.

326
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,579
It's Feng Jiu.

327
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,400
Feng Jiu?

328
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,640
Are you close with him?

329
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,529
Absolutely not. I hate him.

330
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,809
Really?

331
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,069
Yes.

332
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:43,740
Celestial Tribe's crown prince personally
came to Qing Qiu to see you.

333
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,410
Did you cause some trouble?

334
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,799
I really didn't.

335
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,289
But his cousin also likes Dong Hua.

336
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:56,809
Maybe he's here to teach me
a lesson for his cousin?

337
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,009
You and his cousin fought?

338
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,049
No!

339
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:06,130
Why would I fight with
such a delicate girl?

340
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,740
Forget it. I'll just go out and ask.

341
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,549
Go ahead.

342
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,599
But don't tell him I'm here.

343
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,400
Your Highness.

344
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,279
I've been around Taichen Palace,
but  I've never talked to Your Highness.

345
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,490
Why is Your Highness
here to see me today?

346
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,589
I came here today to personally ask you
if you've heard of High Immortal Si Yin.

347
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,519
<i>Why did Dijun ask me
and why is he asking me too?</i>

348
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,779
<i>Si Ming must have said something.</i>

349
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,690
Si Yin? I've heard about him
from High God Zhe Yan.

350
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,329
He brought a fox to
Kunlun Mountain to train.

351
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:59,789
Is he the one Your Highness
is talking about?

352
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:05,730
Precisely. Do you know where he
went 70,000 years ago, after the war?

353
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,470
I don't know.

354
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,130
I understand.

355
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,789
Goodbye.

356
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,450
He wanted to see me to ask that?

357
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,970
Congratulations, Your Highness.

358
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,519
I don't know why but I don't dare
to step out of this palace.

359
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,500
Marrying into Xiwu Palace has
been your wish for years.

360
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,660
You should be happy.

361
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,039
What are you scared of now?

362
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm afraid he'll mind that I used to
be a consort of the Celestial Palace.

363
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,160
You've been through a lot.

364
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,210
Heavenly Lord bestowed this marriage

365
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,089
but His Highness won't go through a
grand wedding ceremony with you.

366
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,819
He just told us to sit
in a carriage and go.

367
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,769
That's not important.

368
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:59,740
What's important is starting today,
I am a side consort of Xiwu Palace.

369
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,829
Ye Hua's side consort.

370
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,750
Your Highness, the people outside
are saying that

371
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,650
Consort Su Jin's carriage is almost here.

372
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,339
Is it?

373
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:39,339
Your Highness,
you're not going to change?

374
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,539
The red candles in the
palace hurt my eyes.

375
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,740
Change them all for me.

376
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,839
Yes.

377
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,440
Your Highness, look.

378
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,289
His Highness didn't want
to make things hard for you

379
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,710
so he came out to welcome you himself.

380
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,289
Ye Hua.

381
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,160
You're back.

382
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,269
Why do you still hate talking?

383
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,960
It's okay. I already know
what you're like.

384
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,849
Since you don't like talking,
I'll just talk more.

385
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,250
<i>From when you were born,
you were my only family.</i>

386
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:55,250
<i>Ye Hua, trust me.</i>

387
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:03,740
<i>In this world, no other woman</i>
<i>will treat you better than I do.</i>

388
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,039
Husband.

389
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,730
Your Highness, please don't be angry...

390
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,650
Why?

391
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,820
Before sealing Qing Cang
I once stole a bottle of wine.

392
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,050
Now I'm returning it.

393
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:06,320
Ninth loved coming here to find me.

394
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:10,860
He was the one who
always came here to clean

395
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,409
even though he didn't drink.

396
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:25,789
If he were here today,
he'd probably be really busy.

397
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,579
Where's my Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

398
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,900
<i>The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
suddenly disappeared.</i>

399
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,210
<i>Could it have been summoned by its owner?</i>

400
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,900
<i>Or did it go somewhere else?</i>

401
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,210
<i>Where could a Kunlun magic artifact go?</i>

402
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,130
<i>Could it be Si Yin?</i>

403
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,929
I am an unfilial disciple.

404
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,559
I almost lost you.

405
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:36,800
<i>The rumors are true.</i>

406
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,679
<i>The disciples of Kunlun Mountain
have scattered.</i>

407
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,050
<i>This hall has been
abandoned for 70,000 years.</i>

408
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,650
<i>There's nothing alive here.</i>

409
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,519
I've waited a long time for you.

410
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,440
Where did you go?

411
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,619
I went to Kunlun Mountain.

412
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,099
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
disappeared all of a sudden.

413
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:20,110
I thought maybe its owner,
Si Yin, returned.

414
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,340
Mo Yuan is Heavenly Father's son.

415
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,369
The fact that his body's whereabouts
are unknown

416
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:27,059
is also something that's
bothered me for years.

417
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:33,730
If we can find Si Yin,
we might really be able to find Mo Yuan.

418
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,050
It's a pity.

419
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,320
He wasn't at Kunlun Mountain.

420
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,550
But it's been 70,000 years.

421
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,239
We can't rush this.

422
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:53,969
Today, I waited for you to come back
because of Su Jin.

423
00:40:56,409 --> 00:41:01,400
Back then, when she offered the
Soul-gathering Lamp in front of everyone

424
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:05,289
I consented for her to
marry into Xiwu Palace.

425
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:09,619
It was an imperial decree.
She is already your side consort.

426
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:16,130
Whether you acknowledge it or not
it won't change.

427
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,789
Since I have to answer to all the realms

428
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,559
I can only acknowledge
this Imperial decree.

429
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,679
But Xiwu Palace has many buildings.

430
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,019
Besides the Hall of Beautiful Youth
and Zichen Palace

431
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:40,019
I don't care where she lives.

432
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,619
Your Highness, Her Highness
would like to see you!

433
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,269
Her Highness says
she has a way to save Su Su!

434
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:13,269
