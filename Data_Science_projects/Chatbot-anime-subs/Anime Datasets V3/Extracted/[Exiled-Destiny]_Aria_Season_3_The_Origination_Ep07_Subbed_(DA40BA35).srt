00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,600
When you're gazing out at the sea,
surrounded by the sound of waves...

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,240
...you lose track of time, don't you?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,740
It just goes to show that it's better to be busy.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,210
But if you're too busy,
you also lose track of time.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,840
You lose track of time either way, then.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,050
It can't be helped, I guess.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,350
We're sorry, pui

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,650
"Dear Ai, today is the
Aria Company's anniversary."

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,650
"That's right, it's the day that
Grandma founded the Aria Company!"

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,700
"We'll be closed all day today,
and together with Alicia and President Aria,"

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,670
We're sorry, pui

"the three of us are going on a little trip.
We've been looking forward to it for a while."

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,170
My, my.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,650
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,760
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,970
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,850
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,350
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,910
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,160
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:49,630
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:59,440
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

27
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,350
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,720
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare
Wow! It's a bicycle!

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,650
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru
Wow! It's a bicycle!

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,690
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru
On Neo-Burano Island, children up to
twelve years old are allowed to ride bicycles.

31
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,430
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru
This is the first time I've seen
a bicycle since coming to Aqua.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,800
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara
This is the first time I've seen
a bicycle since coming to Aqua.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,600
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,100
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,980
There are a lot of colorful houses, aren't there?

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,990
Burano Island back on Manhome was also
a fishing village, just like this one.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,790
It's said that the fishermen's wives
painted the houses in various colors...

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,300
...so the returning fishermen could find
their houses, even on a dark and foggy night.

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,270
It seems that tradition is still
alive and well here today.

40
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,170
This is the Venetian lace that was popular
in Manhome's Venice, isn't it?

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,880
Yes. Nets are necessary to fish, right?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,080
So lace was developed
from the art of weaving nets.

43
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,950
It looks like the art of lace-making has been
passed down to Aqua, hasn't it?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,430
I'm sure the bride who wears
that dress will look stunning.

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,870
The woman we're going to visit now, Anna,
was also very beautiful in her lace wedding dress.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,070
Really?

47
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,240
Um, so what kind of person is Anna?

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,850
Let's see... She was a cheerful
and glamorous Undine.

49
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,680
She had many male fans,
and was much busier than I am now.

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,320
Wow! She sounds amazing!
It makes me kind of nervous.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,290
My, my.

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,820
In That Gently Passing Time...

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,410
It's this house, Alicia.

54
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,280
Hello!

55
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,000
Huh...

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,700
Maybe she's not home? I'm pretty sure
this is the time we agreed on, but...

57
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,940
Huh?

58
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,600
Huh?
Huh?

59
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,470
Hello!

60
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,350
Wha?

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,620
Please wait! There's
something I'd like to ask you!

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,650
That boy...

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,860
What's the matter?

64
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,920
There were two ladies at our gate.

65
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,070
U-Umm...

66
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,830
That uniform...

67
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,310
Anna.

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,770
Long time no see, Alicia.

69
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,550
Then, you must be...

70
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,750
Ah, yes. Pleased to meet you!
I'm Akari Mizunashi.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,390
Hello, Akari. I'm Anna.

72
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,480
And this is my son, Ahito.

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,590
Hello, Ahito.

74
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,560
H-Hello.

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,530
Oh? What's this, Ahito? You're blushing.

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm not blushing!

77
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,370
My, my. Are you flustered?

78
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,170
Shut up, hag!

79
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,470
Whaaaat?!

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,140
Stop it!

81
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,500
My, my.

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,990
Such beautiful lace work.

83
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,850
It's wonderful!

84
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,990
Grandma made it.

85
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,060
Huh? Your grandmother?

86
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,600
Yeah. My grandma is a famous
lace maker on this island.

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,370
Mom's getting lessons from her right now.

88
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,270
She's still bad at it, though.

89
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,860
Hey!

90
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,910
That was given to me as a wedding gift.

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,100
Everything else is either my own work,
or was given to me by someone else.

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,030
Back when Anna was
working at the Aria Company...

93
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,800
...a fisherman from this island, now her husband,
was visiting Neo-Venezia with his mother.

94
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,440
She soon fell in love with that kind fisherman
who cared so much about his mother.

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,590
Thank you so much for forgiving my selfishness.

96
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,820
Not at all, Anna. Congratulations.

97
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,190
This is a wonderful reason.

98
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,130
To see you follow your own path without
any hesitation makes me very happy.

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,030
Thank you very much, Grandma.

100
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,300
Please take care.

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,240
Thank you, Alicia.

102
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,280
Take care of yourself.

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,210
I will.

104
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,310
The Aria Company was
the high point of my youth.

105
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,460
It's pudgy-wudgy!

106
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,660
It was a happy marriage, wasn't it?

107
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,700
Not exactly.

108
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm joking.

109
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,250
But there were hardships.

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,220
Getting married and moving was fine, but life here
was completely different from my life as an Undine.

111
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,560
I didn't know anyone.
My husband was always out fishing.

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,890
I became alienated from the islanders,
so I had a hard time getting to know them.

113
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,260
It was really lonely.

114
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,040
But after I started learning how to make lace,
I gradually got to know the islanders.

115
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,450
In some cases, we had up to five people
working on a single lace project.

116
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,820
Five people?

117
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,450
Each of these lace embroideries
was done by a different person,

118
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:56,130
and they entrusted me with making the bridge
embroideries that connect each section.

119
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,790
I was so happy.

120
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,570
That embroidery became the real bridge that
connected you and the islanders, didn't it?

121
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,340
Yeah.

122
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,210
Whoa, great way to put it, Akari!

123
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,510
Ah! I'm sorry.

124
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,940
My, my.

125
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,180
I wonder if Grandma is doing well.

126
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,380
Ah, sounds like Alberto's back from fishing.

127
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,650
Welcome home.

128
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,290
Grandma! What are you doing here?

129
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,500
Alicia invited me.

130
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,870
Long time no see, Anna.
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

131
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,640
We just happened to bump into each other.

132
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm so happy to see you, Grandma!

133
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,840
My, my, President Aria.

134
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,610
Hello, Ahito.

135
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,410
Hello.

136
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,560
Nice to meet you. I'm Alberto.

137
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,420
I'm Akari Mizunashi.

138
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,660
How was it?

139
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,560
Oh, it was a great haul!

140
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,900
Ta-da!

141
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,090
I picked out the ones
that looked especially tasty!

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,900
Looks delicious.

143
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,740
All right. Time to put my
cooking skills into action!

144
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,080
It smells delicious.

145
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,450
Looks like it's cooked just right.

146
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,880
Here I go!

147
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,310
All right!

148
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,750
Are you okay?

149
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,400
Alberto!

150
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,620
Dinner's ready!

151
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,730
Okay! We'll be right there!

152
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,360
Ow...

153
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,770
This looks amazing!

154
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,110
Okay, let's dig in!

155
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,340
Let's eat!
Let's eat!

156
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,140
It's delicious!

157
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,550
The fish is so fresh, it's delicious!

158
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,360
Why, thank you.

159
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,330
Here, Grandma.

160
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,760
Thank you.

161
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,660
Yummy!

162
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,210
Yummy!

163
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,310
This is fantastic!

164
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,230
Looks like he's tired.

165
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,670
He woke up early today, didn't he?

166
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,640
He just got carried away, that's all.

167
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,550
There's a lot of Aria Company
history that I don't know, isn't there?

168
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,660
From the founding of the Aria Company,
to Akari, our newest member...

169
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,290
Somehow, it all makes me really happy.

170
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,330
I think of Ahito as a grandson, as well.

171
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,550
Spending this moment together is like a miracle.

172
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,870
That's right.

173
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,850
A miracle...

174
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,960
It's all thanks to you for founding
the Aria Company, Grandma.

175
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,430
If you hadn't, Alberto and I
would have never met,

176
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,520
and Ahito wouldn't have
been born into this world.

177
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,420
I see you have your feet firmly
on the ground, and cherish every day.

178
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,010
You've found a happiness
that suits you, haven't you?

179
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,350
Thank you very much.

180
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,990
I didn't found the Aria Company on my own.

181
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,640
It was President Aria who gave me the idea.

182
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,610
No, it was more like he saved me.

183
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,470
President Aria did?

184
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,750
Would you mind telling us about that?

185
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,110
Back then, I was at a loss with myself.

186
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,250
It was back when I was still
an Undine at Himeya.

187
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,820
Good work, Akino.

188
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Good work, Akino!
Good work, Akino!

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
Good work.

190
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,070
By that time, I had already been known as
Himeya's ace Undine for over fourteen years.

191
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,550
Akino looks wonderful today, as always.

192
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,520
She changes the mood simply by
passing by, doesn't she?

193
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,590
I heard she had six bookings
back to back yesterday.

194
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,650
That's amazing!

195
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,120
If it were me, I'd definitely be worn out.

196
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,960
Instead of waning, she seems to shine
brighter and brighter with age, doesn't she?

197
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,870
And no matter how busy she is,
she always has a smile on her face.

198
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,100
She truly is the greatest Water Fairy of our time!

199
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,900
Thank you very much.

200
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,060
Bye bye!

201
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,220
Ah, that sure was fun.

202
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,570
Bye bye.

203
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,170
Huh?

204
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,500
Hello, Mr. Cat.

205
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,040
You always seem to be here, lately.

206
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,500
Where did you come from?

207
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,710
What are you doing here every day?

208
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,580
Are you lost, by chance?

209
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,780
Don't you get tired of
always being in the same spot?

210
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,270
I'm sorry. It would be hard to answer
so many questions all at once.

211
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,170
At the time, I enjoyed my work, of course,

212
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,310
but I was so busy that
time seemed to just fly by.

213
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,860
Every so often, I would think
to myself, "What a waste."

214
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,460
"There are so many wonderful
things in this world."

215
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:23,730
"If only I could take the time to
cherish each and every one of them."

216
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,470
Say, Mr. Cat.

217
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,310
What are you always looking at from here?

218
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,550
Are you waiting for something
that's important to you?

219
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:07,250
A white seabird with a tilted neck...
Kubi o kashigeta shiroi umidori

220
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,780
...flew away into the endless sky
Tondetta no anna ni takai sora

221
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:25,230
Soon, a ship sailing beyond the sky...
Sora no mukou no fune ga mousugu

222
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:31,730
...will arrive in the afternoon harbor
Tadoritsuku gogo no minato

223
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,740
Mr. Cat!

224
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,310
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

225
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,150
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku
What could you be waiting for that
you're willing to do this to yourself?

226
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,620
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

227
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:52,160
The person I long to see has gone to a far-off land...
Aitai hito tooi kuni e itta

228
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,390
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no

229
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,100
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no
Mr. Cat...

230
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:05,060
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no

231
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,040
Before I knew it, it was morning.

232
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:22,450
Even though I was out in the rain
all night long, somehow I felt renewed.

233
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,330
Thanks to President Aria,
I realized that I was pushing myself.

234
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,770
The person I long to see...
Aitai hito

235
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,010
The person I long to see...
Aitai hito
And then, together with President Aria,
I founded the Aria Company.

236
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,310
The person I long to see...
Aitai hito

237
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,280
The voice I long to hear...
Kikitai koe

238
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,920
The voice I long to hear...
Kikitai koe
I thought, "That world reflected in his
beautiful blue eyes... I want to see it with him."

239
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,460
I thought, "That world reflected in his
beautiful blue eyes... I want to see it with him."

240
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,230
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

241
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,030
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku
caution,
wet paint

242
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,460
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

243
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:12,840
The person I long to see has gone to a far-off land...
Aitai hito tooi kuni e itta

244
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:25,810
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no

245
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,850
And that's how it all began.

246
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,460
Akari.

247
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,230
Yes?

248
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,900
Someday, your Aria Company will begin.

249
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,760
We're all looking forward to your Aria Company,
which will be unlike anything we've seen before.

250
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,920
Good luck!

251
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,410
Yes, I'll do my best!

252
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,940
My, my.

253
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,790
"Ai, I'm so happy I was allowed to be
a part of the Aria Company."

254
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,060
"Because of that, I'm able to spend
time with such wonderful people."

255
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,130
"Akari, the Aria Company is an amazing place..."

256
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,540
"...because of the thoughts, wishes
and kindness of many people."

257
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,770
"I'm kind of envious!"

258
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,890
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

259
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,520
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

260
00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:00,470
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

261
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:09,410
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

262
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:22,800
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

263
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,900
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

264
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:45,090
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

265
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,620
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

266
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:56,790
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

267
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,190
And my day begins
Hajimaru
