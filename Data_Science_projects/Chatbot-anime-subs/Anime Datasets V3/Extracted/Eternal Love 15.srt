<i>[Episode 15]</i>

4
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,360
Since you understand me, you should know

5
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,479
everything I have done
is so I can marry Ye Hua.

6
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,479
Your Highness, do you mean...

7
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,639
<i>Su Jin.</i>

8
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,159
Heavenly Lord.

9
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,719
I came to see you.

10
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,520
Your Majesty attends to
numerous affairs every day.

11
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,240
You do not need spend
too much of your focus on me.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Tonight, I will enter the palace alone
as you have arranged.

13
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,759
No, I came to tell you

14
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,960
you and I are a married couple
in name only.

15
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,039
You may continue to live here

16
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,360
so as to avoid causing you discomfort
by moving you into my chambers.

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,479
That... would not be proper.

18
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,719
It is of no matter.

19
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Hang some red silk.

21
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,520
After all, you have been made
an imperial consort.

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
It is considered a happy occasion.

23
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,159
Yes, I will prepare it right away.

24
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,439
I am sorry to put you through this.

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,159
It is a contingency plan.
Your Majesty need not blame yourself.

26
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,240
I was just thinking.

27
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,879
Why don't we make use of
the festive occasion of this conferment

28
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,680
and have me return to my clan
tomorrow morning to worship my ancestors

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,439
and visit all my uncles?

30
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,800
It will allow them to understand
Your Majesty's regards for me.

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
Very good.

32
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,639
Rest well tonight.

33
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,599
Tomorrow morning, I will send
Lian Song and Yang Cuo with you.

34
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,800
No, I think it would be best for
Crown Prince to come with me.

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,439
Ye Hua?

36
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,919
That is correct.

37
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,039
Crown Prince is the heir apparent
to the throne.

38
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,759
If His Highness appears with me,
the visit will be made to seem important.

39
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,919
Furthermore, doesn't Your Majesty
have intentions

40
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,240
to have Crown Prince lead the army
in a war against the Mermaid Clan?

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,680
There will be benefits to meeting
the separate leaders in advance.

42
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,800
All right.

43
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:34,040
Tomorrow morning, I'll let Ye Hua know
and have him meet the various leaders.

44
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,560
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,759
<i>[Grand Ziming Palace]</i>

46
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,680
I am doing this because I have no choice.

47
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,240
I am doing this for the family.

48
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,639
I don't want to see the two brothers
destroy each other.

49
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
Li Jing.

50
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,839
Even your most beloved sister
will betray you.

51
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,779
From now on

52
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,439
I will be your closest ally
in Grand Ziming Palace.

53
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:25,279
This way, I know I will win his heart.

54
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,040
Your Majesty.

55
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,000
Your Majesty has drank too much.

56
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,519
Do you want...

57
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,600
Your Highness, since you have obtained
His Majesty's seal, let's move quickly.

58
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,680
Golden Lion.

59
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,560
If I rescue Li Yuan...

60
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,800
will I cause the Ghost Realm
to fall into turmoil again?

61
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,399
Princess, it has been 70,000 years since
Second Prince ascended to the throne.

62
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,000
His position is stable.

63
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,360
Even if your father
were still alive today

64
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
it would still be difficult to jeopardize
Second Prince's position.

65
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
We are only doing this
to save Eldest Prince's life.

66
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,759
Dijun.

67
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,960
I have something to tell you.

68
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,519
Today, Third Prince told me that
there are many in the Celestial Realm

69
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,120
who use the excuse of repaying
your kindness to get close to you.

70
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,480
But that is not the case with me.

71
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,720
Ever since I was young,
my parents taught me that

72
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,080
even a small favor
must be repaid double.

73
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,279
This applies even more so
to a life debt.

74
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,240
I may be young, but I do
understand these principles.

75
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,759
As an immortal, my aunt also taught me
to not be so fixated on prestige

76
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,960
and to speak my mind.

77
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:05,799
Today, Third Prince asked me
if I felt "that way" about you.

78
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,360
I thought about it.

79
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,159
I do feel "that way" about you.

80
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,519
Do you understand, Dijun?

81
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,919
Are you finished speaking?

82
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
I... I'm finished.

83
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,759
If you're done, then you may go.

84
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,480
You're not leaving?

85
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,279
I'm going.

86
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,120
Who is this palace maid
that has come to repay a debt to you?

87
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,399
Qing Qiu's young princess, Bai Feng Jiu.

88
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
Bai Feng Jiu?

89
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,240
She shouldn't be offended.

90
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,440
But how did you save her life?

91
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,120
By chance.

92
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,399
By chance?

93
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,840
I can't believe it.
She is a princess?

94
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't underestimate this princess.

95
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,240
She is the only grandchild
of Qing Qiu's royal family.

96
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,519
In the future, she will be inheriting
one of the five lands of Qing Qiu.

97
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
And ascend the throne
as a female monarch.

98
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,320
So what?

99
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,399
You are young and frivolous,
and have no sense of propriety.

100
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,279
In any case, remember my words.

101
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,440
Do not offend those from Qing Qiu.

102
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,960
Yes.

103
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,279
However, Dijun has long since been
unconcerned with mundane affairs.

104
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,799
It seems this young princess's efforts...

105
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,639
will be in vain.

106
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,799
I heard you have taken the orphan
of the Su Jin Clan as your consort.

107
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,840
That is correct.

108
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,962
It's been a long time since there's been
a festive occasion

109
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:26,846
in the Celestial Palace.

110
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,639
Su Su!

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,120
Ye Hua! Run!

112
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,600
Su Su.

113
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,039
What did you do this time?

114
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,399
I wanted to roast a chicken for you.

115
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,720
Didn't we agree I would do it?

116
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,919
You have been cooking
for me all this time.

117
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,039
I feel bad about it.

118
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,759
Our wedding outfits!

119
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,240
Don't go!

120
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,080
The fire is so big.
Our wedding outfits are long gone.

121
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,240
They were the outfits
we wore as newlyweds.

122
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,759
It is once in a lifetime.

123
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,679
If you like, we could be
newlyweds every day.

124
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,200
Ye Hua.

125
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,559
You are very good at sweet talk.

126
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,399
Our house has burned down.

127
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,159
Where will we stay tonight?

128
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,600
Where do you want to live?

129
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
I only want to live here.

130
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,919
Ye Hua, you don't need to worry about me.

131
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm not afraid of the fire.

132
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
I've even seen a black dragon appear.

133
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
It's really all right. You don't
have to worry about me, Ye Hua.

134
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,559
You...

135
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,720
Where's the fire?

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,480
Who are you?

137
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,919
This...

138
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,039
Don't tell me you're a monster.

139
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,519
No wonder I felt you were extraordinary
the first time I saw you.

140
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,240
You were gravely injured,
but you healed so quickly.

141
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,679
Ye Hua.

142
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,360
You aren't that...

143
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,720
The Golden Lion that
brought disaster to the people

144
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,480
and caused the emperor
to slit his own throat?

145
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,399
Su Su.

146
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,840
Why do you think I am a monster?

147
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,279
What is wrong?

148
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
Are you afraid of me?

149
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,120
Ye Hua.

150
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,720
No matter what sort of monster you are

151
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,840
since we have bowed to heaven and earth,
we are husband and wife.

152
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,440
Ye Hua, if you really are the Golden Lion

153
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,960
then you must have had a terrible fight
with that black dragon.

154
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
If the black dragon knows
you were injured but still alive

155
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
he will come back for you.

156
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,799
He knows this place well.

157
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,720
No, we must leave.

158
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,039
- Run, quickly.
- Su Su.

159
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,759
If I really am a monster,
are you still willing to follow me?

160
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,159
Ye Hua, don't say such words from now on.

161
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,519
Since I have made an oath to love you
with all my heart for all eternity

162
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,720
and will never leave you
regardless of fortune or calamity

163
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
then I will not care what you are.

164
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,559
Are you not afraid of death?

165
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,440
Death?

166
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,960
This is how I am.

167
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:36,720
I had you give yourself to me because I
wanted you to stay to keep me company.

168
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,080
But we have been together for months
and we are already husband and wife.

169
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,399
So since we are married I won't care if
you are human or monster.

170
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,320
I will be with you either way.

171
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,000
Even if you have to pay with your life
for the bad things you have done

172
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
I will follow you in death.

173
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,120
Isn't that the worst that can happen?

174
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,440
Say it again.

175
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:19,240
Here, in this world, no matter when,
no matter where

176
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,480
as long as you do not betray me,
I will never leave you.

177
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,839
Ye Hua, we should run.

178
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,039
There's no need to run.

179
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,579
I am not a monster.

180
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,400
You... aren't a monster?

181
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,279
Su Su.

182
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,759
I am just a mortal.

183
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,480
What?

184
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,720
I am just a mortal who wants to
achieve immortality through cultivation

185
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,279
and have learned some minor magic.

186
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,880
What is it?

187
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,319
Are you disappointed?

188
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

189
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,079
I had already come up with
more than a hundred ways to flee.

190
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,680
How come someone who
practices Daoism can take a wife?

191
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,359
Oh no, Father is heading to Xiwu Palace?

192
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,799
Greetings, Heavenly Lord and Dijun...

193
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,000
Is Crown Prince inside?

194
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,440
Yes.

195
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,920
Tonight is Su Jin's wedding night.

196
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,952
Everyone in the palace
is at the wedding banquet.

197
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:31,880
It is inappropriate
for him not to be there.

198
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,000
His Highness said he feels tired and
does not want to join in the festivities

199
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,839
and told us not to disturb him.

200
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,400
Go inside to report to him.
Have him wake up and greet Dijun.

201
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,680
Yes.

202
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,559
- Wait, wait! Wait.
- Impudence.

203
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,480
How is it proper for you
to be making such a ruckus

204
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,240
outside the Crown Prince's chambers?

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,880
Please forgive me, Father.
Please forgive me, Dijun.

206
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,279
I am afraid Ye Hua is currently nursing
his injuries.

207
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,319
It will be bad if he is interrupted and
his spiritual balance is disturbed.

208
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,480
His Highness only had
a fight with the Golden Lion.

209
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
He sustained severe injuries?

210
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,200
His injuries aren't severe,
nor are they light.

211
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,519
Enough.

212
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,480
A minor injury for
the Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe

213
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,223
does not need to be repeatedly mentioned.

214
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,279
- Go and call Crown Prince out here.
- Yes.

215
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,079
Ye Hua?

216
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,200
Ye Hua!

217
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,079
Ye Hua!

218
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,420
Your Highness.

219
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,839
Heavenly Lord, Dijun, Third Uncle.

220
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Ye Hua.

221
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,200
Where are you?

222
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,359
When you returned yesterday, didn't you
say you had light injuries

223
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,920
why do you look so exhausted?

224
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,200
Ever since returning from
the mortal realm

225
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,599
I have been discussing the matter of
the Mermaid Clan with Third Uncle.

226
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,319
I have neglected to sleep
and eat properly.

227
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
Very good.

228
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,559
This is what the future Heavenly Lord
should be doing.

229
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,359
- However, you must remember to rest.
- Yes.

230
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,599
Why have Heavenly Lord and Dijun
come here?

231
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,920
We are here to discuss
your marriage arrangement with Qing Qiu.

232
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,759
Your Majesty suddenly
bestowed marriage onto me.

233
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,640
In order to appease Fox King,
I did not say much.

234
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,759
Today, aside from Your Majesty and I,
only Dijun and Third Uncle are present.

235
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,839
I would like to speak freely.

236
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,319
What is it?

237
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,880
Are you unsatisfied with this engagement?

238
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,720
That is not the case.

239
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,680
Your Majesty, when I was young,
Father often told me

240
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,359
I will be succeeding the position of
Heavenly Lord.

241
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,519
And I am not like the average person.

242
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,640
When Second Uncle Sang Ji was born

243
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,160
36 rainbow birds sang
and flew circles in the sky.

244
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,960
When I was born, there were
72 rainbow birds to celebrate my arrival.

245
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,920
Your Majesty even granted me
the status of heir apparent

246
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,359
in front of the entire world.

247
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,940
In these dozens of millennia

248
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,519
I have lived with caution
daring not to make the slightest mistake

249
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,519
for fear of disappointing
Your Majesty and Father.

250
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,319
You have lived up to our expectations.

251
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,440
My goal is to be a wise ruler.

252
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,599
And not to lose myself in
the affairs of men and women.

253
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:48,559
That is why I believe being married
at this time is too soon.

254
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,839
Your Majesty, please allow me
20,000 time to gain experience.

255
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
That does sound reasonable.

256
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
Ye Hua.

257
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,079
Are those words from your heart?

258
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,559
The truth, no lies.

259
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,519
This is the first time you have
spoken up against me.

260
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,319
I have been unfilial.
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

261
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,599
Ye Hua.

262
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,279
Do you not want to marry Bai Qian of
Qing Qiu because you have a secret?

263
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,880
There is no secret.

264
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,000
In the past, the one I doted on
the most was your second uncle.

265
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yet, it was also your second uncle
who disappointed me the most.

266
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,160
Did you know this?

267
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,759
I knew.

268
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,240
I have spent dozens of millennia
of efforts on you.

269
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,720
And have been more meticulous
with you than I have been with him.

270
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
That is why I will not
allow any mistakes.

271
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,799
Especially...

272
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
in regards to women.

273
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,079
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

274
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,400
That is good.

275
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:43,160
As for the marriage with Qing Qiu,
let me think about it.

276
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,119
What do you think, Dijun?

277
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,240
It is a bit of rush.

278
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,039
The engagement was just decided.

279
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,279
If you immediately start
discussing the bridal procession

280
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm afraid it will scare Fox King
into thinking

281
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,480
Crown Prince has some
unmentionable disease

282
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,650
and is afraid Qing Qiu will
call off the engagement.

283
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,559
Oh, yes.

284
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
I heard you had shown your dragon form
in the mortal realm.

285
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,359
Why was that?

286
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Of course, it was to subdue
the Golden Lion.

287
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,640
When did I tell you to speak?

288
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,720
I had wanted to wait until the case began
to unfold before reporting to you.

289
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,279
Isn't this the artifact that Mo Yuan gave
to his precious disciple?

290
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,160
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

291
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,440
It is the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

292
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,119
I encountered Ghost Lord Li Jing
in the mortal realm.

293
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,599
This fan was in his possession.

294
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,519
In Li Jing's possession?

295
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,240
Mo Yuan's body and Si Yin
have been missing for 70,000 years.

296
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,839
How come the artifact would
end up in the Ghost Realm?

297
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,440
I found this odd as well.

298
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,195
There were some complications
in the process of retrieving this fan.

299
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:13,516
After revealing my dragon form

300
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:16,359
I returned to the Celestial Palace
and hoped to investigate this case.

301
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,680
Perhaps finding this fan will uncover
the reason for Mo Yuan's disappearance.

302
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,799
Mo Yuan is the son of Heavenly Father
and master of Kunlun Mountain.

303
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,160
He should be buried in
the Sea of Innocence.

304
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,279
This matter must be
thoroughly investigated.

305
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,200
However, since 70,000 years have passed,
there is no need to hurry.

306
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,119
- Yes.
- And also...

307
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,799
Su Jin is officially named consort today.

308
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,839
The two of you grew up together.

309
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,039
No matter what, you must
have a toast with her.

310
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,147
- Today?
- Yes.

311
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,839
Conferring the title of consort upon her

312
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,000
was to appease
the various branch leaders.

313
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,480
Now that the Mermaid Clan
has intents to rebel

314
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
a war could happen at any time.

315
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
Conferring the title of consort upon her
was only a matter of time.

316
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,680
Congratulations, Heavenly Lord.

317
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,960
Ye Hua.

318
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,960
In a little while, you will set out
with the new consort

319
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,223
on a trip back to her hometown
to worship her ancestors.

320
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,079
Worship her ancestors?

321
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,559
Worshiping her ancestors
is merely a pretense.

322
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,200
It is a show you put on
for the branch leaders.

323
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,059
You are the next Heavenly Lord.

324
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,079
You must forge a good relationship
with the various branch leaders.

325
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,400
Having Su Jin with you
will facilitate the process.

326
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,319
After all, those leaders greatly dote on
this descendant of a favored subject.

327
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,319
I understand.

328
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,119
I already had plans to meet these leaders

329
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,720
to be fully prepared for
the war against the Mermaid Clan.

330
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,839
Good.

331
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:51,440
My three sons...

332
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,240
can not compare to you, my good grandson.

333
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:21,200
Fortunately, you brought out
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun

334
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
to survive this time.

335
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,000
It was also by chance that
this fan came into my possession.

336
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,559
I can't believe it has even saved me.

337
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,359
Seeing this fan, I really am
reminded of that immortal.

338
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,519
At Ruoshui 70,000 years ago,
Si Yin and I were comrades.

339
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,599
He and Mo Yuan...

340
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,440
had a deep relationship
as master and disciple.

341
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,559
Ye Hua, let me talk to you
about something serious.

342
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,759
Please go ahead, Third Uncle.

343
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,440
How do I put this?

344
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,880
Your father will not
approve of you marrying a mortal.

345
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,839
You must consider this carefully.

346
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,160
When you are with her,
you two can only be elsewhere.

347
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,480
A day in heaven is
a year in the mortal realm.

348
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,359
Do you intend on using two months
to spend a lifetime with her?

349
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,920
No.

350
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,079
I don't merely want two months.

351
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,359
I knew you wouldn't be able
to part with her.

352
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,559
You want her to
be with you for a long time

353
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
so you have to take her away
from the mortal realm.

354
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
But, Ye Hua, you must know

355
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,200
that all the immortals of the world know
you are to marry Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

356
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,440
You must not bring her here to heaven.

357
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,240
Your second uncle's mistakes are
tragically clear for you to see.

358
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,119
I know.

359
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,880
I do feel guilty for forcing you
and Bai Qian of Qing Qiu together.

360
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,319
Now, it seems I dug the hole myself
and buried you in it.

361
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,799
Third Uncle.

362
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,599
Even without Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
there would be Qing Qian of Bai Qiu.

363
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,119
From the day I was born, I was named
the next Heavenly Lord.

364
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,960
With or without this engagement

365
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,839
Heavenly Lord would not allow me
to marry a mortal.

366
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,480
That is correct.

367
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,000
Your second uncle's snake
was lucky to leave with her life.

368
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,759
If Father were to know you have
also fallen in love with a mortal

369
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:23,144
your beloved will be put in a situation
where she can neither live nor die.

370
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,759
Let's not talk about this now.
I must return to Mount Junji.

371
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,680
You absolutely must not.

372
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,559
Father has told us to go with Su Jin
to worship her ancestors.

373
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,711
The whole palace is making preparations.
If you leave, you will be found out.

374
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,319
But Su Su does not know the situation.

375
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:44,079
I suddenly disappeared.
She must be mad with worry.

376
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,440
Anxious just like this?

377
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,319
What will she do when
she faces Heavenly Lord?

378
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,039
But...

379
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,119
Someone is here.

380
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,680
Ye Hua, how unexpected.

381
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,920
Su Jin, that little girl,
has become my father's consort.

382
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,480
I thought she would marry you.

383
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,359
Fate makes fools of all of us.

384
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,880
Ye Hua!

385
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,299
Ye Hua!

386
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,200
Ye Hua!

387
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,339
Ye Hua!

388
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,200
Your Highness.

389
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,079
Your--

390
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,680
Consort Su Jin.

391
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,200
In front of Your Highness,
I am still the same Su Jin.

392
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,359
Sit.

393
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
Is Your Highness ready to set off?

394
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,039
Heavenly Lord has told us

395
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,159
since I have nothing better to do,
I should go with you and Ye Hua.

396
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,320
Do you mind, Your Highness?

397
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,440
Your Highness wishes to go as well?

398
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,079
That's right.

399
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,760
Heavenly Lord has said

400
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,599
you are the descendant of one who
sacrificed his life for our tribe.

401
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,039
Your entire clan shed their blood
and laid their lives down for us.

402
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,360
It is only right for our royal kin
to treat you well.

403
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,239
You are also a consort now.

404
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,519
With this combination, of course
I am willing to make the trip with you.

405
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,789
Thank you, Your Highness,
for holding me in such high regard.

406
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,599
Then let's not waste time talking.
Let's make a quick trip of it.

407
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
Because it is a long journey

408
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,199
I have already obtained
Heavenly Lord's permission

409
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,199
to stay a night in
the temporary residence.

410
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,159
It's because I was afraid
the journey would be too arduous

411
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,760
and tire Your Highness.

412
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,400
Stay for a night?

413
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,079
Yes.

414
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,079
Sorry about the trouble, Your Highness.

415
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,679
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

416
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
You all are...

417
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,039
Your Highness, I really did not know

418
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,519
you came to the palace to
gather experience from Dijun.

419
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,960
I was so disrespectful to Your Highness.

420
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,000
Please do not take it to heart.

421
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,559
Allow me to apologize to Your Highness.

422
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Gather experience?

423
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,639
Yes, Dijun sent someone to
convey his orders.

424
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,320
And said Your Highness wanted to
hide your own identity

425
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,000
to come to Taichen Palace to
observe the day-to-day life of maids.

426
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And that is why you were
temporarily residing here.

427
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,599
Dijun had someone tell you that?

428
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,280
Dijun also said to take Your Highness
to pick your own quarters of your liking.

429
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,360
I'm not going elsewhere. I am fine here.

430
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,840
Your Highness, as a princess,
how can you live with us?

431
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,000
I want to live with you all.

432
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,280
That would be gathering experience.

433
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
That...

434
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,960
I'll go tell Dijun myself.

435
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,320
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness...

436
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,440
What do we do now?

437
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,760
I had thought that since I am here to
repay a debt

438
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,239
I should do it properly and temporarily
forget that I am a princess.

439
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,400
So, please allow me to
live with the palace maids.

440
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,960
If you really want to live with them,
I won't stop you.

441
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,920
Thank you, Dijun.

442
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,079
Did you really come
to Taichen Palace to repay me?

443
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,079
Yes.

444
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,480
"Even a small favor
must be repaid double."

445
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,119
So how do you plan on
repaying a life debt?

446
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,039
A life debt... by...

447
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,519
Serving tea and water?

448
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,519
I'm afraid you'll have to stay
in Taichen Palace

449
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:39,400
serving tea for 100,000 years

450
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,280
and serving water for 200,000 years
for it to be enough.

451
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,119
Then do you have a wish
that has yet to be fulfilled?

452
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,519
Yes.

453
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,960
What is it?

454
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,559
I will do everything I can
to help you fulfill it.

455
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Mo Yuan gave me this tea set
70,000 years ago.

456
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,800
In these 70,000 years, I have kept
thinking of returning him this favor.

457
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,960
Can you help me with that?

458
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,119
- Mo Yuan?
- It's a shame.

459
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,440
He has returned to seclusion
for a long time now.

460
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,559
There have been no traces of him.

461
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:24,320
Actually, Mo Yuan...

462
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,440
<i>Wait.</i>

463
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>Is Dijun trying to mislead me?</i>

464
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,599
<i>Could he already know Auntie is Si Yin?</i>

465
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,440
<i>And also know Mo Yuan is in Qing Qiu?</i>

466
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,880
When Mo Yuan disappeared,
I had just been born.

467
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,119
I don't know where he went.

468
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
Do you have any other wish?

469
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,639
A second wish?

470
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,239
Yes.

471
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,119
Please do tell.

472
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,360
Tell me how your aunt and Mo Yuan
are tied together.

473
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:10,400
Haven't I told you before?

474
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
My aunt has absolutely
no relation to Kunlun Mountain.

475
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,559
Oh, yes.

476
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,800
I had forgotten.

477
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,239
You have indeed time and again said

478
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,159
your aunt has absolutely no ties
to Kunlun Mountain.

479
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:31,280
Why are you so concerned about Mo Yuan?

480
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,039
Aside from Mo Yuan,
do you not have any other wish?

481
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,719
For someone like me who wants for nothing

482
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,960
I can't think of any other wish
at the moment.

483
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,719
Take your time. I am in no hurry.

484
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,199
Oh, yes.

485
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,000
There is one more thing.

486
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,360
Have you ever seen
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

487
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,800
What is that? The name is so strange.

488
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,719
Allow me to wash your teacup.

489
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,320
Strange. Why does Dijun keep
questioning me about Auntie and Mo Yuan?

490
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,360
What are you doing?

491
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,199
How dare you do this to me?
How presumptuous!

492
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,599
Oh no...

493
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,079
- You!
- Why didn't you greet me first?

494
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,719
You!

495
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,639
You spilled tea all over me and
you still dare to make a fuss?

496
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,800
How presumptuous of you!

497
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,719
Don't think because
you're Qing Qiu's princess

498
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,480
you can use an excuse
of repaying a kindness

499
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,800
to come and go freely from
the Celestial Palace.

500
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,239
This is not Qing Qiu. Don't think
you can do whatever you please!

501
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,480
This is the teacup Mo Yuan gave to Dijun.

502
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,159
My--

503
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
This noise is giving me a headache.

504
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,199
Greetings, Dong Hua Dijun.

505
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,000
I heard the people in Cousin's palace say

506
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,280
you and Heavenly Lord went to
Cousin's Zichen Hall at daybreak

507
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,360
to discuss Cousin's engagement
with Bai Qian.

508
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,639
That is correct.

509
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,239
Will His Highness be escorting my aunt
to the wedding ceremony?

510
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,239
That is correct.

511
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,079
Will you be going to
the wedding procession?

512
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,920
That is correct.

513
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,840
What else do you want to ask?

514
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,760
Nothing else at the moment.

515
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,960
I... I do!

516
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,079
- I want to ask--
- If there's nothing else, you may go.

517
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,079
I have to handle
Taichen Palace affairs now.

518
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,440
All right.

519
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,800
I take my leave.

520
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,639
Feng Jiu.

521
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,079
You shattered the teacup
Mo Yuan gave to me.

522
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,079
How does Your Highness
plan on counting this debt?

523
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,000
Will it be added onto the life debt?
