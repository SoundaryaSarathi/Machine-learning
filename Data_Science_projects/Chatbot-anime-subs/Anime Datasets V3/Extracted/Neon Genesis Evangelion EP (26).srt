1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,670
2016 A.D.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,750
WHAT MANKIND HAS LOST

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,260
THE HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT PROGRESSES

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,380
HOWEVER, THERE'S TOO LITTLE TIME TO DESCRIBE THE ENTIRE PROCESS

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,140
THEREFORE, WE WILL DISCUSS THE COMPLEMANTATION OF THE MIND

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,010
OF ONE SINGLE BOY NAMED SHINJI IKARI

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,310
SHINJI IKARI

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,020
FEAR

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,700
I fear that I will disappear.

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,810
But I can disappear, because I
believe I'm unworthy of existence.

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,910
Why is that?

33
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,310
Because I am worthless.

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,840
Because I am worthless.

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,240
I am unwanted, a useless child!

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,680
You don't care about me
anyway, do you?

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,210
Using that excuse is no different
than running away.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,750
What you truly fear is
failure, isn't it?

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,360
You fear that you may be
hated by others.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,690
You fear acknowledging that
weakness, even to yourself.

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,060
How can you criticize me when
you do the same thing?

42
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,030
You're right. We are all
basically the same.

43
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,860
Our minds lack something basic.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,230
We fear that deficiency.

45
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,300
We fear it.

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,730
That is why we are attempting
to become one.

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,940
That is why we are attempting
to become one.

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,140
We will meld with and
fill each other.

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,370
This is Instrumentality.

50
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,210
Mankind cannot live without being
surrounded by others.

51
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,080
Mankind cannot survive alone.

52
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,950
Although you, yourself,
are always unique.

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,780
That's why life is hard.

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,390
That's why life is sad and empty.

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,920
That's why you want affection,

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,620
the close physical and mental
presence of others.

57
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,420
That is why we wish to become one.

58
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,430
The human soul is made of weak
and fragile elements.

59
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,400
The body and mind are made of
brittle components as well.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,730
That's why,

61
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,040
via Instrumentality, Mankind must
fill and complement each other.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,790
WHY?

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,000
Must you ask? Because there
is no other way to exist.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,050
REALLY?

65
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,840
Why do you exist?

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,930
I DO NOT KNOW

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,610
Maybe I live to find out why I exist.

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,020
For whom do you exist?

69
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,180
For myself, of course.

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,930
Maybe for myself.

71
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,100
REALLY?

72
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,790
Are you happy being alive?

73
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,190
I don't know.

74
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,030
Are you happy being alive?

75
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,960
Of course I'm happy!

76
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,450
Are you happy being alive?

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,530
I don't want anything
except to be happy.

78
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,870
Do you hate being sad?

79
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,770
I don't like it.

80
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,970
Do you hate enduring pain?

81
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,810
I don't like it.

82
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,480
Is that why you run away?

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,810
Yes. Do you blame me? Why not
run from something that hurts?!

84
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,210
I mustn't run away!

85
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,520
Why mustn't you run away?

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,250
Because escaping from the
reality can be painful too.

87
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,550
Even though you're running from
something more painful?

88
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,190
I can't bear it.

89
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,440
As long as you know what the
pain is, it can be endured.

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,140
Yes, if the pain is too harsh,
you can escape it.

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,610
If you really hate it,
you can still run.

92
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,140
No, I won't! I'm tired of
running away!

93
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,620
Yes! I mustn't run away.

94
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,530
That's because you are aware that
running only brings you more pain.

95
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,590
That's because running away
can be far worse.

96
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,150
That's why you do not wish
to run away.

97
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,830
If I run away, nobody
will respect me!

98
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,340
Don't leave me alone!

99
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,630
Don't desert me, I'm begging you!

100
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,910
There he goes again, doing
whatever others tell him to.

101
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,940
That's a sad survival mechanism,
isn't it?

102
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,140
So what?! It's better than
being left all alone!

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,150
You fear being hurt.

104
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,420
You try to make yourself
believe that, don't you?

105
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,050
You're not the only one
who gets hurt, Shinji.

106
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,950
Everybody feels the pain.
You aren't the only one.

107
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,690
It's just easier for you to think
that's true, isn't it?

108
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,460
Shut up! I don't care!

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Why should I? Nobody
cares about me!

110
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,630
Once again, you've abandoned
all sense of self-worth.

111
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,440
I have nothing.

112
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,200
There you go again, saying that
you have no worth at all.

113
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,440
Do you believe that by not
expecting anything

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,310
you won't get hurt either?

115
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,810
Is that how you sustain
your pathetic ego,

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,610
by asking others to praise you?

117
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,820
Nobody accepts me.

118
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,050
That's not true. You just
believe it to be true.

119
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,890
That's why I must pilot Eva.

120
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,630
That's your point of view. You've
been trying to convince yourself

121
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,500
that you're worthless since
the beginning.

122
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
I have to! I have to do it!

123
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,100
Not true, you don't have to.

124
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,690
No, you just believe that you must.

125
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,330
No, you're wrong! My life
is pointless otherwise!

126
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,340
I have nothing else to be proud of.

127
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,930
That's why you pilot an Eva?

128
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,170
Piloting Eva gives me an
identity, a purpose.

129
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,800
Piloting Eva gives me an
identity, a purpose.

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,570
I had no value before
I became a pilot.

131
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,520
The fact that I pilot an Eva justifies
my presence here.

132
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,180
I have no other value.

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,820
I have no other value.

134
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,260
I have no other value.
No other value at all.

135
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,560
A REASON TO EXIST

136
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,970
I perceive no value in myself.

137
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,470
THEREFORE...

138
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,930
I hate myself!

139
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,080
You idiot! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,310
I hate you!

141
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,710
I hate everything about you!

142
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,220
I'm sorry, but I hate you.

143
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,150
I hate you!

144
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,720
I hate you!
I hate you!

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
I hate you!

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,650
I hate you!
I hate you!

147
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,590
I hate you!

148
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:12,790
I hate everything about you!

149
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,690
I hate everything about you!

150
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,090
I hate you!

151
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,720
I hate you!

152
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,700
See? Everyone hates me.

153
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,400
Every person in existence
must hate me.

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,370
No, that's just what you imagine.

155
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,610
Yes, that must be it!
Because I hate myself!

156
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,950
Because you hate yourself,
no one respects you.

157
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,110
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate everything!

158
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
But they're nice to me.

159
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,640
When I pilot the Eva,
they treat me well.

160
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,480
They act as if they like me.

161
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,570
SO YOU'RE HAPPY

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
Other people were being nice to me!

163
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,570
STILL NOT HAPPY

164
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,550
Which are your true feelings?

165
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,900
I don't know...

166
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,540
Perhaps, both are my true feelings.

167
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,160
So, that's why you pilot Eva?

168
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,940
I have no choice. I only
have the Eva.

169
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,010
Otherwise, you could not
retain your own identity.

170
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,680
In fact, Eva Unit 01 is a part of
yourself, your sense of being.

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,210
If you depend only on the Eva,

172
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,520
then the Eva will become
your only identifier.

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,490
Eva will become your only value.

174
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,160
You, the real you, will be
erased from existence.

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,030
I don't care! I had no other value
to start with anyway!

176
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,300
I was learning to play the cello,
but that didn't help me either!

177
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,930
You just didn't discipline yourself.

178
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,370
But now that I can pilot the Eva,
I must be able to...

179
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,170
No, you may lose your
identity, as I have.

180
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,900
You may lose Eva and
your self-worth.

181
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,410
WHY DO YOU PILOT EVA?

182
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,740
I pilot it because it
is all I can do.

183
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,660
Finale
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

184
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,790
Rain...

185
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,280
Dark shadows of gloom
hang above me.

186
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,520
That's how I feel. This isn't
how I wish it to be.

187
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,360
The setting sun,
the ending of life.

188
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,890
This is not how I wish it to be.

189
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,300
Morning...

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,870
The beginning of a day.

191
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,410
The beginning of another
terrible day.

192
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,340
This is not how I wish it was.

193
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,830
Blue sky...

194
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,140
Something warm...

195
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,780
Something unfamiliar...

196
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,110
Something that fills me with horror.

197
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,520
I don't want this.

198
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't want it to be this way.

199
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Everything! Everything!
I hate everything!

200
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,790
What do you wish?

201
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,750
ARE YOU AFRAID OF FEAR?

202
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,410
What do you desire?

203
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
DO YOU WISH FOR SERENITY?

204
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,250
What do you want?

205
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,000
LIKE ME!

206
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,890
Don't hate me, please!

207
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,380
What I fear is...

208
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,130
REJECTION

209
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,590
What I want is...

210
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,720
CONTACT AND ACCEPTANCE

211
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,100
Can I stay next to you?

212
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,870
May I stay here?

213
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,720
Do you like me?

214
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,930
YOUR MOTHER...

215
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,100
DO YOU LOVE HER?

216
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,010
Do you want to be with
your real mother?

217
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,380
No, I don't.

218
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,750
Do you want to be with your father?

219
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,650
No, I don't.

220
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,230
Why not?

221
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,320
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID

222
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,420
I'm afraid of being hated.

223
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,910
My identity might start to disappear.

224
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,820
THAT'S WHY?

225
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,530
What is it that you wish?

226
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,560
ENDING THE FEAR

227
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,370
What is it that you want?

228
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,410
ENDING THE LONELINESS

229
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,160
You're very insecure, aren't you?

230
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,930
To become secure, I have to have...

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,900
Value! I want to be worth
something!

232
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,340
I want to be worth enough to
attract the attention of others!

233
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,680
I NEED A REASON TO EXIST

234
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,970
That is something you have
to find for yourself.

235
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,390
You have to find your own
value for yourself.

236
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,810
THAT'S WHY I PILOT EVA

237
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,520
I have no value without it.

238
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,720
My life is worthless without it.

239
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,650
Then, what are you?

240
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,710
Then, what am I?

241
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,980
What am I?!

242
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,660
This is... Me!

243
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,960
This is the Shape that lets others
recognize me as myself.

244
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,570
It is my symbol for my Self.

245
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,880
This is... This is...

246
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,450
SHINJI IKARI

247
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,470
A representation. Everything is a
description, not my real Self.

248
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,840
Everything's a shape, an identifier
to let others recognize me as me.

249
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,400
But then, what am I?

250
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,340
WHERE AM I?

251
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,180
Is this me?

252
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,720
My true Self? My fake Self?

253
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,480
You are you.

254
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,950
There is little difference between
how you interpret yourself

255
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,360
and how others interpret you.

256
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
Right.

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,960
My clothes... My shoes... My room...

258
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,730
These all are parts of what
makes up my Self.

259
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,460
These things are connected through
your consciousness.

260
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,360
So, what I think is me, is me.

261
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,230
What I recognize as Self is myself.

262
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,670
But I don't understand my Self.

263
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,180
Where am I?

264
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,670
What am I?

265
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,700
What am I?

266
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,750
THAT'S WHY YOU CLOSE YOUR SOUL

267
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,810
Nobody understands me!

268
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,650
What are you, stupid? Of course
nobody understands you!

269
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,050
Nobody can ever understand you.

270
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,190
The only one who can
take care of you

271
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,560
and understand you
is you, yourself.

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,830
So, you must take care of yourself.

273
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,970
But I still don't understand my Self!

274
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,640
I don't even know what it is
that makes me myself!

275
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,070
How could I love myself?!

276
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,280
HE IS INSECURE

277
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,740
You are still unstable.

278
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,350
That is, the present you.

279
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,010
And the people around
the present you.

280
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,480
And the environment that surrounds
the present you.

281
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,390
None of these last forever.

282
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,690
Time continues to flow,
and time brings change.

283
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,720
Your world is in a state
of constant change.

284
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,960
You are capable of change anytime.
Your Mind perceives these changes.

285
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,630
What is this?

286
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,370
A world of nothing?

287
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,240
A world with nobody in it?

288
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,110
This is the world of perfect freedom.

289
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,770
Freedom?

290
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,710
A world of perfect freedom, a world
in which you have no restrictions.

291
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,280
Is this really freedom?

292
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Yes, this is what it is.

293
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,220
However, this world
has nothing in it.

294
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,990
Unless I do something?

295
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,760
Right, unless you do or
think of something.

296
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,220
But...

297
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,360
I don't know what to do or think!

298
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,560
He is uncertain.

299
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,600
He has no image of Self
to orient himself.

300
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
There's nothing solid here.

301
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
It is a world in which there
are no obstacles.

302
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,880
THIS IS FREEDOM

303
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
This is a world in which you can
do anything you wish.

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,830
But you're afraid, aren't you?

305
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,010
Don't you know what it is
that you want to do?

306
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,640
What should I do?

307
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,250
Let me give you a restriction.

308
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,650
There! Now, you have
top and bottom.

309
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,850
But you've lost a degree
of your freedom.

310
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,550
Now you must stand on the ground.

311
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,020
But now you feel easier, don't you?

312
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,660
You have less to trouble your mind.

313
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,190
And now, you can walk.

314
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,200
This is happening because
you will it to be.

315
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,470
Is this my will?

316
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,550
This world with the floor is the
only thing around yourself.

317
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,490
But now, you can move around
anywhere you wish to within it.

318
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,620
You could even turn the world
upside down, if you wanted to.

319
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,660
And the position of your world
is not the same either.

320
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,660
It changes with the passage of time.

321
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,130
You can change yourself as well.

322
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,500
What forms your shape is your mind

323
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,730
and its interaction with the world
that surrounds you.

324
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,010
You can do anything here,
because this is your world.

325
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,110
This is the shape of your reality.

326
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,280
THIS IS THE REALITY

327
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,810
What is this?

328
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,680
An empty space.

329
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,170
An empty world.

330
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,740
A world where nothing
exists but myself.

331
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,390
With only myself, I have nothing
to interact with.

332
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,960
It's as if I'm here, but
not here at all.

333
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,290
It's as if I'm slowly fading
out of existence.

334
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,130
WHY?

335
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,970
Because only you are here.

336
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,670
Only myself?

337
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,870
Without others to interact with,

338
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,740
you cannot truly recognize
your own image.

339
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,930
My own image?

340
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,310
MY IMAGE?

341
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,040
Yes. In the act of observing others,
you may recognize yourself.

342
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,680
Your image of yourself is restrained

343
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,150
by having to observe the barriers
between yourself and others.

344
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,060
And yet, you can not see yourself
without the presence of others.

345
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,160
When there are others, I can
perceive myself as an individual.

346
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,920
If I am alone, then I will be the
same as everything else.

347
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
There will be no difference between
myself and nothing!

348
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,800
By recognizing the differences
between yourself and others,

349
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,670
you establish your identity
as yourself.

350
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,370
The very first other person
is your mother.

351
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,680
Your mother is a different individual.

352
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,910
Right, I am me and she is she!

353
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,320
But are you really sure that
others form my Self?

354
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,550
It's true, Shinji Ikari.

355
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,220
Man, has it taken you this long
to realize that simple fact?!

356
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,710
Shinji, you idiot!

357
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,920
It's about time you got up.
Shinji, you idiot.

358
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,290
What is it, Asuka?

359
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,570
What the hell does that mean?!

360
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,440
Can't you appreciate the fact

361
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
that I went to the trouble of
coming to wake you up?

362
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,740
I don't hear any words of gratitude
for your oldest childhood friend?!

363
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,510
Thanks...

364
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,610
But let me sleep a little longer.

365
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,520
What are you doing?

366
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,640
It's time for you to get up!

367
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,960
You stupid pervert! I can't believe
you've got one of those!

368
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,660
I can't help it! It's morning!

369
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,740
That Shinji! Asuka's so sweet to
come pick him up every morning,

370
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,230
and he doesn't appreciate it.

371
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,810
Dear, you have to get ready too.

372
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,780
Gosh, you're just like Shinji.

373
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,350
Are you ready?

374
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,290
Anytime.

375
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,360
I'm the one who gets complaints
from Professor Fuyutsuki

376
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
if you're late for the meeting.

377
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,060
That's true. He's your biggest fan.

378
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,120
Oh, you! Cut that out and get ready.

379
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,530
I understand, Yui.

380
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,300
Hurry up!

381
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,210
I know! You're such a pain in
the ass sometimes, Asuka!

382
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,680
What did you say?!

383
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,370
We're leaving now!

384
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm leaving.

385
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,010
See you later, Sweetie!

386
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,910
Come on, Dear! Put the
newspaper down!

387
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,580
I understand, Yui.

388
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,230
Hey, isn't there a new student
starting today?

389
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,270
That's right!

390
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,900
Since this city's going to become
the new capital,

391
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,910
there're a lot of people moving in.

392
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,870
It's no wonder we're getting
so many new kids.

393
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,680
Oh, that makes sense. I wonder
what she's like?

394
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,340
I hope she's cute!

395
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,220
Oh, I'm late! I'm late!

396
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,410
I can't be late for the first day!

397
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,430
I'm sorry! I'm in a hurry!

398
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,060
I'm really very sorry!

399
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,580
What?!

400
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,840
Did you see her panties?!

401
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,640
Well, it wasn't really a good look.

402
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,700
Just a little flash.

403
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,710
I can't believe that you're the
one who has all the luck!

404
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,290
Why'd you do that for, Class Rep?!

405
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,090
Suzuhara, just exactly what
were you talking about?!

406
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,430
Go change the water in the flower
vase right now! You understand?

407
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,170
You're so mean.

408
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,630
What did you just say?!

409
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,190
Poor Toji's so hen-pecked.
It's sad, isn't it?

410
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,510
Look who's talking.

411
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,940
Are you saying that I'm
easily manipulated?

412
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,380
I'm merely reporting the facts.

413
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,510
How so?

414
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,880
It just is. Accept it.

415
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,080
It just is. Accept it.

416
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,650
Why do you treat me like this?!

417
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:35,920
The calm, peace and tranquility...

418
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,350
Hey, that hurts, you idiot!
The calm, peace and tranquility...

419
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,880
It's Miss Misato, our teacher!

420
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,360
Miss Misato's so gorgeous!

421
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,100
Just look at those three stupid
stooges! Have they no shame?

422
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,010
Stand up! Bow!

423
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,480
Sit down!

424
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,750
Listen up, dudes!

425
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,220
We've got a new blue-haired babe
here to introduce herself!

426
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,190
My name's Rei Ayanami!
Nice to meet you!

427
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,390
You're the jerk who was
staring at my panties!

428
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,700
Hey, what do you mean by that?!

429
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,830
You're the one who was
flashing them at Shinji!

430
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,100
Who are you and why are
you defending him?

431
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,760
Are you guys doing it?

432
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,210
No! We're just really good
childhood friends!

433
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,640
You shut up!

434
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,040
Be quiet, you two! We're
in a class, not a bar!

435
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,950
Hey, this is more entertaining
than class!

436
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,910
I want to see how this turns out.

437
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,400
Please continue!

438
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,490
I see, this is another possibility.

439
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,130
Another possible world.

440
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,800
This current Self is the same way,
it's not my true Self.

441
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,730
I can be any way I wish to be.

442
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,870
I see, I can exist without being
an Eva pilot as well!

443
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,610
If you consider that, perhaps
this world isn't so bad.

444
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,350
Still, even though the reality
itself might not be bad,

445
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,840
I could still hate myself.

446
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
It's your mind which takes
reality and separates it

447
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,550
into what's bad and hateful.

448
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,960
It is only the mind which separates
reality from truth.

449
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,860
Your view of reality changes your
perception of its nature.

450
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,500
It is all, literally, a matter
of perspective.

451
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,100
There are as many truths
as there are people.

452
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,430
But there's only one truth
that is your truth.

453
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,840
That's the one that's formed

454
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,740
by whatever narrow point of view
you choose to view it from.

455
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,410
It's a perception that protects
you from the twisted truth.

456
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,140
That's true, and one can have a
perspective that is far too small.

457
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,120
But a person can only see things
from the perspective they choose.

458
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,320
One must learn to judge all things
via the perceived truths

459
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,120
that one receives from others.

460
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,790
For example, sunny days
make you feel good.

461
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,790
Rainy days make you feel gloomy.

462
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,690
If you are told this is so, that is
what you will believe to be so.

463
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,060
But you can have fun on a
rainy day as well.

464
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,970
Your truth can be changed simply
by the way you accept it.

465
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,130
That's how fragile the truth
for a human is.

466
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,740
A person's truth is so simple
that most ignore it

467
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,280
to concentrate on what they
think are deeper truths.

468
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,620
You, for example, are simply unused
to what it is to be liked.

469
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,020
You've never learned how

470
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,990
to deal with the fear of how others
feel about you, so you avoid it.

471
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,890
But don't others hate me?

472
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,450
What are you, stupid? It's
all in your imagination!

473
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,090
But I hate myself.

474
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,100
One who truly hates himself
cannot love.

475
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,160
He cannot place his
trust in another.

476
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,810
I'm a coward.

477
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,070
I'm cowardly, sneaky and weak.

478
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,650
Now that you know yourself, you
can take care of yourself.

479
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,980
I hate myself.

480
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,120
But I could love myself.

481
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,380
Maybe my life could have
a greater value.

482
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,860
That's right! I am no more
or less than myself!

483
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,860
I am me!

484
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,130
I want to be myself!

485
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,370
I want to continue existing
in this world!

486
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,500
I am worth living here!

487
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,290
Congratulations!

488
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,620
Congratulations!

489
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,790
Congratulations!

490
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,230
Congratulations!

491
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,260
Congratulations!

492
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Congratulations!

493
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,630
Congratulations!

494
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,120
Congratulations!

495
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,630
Congratulations!

496
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,870
Congratulations!

497
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,140
Congratulations!

498
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,570
Congratulations!

499
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,800
Congratulations!

500
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,430
Thank you all!

501
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,850
THANK YOU, FATHER

502
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,380
FAREWELL, MOTHER

503
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,360
AND TO ALL CHILDREN,

504
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,610
CONGRATULATIONS!
