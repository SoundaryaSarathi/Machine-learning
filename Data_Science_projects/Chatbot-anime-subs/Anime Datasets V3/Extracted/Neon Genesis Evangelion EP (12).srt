Standing there smiling serenely.

A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

Episode 12
The Value of a Miracle is...

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,520
Thanks, Shinji, you really saved
us from that rainstorm.

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,650
Where's Misato?

28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,390
I guess she must still be asleep.

29
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,320
She's been working all
night recently.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,050
That's right, she has a tough job.

31
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,180
We've got to be quiet.
Don't wake her up.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,700
What are you doing in here?!

33
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,740
Taking shelter from the rain.

34
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,970
You guys are after me, aren't you?

35
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,810
Well, I'm changing and if
you peep, I'll kill you!

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,770
Shut up, idiot!

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,180
Who would want to see you
changing clothes?!

38
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,050
She's way too self-conscious.

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,860
Sorry for disturbing you!

40
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,880
Hi, how's it going?

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,430
Shinji, don't be late tonight, we're
having a harmonics test.

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,500
Right.

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,230
Did you hear that, Asuka?

44
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,720
Yes, Ma'am!

45
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,310
Congratulations on
your promotion!

46
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,310
Congratulations!

47
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,510
Thank you.

48
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,340
You're most welcome.

49
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,470
See you later.

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,310
See you!

51
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,690
What's up? Did something
happen to Misato?

52
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,620
Didn't you see her badge?

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,490
The number of lines
increased to two.

54
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,660
That means that she's been
promoted from Captain to Major.

55
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,650
Really? I didn't notice that.

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,270
Yeah, I wonder when...

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,560
Are you serious? What a
bunch of dweebs!

58
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,030
Haven't you got any sympathy?

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,240
Don't you know how hard it is to
foster two jr. High kids at her age?

60
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,310
We're the only ones who have
some human compassion.

61
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,130
Units 00 and 02 are both on the
edge of the contamination zone.

62
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,160
They've reached their limit.

63
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,470
Unit 01 can still tolerate a little
more though, can't he?

64
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,200
Lower the graph depth
another 0.3.

65
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,540
He's almost reached the
contamination zone.

66
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,650
And he's still getting these
readings? He's wonderful.

67
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,220
His harmonics and sync ratio are
rapidly catching up with Asuka's.

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,450
It is a talent, isn't it?

69
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,510
He was born to pilot an
Eva, wasn't he?

70
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,990
Not that he wants to.

71
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,630
I know he's not happy.

72
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,330
Test completed. Good work.

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,100
Excellent work, Shinji.

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,370
What do you mean?

75
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,310
Your harmonics value increased
by eight points since the last test.

76
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,580
That's very good.

77
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,250
But still it's fifty points
lower than mine!

78
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,310
Yes, but he increased it by eight
points in only ten days.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,320
That's really something.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,910
It's not so great!

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,350
Are you happy with
your little praise?

82
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,310
I'm going home now! Idiot!

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,930
<i>...and here's a message for</i>
<i>"Mr. Waaa" of Tokyo-2.</i>

Yes.

Thanks, guys!

103
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,940
Thank you, Mister Suzuhara.

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,880
No, no. This wasn't my brainchild,
it was this guy right here.

105
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,610
That's right! I, Kensuke Aida
was the planner!

106
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,350
Thank you, Mister Aida.

107
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,750
Oh, you're welcome! But it's
not such a big deal, really.

108
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,260
By the way, why is the
class rep here?

109
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,120
Because I invited her.

110
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,890
Right?

111
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,000
Rei too?

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,900
Yes, I invited her,

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,530
but that girl is one
strange customer.

114
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,070
Darn, why is Mister Kaji so late?

115
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,770
Oh, is Mister Kaji that
really cool guy?

116
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,170
Oh, yeah!

117
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,780
He's so much better than these
dweebs that it's like night and day.

118
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,140
It's an insult to compare
him to them.

119
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,810
What did you say?!

120
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,110
How dare you?

121
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,720
Is it still difficult for you to be here

122
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,080
in this kind of situation?

123
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm okay.

124
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm just not used to being with

125
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,450
so many people.

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,090
Why do they have to

127
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,920
make so much noise like that?

128
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,030
Your promotion...

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,900
That means someone noticed the
work you've been doing, right?

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,240
Yeah, I suppose.

131
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,760
That's why they're happy.

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,110
But you don't look very
happy at all.

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,340
Oh, I'm happy. I am.

134
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,880
But that's not the reason
I work here.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,290
Then why did you join NERV?

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,950
Well, I don't remember. It's been
a long time since then.

137
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,030
That's got to be Kaji!

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,100
I came directly from HQ. We just
happened to meet on the way.

139
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,240
That's rather suspicious.

140
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,640
Hey, are you jealous?

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Absolutely not.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,510
Anyhow, I'd like to give you my
fondest regards, Major Katsuragi.

143
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,850
I suppose I'll have to be polite
to you from now on.

144
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,820
What are you trying
to say, you jerk?

145
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,090
It's unprecedented for both the
Commander and Vice-Commander

146
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,860
to leave Japan together.

147
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,260
I guess they must really count
on old Katsuragi here.

148
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,300
My father's not here?

149
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,920
Commander Ikari is at the South
Pole at the moment.

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,200
Nothing living can exist in the
world of death we call Antarctica.

151
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,110
Or should I simply call it Hell?

152
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,210
Nevertheless, we,
Mankind, are here.

153
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,420
We're living things,
and we're alive.

154
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,880
That's because we're under
the protection of science.

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,490
Science is the power of Man.

156
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,120
That arrogance is what caused the
tragedy of fifteen years ago,

157
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,280
the Second Impact.

158
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,890
And here is the end result.

159
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,360
This is a greater punishment
than we deserve.

160
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,570
This is the real Dead Sea.

161
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,370
Yet this is a world that has been
purified, purged of the original sin.

162
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,440
I'd rather live in a world where
people can live,

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,990
no matter how stained with sin.

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,050
The Angel appeared suddenly,
two minutes ago.

168
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,250
<i>Send Search Satellite</i>
<i>Number 6 to that orbit.</i>

169
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,950
<i>T-minus two minutes to contact.</i>

170
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,620
The target has been sighted.

171
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,230
That's impressive.

172
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,300
I don't believe it.

173
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,230
Satellite Number 6 is closing
for contact with the target.

174
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,140
<i>Start data search.</i>

175
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,800
<i>Data transmission commencing.</i>

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,800
<i>Reception confirmed.</i>

177
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,580
Was that an AT Field?

178
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,310
It's a new way of using it.

179
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,590
What incredibly destructive power.

180
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,690
That's an AT Field!

181
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,190
It uses kinetic energy too.

182
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,030
This Angel is, itself,
like a huge bomb.

183
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,460
In any case, the first blast missed
its target and hit the Pacific.

184
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,730
Two hours later, the second
shot struck there.

185
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,220
Since then, it has been steadily
correcting the error ratio.

186
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,010
That means it's learning.

187
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,630
An N2 air bomb had
no effect on it.

188
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,110
The Angel has been missing
since then.

189
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,850
It's probably coming here.

190
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,310
Yes, and next time it
may drop itself.

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,120
So, that will give us a
third Ashinoko lake?

192
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,320
All five Fuji lakes will be fused into
a single body linked to the Pacific,

193
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,890
destroying this Headquarters
in the process.

194
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,190
Can we reach the Commander?

195
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,460
It's impossible due to the Angel's
powerful jamming.

196
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,030
What is the Magi's judgment?

197
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,560
They unanimously agree in
recommending evacuation.

198
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,770
What will you do?

199
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,210
You're the one who's in
charge of all this now.

200
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,140
Notify all of the ministries
concerned

201
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,610
of this D-17 Declaration as
provided for by NERV's authority.

202
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,010
All residents within radius of
50km are to evacuate immediately.

203
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,850
Also, ask Matsushiro to
backup the Magi.

204
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,690
Are we going to evacuate as well?

205
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,850
No, but it's not necessary to
place everyone at risk.

206
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,230
<i>A D-17 Special Declaration has</i>
<i>been made by the government.</i>

207
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,260
<i>All residents must evacuate to</i>
<i>their designated locations.</i>

208
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,530
<i>Beginning with the 6th</i>
<i>and 7th blocks,</i>

209
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,060
<i>move according to your district</i>
<i>chief's direction immediately.</i>

210
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,970
<i>The evacuation of the</i>
<i>city is complete.</i>

211
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,210
<i>The evacuation of noncombatant</i>
<i>and D Class personnel</i>

212
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,680
<i>by Alarm C has been completed.</i>

213
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,150
Are you serious?

214
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,950
Yes, I am.

215
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,590
You'll risk all three Evas with your
irresponsible selfishness?

216
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,650
The chance of success is
only 0.00001%!

217
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,820
That's not even one in
ten thousand!

218
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,870
It's not zero. I just trust the Evas.

219
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,470
Major Katsuragi!

220
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,270
I'm in charge.

221
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,210
I have to do what I have to do,

222
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,310
and destroying Angels is my duty.

223
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,210
Your duty? You must be kidding.

224
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,780
This is for your own sake, isn't it?

225
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,980
This is just your revenge
against the Angels!

226
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,400
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

227
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,310
Catch it in our hands?

228
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,310
That's right. We'll position the
Evas in the estimated drop zone.

229
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,410
You'll catch it while maintaining
your AT Fields at full strength.

230
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,580
What if the Angel doesn't come
down where you expect it to?

231
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,050
We'll be a little put out.

232
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,490
What if the Evas aren't able to
withstand the shock?

233
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,220
We'll be put out in that case too.

234
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,320
What's our probability of success?

235
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,690
God only knows. I have no idea.

236
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,600
If we succeed, it'll be a miracle.

237
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,570
It's not until we've done all we can to
cause a miracle that it becomes viable.

238
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,170
You mean, we've got to be willing
to sacrifice ourselves?

239
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,170
I'm sorry, but we have no other
options for this operation.

240
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,680
How can you call this
an operation?!

241
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,950
No, you can't really call it that.

242
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,970
You can refuse to do it,
if you wish.

243
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,180
So, are you okay with this?

244
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,390
Regulations say you're supposed
to write a will. Have you done so?

245
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,360
I don't need to. I'm not
going to die just yet.

246
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
Neither do I. There is no use for it.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,230
Not me, either.

248
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,970
Again, I'm sorry.

249
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,940
But once this is over, I'll treat
you all to a steak dinner.

250
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,170
What? Really?

251
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,440
I promise.
What? Really?

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,270
I promise.
<i> </i>

253
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,670
I promise.
Yeah!

254
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,470
Yeah!

255
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,770
Don't forget!
Yeah!

256
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,940
Don't forget!
<i> </i>

257
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,430
You can count on it.

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,190
I guess she thinks a steak dinner
is supposed to impress us.

259
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,690
Does she really think a steak
dinner will impress us?

260
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,530
The Second Impact generation
has really cheap standards.

261
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,200
She can't help it.

262
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,330
What was with that fake
cheer you made?

263
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,470
I just wanted to make her feel
a little easier about it.

264
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,140
Now, since she's going to treat us,

265
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,340
I'd better figure out where to go.

266
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,610
You've got to join us this time.

267
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,280
No, I won't.

268
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,770
Why not?

269
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,250
I dislike meat.

270
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,720
Because of the Angel's ECM
jamming, we've lost track of it.

271
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,760
Since it's impossible to calculate
the collision point exactly,

272
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
the Magi's estimated a drop
zone based on the data

273
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,400
that had been collected
before it was lost.

274
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,500
This is it.

275
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,900
The range is this wide?
This is it.

276
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,970
The range is this wide?
<i> </i>

277
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,240
The distance from one side
to the other is enormous.

278
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,170
Given the size of the
target's AT Field,

279
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,880
it could totally annihilate HQ by
hitting any of these locations.

280
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,610
Given that, we'll disperse the Evas
at each of these three points.

281
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,310
And on what grounds is
this dispersal based?

282
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,180
Intuition.

283
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,320
Intuition?
Intuition.

284
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,290
Yes, a woman's intuition.

285
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,720
How sloppy! Our miracle is getting
farther and farther away.

286
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,320
Misato has never won the lottery.

287
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,300
Say...

288
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,070
What?
Say...

289
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,870
What?
<i> </i>

290
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,970
Asuka, why do you pilot an Eva?

291
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,110
To exhibit my talent to the
world, of course.

292
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,610
You mean to prove that you exist?

293
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,300
Yeah, more or less.

294
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,970
You're not going to ask her?

295
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,740
I've asked Ayanami before.

296
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,320
My, how intimate the
two of you are.

297
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,090
It's not like that.

298
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,850
Now, what about you, Shinji?

299
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,030
I don't know.

300
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,860
You don't know?
What are you, stupid?

301
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,920
Maybe I am.

302
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,790
I suppose you really are.

303
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,460
<i>Twenty minutes to estimated</i>
<i>time of impact.</i>

304
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,580
You must all evacuate now.

305
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,480
I can take care of this myself.

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,980
No, this is our job as well.

307
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,610
That's right. We can't let the kids
risk their lives by themselves.

308
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,090
They'll be fine.

309
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,820
No matter how badly the Evas
might be damaged,

310
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,290
their AT Fields will protect them.

311
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,590
Inside an Eva is the
safest place to be.

312
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,300
Shinji, yesterday you asked
me why I joined NERV.

313
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,980
My father was a man who
lived for his research,

314
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,610
for his dreams, to the
exclusion of all else.

315
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,270
I could never forgive him for that.

316
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,440
In fact, I even hated him.

317
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,380
Just like my father.

318
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,750
He never took care of me,
my mother or the family.

319
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,700
His friends always said he was
very sensitive and delicate.

320
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,930
But the truth was that he was
just a weak person

321
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,100
who didn't want to face reality,
the reality called his family.

322
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,940
He was like a kid.

323
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,970
So I agreed with my mother when
she decided to divorce him,

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,480
because she was always crying.

325
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,580
He was depressed about it,

326
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,020
but I laughed at him because
he deserved what he got.

327
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,150
But he sacrificed himself

328
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,490
to save my life during
the Second Impact.

329
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,470
Then, I didn't know whether
I hated him or loved him.

330
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,470
The only thing that
was clear to me

331
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,300
was I wanted to destroy the Angels
who caused the Second Impact.

332
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,110
So, in order to do that,
I joined NERV.

333
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,270
It might be that I still hate him,
and just want to avenge my father,

334
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,110
so that I can free myself of him.

335
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,110
<i>I mustn't run away. I mustn't run</i>
<i>away. I mustn't run away.</i>

336
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,720
Right!

337
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,210
I must NOT run away.

338
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
The Target has been sighted
at maximum magnification.

339
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,990
Distance is approximately 25,000.

340
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,480
Here it is.

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,930
All Evas, start your engines.

342
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,910
<i>All we have is a rough estimated</i>
<i>trajectory from optical sightings.</i>

343
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,180
<i>So the Magi will guide you until</i>
<i>the distance is 10,000 meters.</i>

344
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,950
<i>After that, you'll have to use</i>
<i>your own judgment.</i>

345
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>I'm placing my trust in you.</i>

346
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,450
The Angel is approaching,
distance 20,000.

347
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,660
Commence operation.

348
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,150
Here we go!

349
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,280
Start!

350
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,330
Distance 12,000!

351
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,140
AT Field, full spread!

352
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,080
Unit 02! Spread your field!

353
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,570
I'm doing it!

354
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,370
Do it now!

355
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,890
Our wireless communications
have been restored.

356
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,120
We're receiving a message from
Commander Ikari in Antarctica.

357
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Connect him here.

358
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes, Ma'am.
Connect him here.

359
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,590
Yes, Ma'am.

360
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,870
I'm very sorry, Sir.

361
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,570
My irresponsible judgment, has
caused Unit 01 to incur damage.

362
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,370
It was completely my fault.

363
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,910
<i>That is not a problem. Destroying</i>
<i>Angels is the Evas' purpose.</i>

364
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,650
<i>It was fortunate that the amount</i>
<i>of damage was minimal.</i>

365
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,780
<i>Excellent work, Major Katsuragi.</i>

366
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,980
Thank you, Sir.

367
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,320
<i>And on that subject, is the</i>
<i>pilot of Unit 01 there?</i>

368
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,520
Yes!

369
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,690
<i>I've received the report.</i>
<i>Good work, Shinji.</i>

370
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,100
Right!

371
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>Now, Major Katsuragi, I'll leave</i>
<i>the rest of this in your hands.</i>

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,490
Yes, Sir.

373
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,610
<i>Next station is New Miyanoshita,</i>
<i>New Miyanoshita.</i>

374
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,980
<i>The exit will switch to the left</i>
<i>side at the next station.</i>

375
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,520
Now, you're going to have
to fulfill your promise.

376
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,850
Of course!

377
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,490
I've withdrawn enough I can even
pay for a full French dinner.

378
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,950
Although, before payday
comes along again...

379
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,730
Take it easy, we know
how poor you are.

380
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,860
This'll be fine.

381
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,930
And even Wonder Girl says she'll
join us for ramen noodles.

382
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,070
I'll have a garlic ramen
with no roast pork.

383
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll have shark-fin soup ramen
with roast pork. Large!

384
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,370
There you go!

385
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,610
Say, Misato?

386
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,980
What?

387
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,950
When I heard my father's
words today,

388
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,820
I think I finally understood

389
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,680
the good part of being
praised by someone.

390
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,420
And I also realized

391
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,660
that the reason I pilot my Eva is
to hear those words from him.

392
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,330
That's why you're a pilot?

393
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,790
You really are an idiot.

394
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>To be continued...</i>

395
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Preview

396
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
After a simulated plug activation

397
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
trouble occurs, and Central Dogma is invaded.

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,900
NERV is forced to accept a course of self-destruction.

399
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,300
Next Episode:
"Angel Invades"

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,600
