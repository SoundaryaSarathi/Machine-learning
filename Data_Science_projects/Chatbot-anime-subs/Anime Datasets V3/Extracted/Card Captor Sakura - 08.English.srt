1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,514
This dream.

2
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,052
I’ve had it before.

3
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,588
Who is it?

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,625
It’s not me.

5
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,203
Hey, Sakura. What’s wrong?

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,545
Hey, Sakura.

7
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,745
Sakura?

8
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,152
Sakura?

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,288
Sakura…

10
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,825
I was just worried because
you were having a nightmare.

11
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,226
Sorry, sorry. I just had a strange dream.

12
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:09,802
A strange dream?

13
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,767
I’ve had it before.

14
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,304
A dream about Tokyo Tower at night.

15
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,174
And then,

16
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,873
a boy wearing Chinese clothing appeared.

17
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,338
Chinese clothing?

18
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,776
Big brother.

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,221
Weren’t you having a nightmare?

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,053
I thought I heard

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,123
Your voice.

22
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,525
Brother…

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,762
It’s nothing,
I just had a strange dream.

24
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,336
I see.

25
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,539
It was just the moaning
of a monster after all.

26
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,374
What?!

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,105
Geeze.

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,435
I’m all stiff.

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,017
What is it?

30
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,014
Breakfast is ready, so hurry down.

31
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:14,928
[Sakura’s strongest rival appeared]

32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,630
Geeze.

33
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,702
I’m not a monster.

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,471
About that dream we were talking about.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,835
You have a fair amount of magical power.

36
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,244
That dream could be…

37
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,810
It could be a premonition dream.

38
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,540
A premonition?

39
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,577
It means you might meet

40
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,716
that boy in the Chinese clothing
in the near future.

41
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,094
Sakura! You’ll be late!

42
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,729
OK!

43
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,565
Wait! Wait! Wait!

44
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,109
See you later.

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,834
I’m off!

46
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,580
Ah, there he is! Wait up!

47
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,186
You eat too much for breakfast.

48
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,884
But!

49
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,127
Ah. Yuki!

50
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,939
Good morning.

51
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,942
Did you have a good dream last night?

52
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,613
Dream?

53
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,545
I don’t think it was a very good dream.

54
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,181
I could hear incredible
moaning even in my room.

55
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,952
Just like a monster.

56
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,386
Brother.

57
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,719
Was it a scary dream?

58
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,092
No.

59
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,294
It was more of a strange dream.

60
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,064
There are such things
as premonition dreams.

61
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,307
That is the same as what Kero-chan said.

62
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,043
Actually I also had a premonition today.

63
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,744
I dreamt that I had roasted
fish for breakfast.

64
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,413
And then there really was fish,

65
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,348
so I ended up having seconds
on rice six times.

66
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,857
You seem well today Sakura-chan.

67
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,159
I was with Yukito all the way to school.

68
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,034
That is good.

69
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,239
I also got this.

70
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,864
See you later.

71
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,277
Tsukishiro-san is always
carrying something to eat.

72
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,355
Yeah, it’s because he eats a lot.

73
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,650
Very healthy.

74
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,214
Right!

75
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,357
Good morning.

76
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,819
Good morning, Rika-chan.

77
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,454
Good morning.

78
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,295
Time to begin homeroom.

79
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,533
It seems everybody is here.

80
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,983
Today
I have a transfer student to introduce.

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,854
Well, come in.

82
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,862
A transfer student at this time is rare.

83
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,299
Sakura-chan, isn’t he looking at you?

84
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,739
This is Shao-Ran Li,

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,065
he came from Hong Kong.

86
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,534
Everybody try to be friends with him.

87
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,871
As for a seat, let’s see.

88
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,906
Behind Kinomoto is open.

89
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,026
Your seat is over here.

90
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,711
It’s like…

91
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,216
It’s like his stare is painful.

92
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,756
It is like your spirit jumps.

93
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,890
You just have to talk to somebody about it.

94
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,956
You feel like writing a passage about it.

95
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,190
Why?

96
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,663
This is the first time
I have met this person.

97
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,139
Why? Why?

98
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,068
Why?

99
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,947
I’m exhausted.

100
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,853
Just a moment.

101
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,288
Umm, what is it?

102
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,429
The king of gods commands,
gods appear from all directions.

103
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,028
Gold, wood, water, fire, earth,

104
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,736
thunder, wind, lightning, the new command.

105
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,635
The king of gods commands,
gods appear from all directions.

106
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,668
Gold, wood, water, fire, earth, thunder,
wind, lightning, the new command.

107
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,069
Soft thunder, spinning lightning.

108
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,078
Obey the command!

109
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,457
It’s right.

110
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,725
So you have a Clow Card after all.

111
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,163
Why?

112
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,601
This compass

113
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,402
was made to search out Clow Cards.

114
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,271
Hand them over.

115
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,200
Hand over what?

116
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,209
The Clow Cards.

117
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,641
No!

118
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,506
I promised Kero-chan.

119
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,615
I said I would gather all the cards.

120
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,219
Kero-chan?

121
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,149
You mean Cerberus,
the beast of the seal?

122
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,991
You know him?

123
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,990
If Cerberus is around

124
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,627
why would he have such a child
hold the cards?

125
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,093
Kero-chan doesn’t have
enough magic power now

126
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,933
and can’t get big.

127
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:57,930
That’s why…

128
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,603
Cerberus’ symbol is the sun.

129
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,939
Combining fire and earth.

130
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,867
Don’t you have either card?

131
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,341
No.

132
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,173
How long have you been searching?

133
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,546
Since April of this year.

134
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,913
You’ve been searching two months

135
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,483
and you haven’t gotten them yet?

136
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,624
That’s true but…

137
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,593
Why do you know about the Clow Cards?

138
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,289
It has nothing to do with you.

139
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,126
I’ll find the rest. Give them to me!

140
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,168
No!

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,403
I can’t.

142
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,198
I got these with Kero-chan.

143
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,137
I see, in that pocket?

144
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,078
Sakura-chan?

145
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,316
Sakura-chan!

146
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,378
Hand them over.

147
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:48,880
No.

148
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:49,819
Stop that!

149
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,156
What are you doing to my sister?

150
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,623
Big brother?

151
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,424
Are you OK? Sakura-chan.

152
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,360
It’s nothing. More importantly,
my brother…

153
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,266
I haven’t seen that stance before.

154
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,004
Is it a Chinese style?

155
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,563
Hey! They had some.

156
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,131
They had some meat buns.

157
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,904
Here.

158
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,005
Yuki?

159
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,267
They still had some at the stand.

160
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,744
And pizza buns, curry buns…

161
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:47,878
Does everybody want one?

162
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,079
I have five of them.

163
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,377
Sure.

164
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,649
Let’s see… One, two, three,
four, five. Perfect.

165
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,883
Here. A meat bun.

166
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:05,795
Here.

167
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,176
What was that about?

168
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,452
Well, I have to leave here.

169
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,659
See you later.

170
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,794
Until tomorrow.

171
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,130
Huh? Rika-chan’s house isn’t that way is it?

172
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,836
I think she is on her way to buy a present.

173
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,665
It’s a birthday.

174
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,238
Who’s?

175
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,972
The person she likes.

176
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,574
Eh?!

177
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,571
It seems the person Rika-chan
likes is older than her.

178
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,643
You need to try hard too, Sakura-chan.

179
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,753
Did you ask Kero-chan about
the transfer student?

180
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
No. I tried calling,
but he didn’t answer.

181
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,862
Kero-chan is good about
getting up on time,

182
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,932
but when he goes to sleep

183
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,000
He won’t be up until it is time.

184
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,233
That’s appropriate for Kero-chan.

185
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,006
Thunder.

186
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,409
I wonder if it is a rainstorm?

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,478
Umm…

188
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,955
We can stay out of the rain in here.

189
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,292
It’s not falling.

190
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,932
Kero-chan. Kero-chan!

191
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,938
Stop sleeping and wake up.

192
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,765
Lots of terrible things happened today.

193
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,740
Kero-chan!

194
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,813
Shao-Ran Li?

195
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,455
He is probably a member of the Li clan.

196
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:47,956
Li clan?

197
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,853
My master Clow Leed.

198
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,363
His father was English

199
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,962
and his mother was Chinese.

200
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,231
That is why in Clow’s magic

201
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,436
there is lots of mixed
western and eastern magic.

202
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,073
The magic you are using now

203
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,744
It is the magical arts made by Clow.

204
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,147
With the ancient magic

205
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,475
if you follow the rules

206
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,549
anybody can do a certain amount.

207
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,952
But there are only
a few magicians in the world

208
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,159
who can make entirely new magic.

209
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,833
Clow really was an incredible person.

210
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,766
Well, he had some problems.

211
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,204
Problems?

212
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,034
Nothing.

213
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,776
The Li clan is
where Clow’s mother came from.

214
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,713
I hear they are famous
in China for their magic.

215
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,507
So that boy is…

216
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,316
A very distant relative of Clow.

217
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,051
I heard a rumor that the
Li clan moved to Hong Kong.

218
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,518
I guess it was true.

219
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,826
So.

220
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,989
So I should have given these cards to him?

221
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,724
That’s not true.

222
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,272
You woke me by opening this book.

223
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,072
I said this when we first met,

224
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,805
but there is a seal on this book,

225
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,777
so you have to have
a good deal of power to open it.

226
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,615
That means you have the right
to use these cards.

227
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,791
Your name is already written on these cards.

228
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,496
You are their owner.

229
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,161
Hello?

230
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,237
Sakura-chan.

231
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,339
Tomoyo-chan.

232
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,437
Sky…

233
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,902
Look at the sky.

234
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,306
Yeah, I can see it Tomoyo-chan.

235
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,045
It is the same as earlier.

236
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,927
Since today has to do with thunder,

237
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,230
I made everything out of rubber
so as not to conduct electricity.

238
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,595
What about this bell?

239
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,896
That is also a material
that won’t conduct.

240
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,001
So why a cat?

241
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,635
That is because it is cute.

242
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,714
This is Thunder.

243
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,988
It seems strong.

244
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,918
Fly.

245
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,155
How brave.

246
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,768
You said the guy we were talking
about earlier had a compass right?

247
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,803
Yeah, it looked like it had all sorts
of characters written on it.

248
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,038
Clow said

249
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,969
that compass was passed down
through his mother’s family.

250
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,705
Alright, that boy might come

251
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,340
looking for Thunder.

252
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,974
You should catch the card before that.

253
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,650
OK, I’ll do my best.

254
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,493
How can I return it to being a card?

255
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,057
First you have to return it to
its original form.

256
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,531
Original form?

257
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:16,933
Here it comes.

258
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,127
Jump.

259
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,280
But what is Thunder’s original form?

260
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,679
Thunder is really…

261
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,252
Do you not know that either?

262
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,554
Li-kun.

263
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,225
Come thunder and obey the command.

264
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,510
It’s the same as the dream.

265
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,431
It looks scary!

266
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,862
You can capture Thunder
after returning it to beast form.

267
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,969
Don’t you even know that?

268
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,434
I was just about to explain that.

269
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,150
Are you stupid?
Windy can’t counter Thunder.

270
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,154
But there are cards I have caught
by hitting them with Windy.

271
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,990
I have been in Kansai long enough

272
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,488
that I can take being called a moron,

273
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,128
but to be called stupid…

274
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,630
Do you have the Shadow card?

275
00:18:59,138 --> 00:18:59,661
Yeah.

276
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:00,731
All right.

277
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,570
Magic of impact obey the command.

278
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,284
Now!

279
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,886
Shadow!

280
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,202
Return to your rightful form,

281
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,410
Clow Card!

282
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,151
So that is the rod of sealing?

283
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,090
But you really don’t know anything.

284
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,930
Hey! Don’t ask the impossible,

285
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,895
Sakura just started collecting the cards.

286
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,335
Who is this?

287
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,704
It’s Kero-chan.

288
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:08,969
What?

289
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,611
So this is the beast of the seal, Cerberus?

290
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,642
The golden eyed invincible protective beast?

291
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,809
Is this stuffed animal?

292
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,121
Kero-chan.

293
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,924
Anyways, it is impossible for you

294
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,528
to gather the Clow Cards
with that level of power.

295
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,774
Sakura-chan, are you hurt?

296
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,214
Sakura-chan?
