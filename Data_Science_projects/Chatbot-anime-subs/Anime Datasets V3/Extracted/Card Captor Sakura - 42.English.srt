1
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:24,950
This feels okay?

2
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:26,715
Thanks, Sakura-chan.

3
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,220
I’m so nervous!

4
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,681
I hope I won’t say
the wrong lines.

5
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:32,857
Don’t worry.

6
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,524
You guys practiced so much.

7
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,819
Sakura-chan, you still
haven’t changed yet?

8
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:42,128
Tomoyo said she’s making
the costumes for Li-kun and me,

9
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:43,729
But she’s not here yet.

10
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:45,797
Sorry to keep you waiting!

11
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:49,206
Tomoyo-chan!

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,473
I stayed up two nights to finish this.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,747
Are you okay?

14
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,641
This is a costume
that you are going to wear!

15
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,675
I cannot allow any mistakes!

16
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,317
Now, let us get changed quickly!

17
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:06,953
Li-kun too!

18
00:01:08,663 --> 00:01:14,431
[Sakura’s Pitch-Dark Literary Fest]

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,642
Too bad your father can’t make it.

20
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,013
He said he couldn’t leave
the excavation site no matter what.

21
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,315
This is really too bad.

22
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,442
So, you’re taking pictures. Yeah.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,519
Father asked me to take them.

24
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:39,526
Sakura’s is the first class to perform.

25
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:42,594
It’s the Sleeping Beauty.

26
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:45,757
Come to think of it,
you did one last year too

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,167
Cinderella.

28
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:58,409
I didn’t need to remember that.

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,373
Why not? You looked so nice in that.

30
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:04,546
The president of the photography club
told me…

31
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,353
…that your pictures at
the Literary Fest sold the best.

32
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,514
That guy from the
photography club said that?

33
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,421
I wonder what role Sakura plays.

34
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,263
I’m really looking forward to it!

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,695
Who would want to invite
an evil witch like you…

36
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,900
Sakura-chan, you look so cool!

37
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,775
You look wonderful! Really!

38
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,645
Tomoyo-chan made an awesome costume,
that’s all.

39
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:34,972
Really, you look very nice in it.

40
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,512
Mizuki-sensei!

41
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:38,415
Really.
And you can move freely wearing it.

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,445
You’ll be okay even
if anything happens.

43
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,054
Eh!

44
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,765
Absolutely no way!!

45
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:59,138
Li-kun is so cute!!

46
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:04,605
You look so nice in it!
Not at all!

47
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:08,481
Why do I have to wear
this frilly stuff!

48
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:09,975
Because you are the Princess?

49
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:13,445
On top of that,
what’s this wavy hair?!

50
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:15,278
I absolutely hate this!

51
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:18,050
Just now I was looking at the audience,

52
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,451
and I saw Mr. Tsukishiro.

53
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:23,454
Yukito-san…

54
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,890
I am sure Mr. Tsukishiro has come here
in order to watch the Sleeping Beauty!

55
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:31,634
I bet the play has to be cancelled.

56
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,304
If the play is cancelled,

57
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,738
I am sure Mr. Tsukishiro
will be saddened by this.

58
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,371
We practiced so much,

59
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,116
let’s do it, Li-kun!

60
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,016
I’ll do it.

61
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:02,729
Yo! Tomoyo!
I’ve come to watch!

62
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:04,764
Welcome, Kero!

63
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:19,252
Now, let’s begin.

64
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,279
Thank you for your patience.

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,093
Class 5-2 will now present to you,
the Sleeping Beauty.

66
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,954
It’s starting!

67
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,099
One upon a time,

68
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,032
there lived

69
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,601
a King and a Queen.

70
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,511
Their kingdom is
prosperous and very peaceful.

71
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:51,243
However, for the longest time, the King
and the Queen did not have a child.

72
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,109
This is Tomoyo-chan’s voice, isn’t it?

73
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:56,619
One day, at last,

74
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:01,059
a Princess was born after
their many prayers.

75
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:06,900
Today is the celebration
of the Princess’ birthday.

76
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:10,303
Ladies and gentlemen, you may present
your blessings to the Princess.

77
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:13,103
Isn’t that a guy playing the Queen?

78
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,605
For the lovely Princess,

79
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,837
We fairies have come…

80
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,737
…to present our gifts.

81
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:26,543
Her beauty shall shine
like the brightest sun!

82
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,490
She shall have the sweetest voice

83
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,089
that would lose to no one!

84
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:35,495
I…

85
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,501
What a grand party it is today!

86
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,334
But I was not sent an invitation.

87
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:51,336
Who would want to invite
an evil witch like you!

88
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,373
An evil witch? I wonder who that is!

89
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:57,216
I am really sorry.

90
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,711
I was told that

91
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,213
you do not like merry occasions.

92
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,246
Right, right.

93
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:03,920
I do not like merry occasions.

94
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,189
But I hate even more
if I was being neglected!

95
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:11,656
So now, why don’t I also give
my blessings to the Princess?

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,661
With her beauty, her elegance,
and her gentleness,

97
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,960
the Princess shall be loved

98
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:18,671
by her people every day.

99
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:22,670
And then, on her sixteenth birthday,

100
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,534
she shall prick
her finger with a spindle,

101
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,012
And die!!

102
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,220
Mei Lin-chan is awesome!

103
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,584
During practice,

104
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:43,019
she kept saying she didn’t
want to play the bad guy.

105
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,490
She’s the type that can
just do the real thing right.

106
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,458
Oh no!

107
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,837
What a terrible curse
from that witch!

108
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,205
Th… This is too cruel!

109
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:56,839
Is there no way to break
the curse of the witch?

110
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,913
I still have not presented
my gift to the Princess.

111
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:07,109
The Princess shall prick her finger

112
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,912
with a spindle on
her sixteenth birthday.

113
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,849
However, she shall not die from it.
She shall only be asleep.

114
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:17,295
A true love for the Princess shall

115
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,666
break the spell of the witch,

116
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,792
And from the kiss of this person,
may the Princess be awoken!

117
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,971
Everyone’s doing’ great!

118
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,410
Tomoyo, you too!

119
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,704
Thank you very much!

120
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:36,446
That bratty girl playing the
evil witch was just perfect!

121
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,718
So,

122
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,610
Sakura and that brat still
haven’t had their turn yet?

123
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:41,887
They are in the next scene.

124
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,656
Having heard the curse
from the witch,

125
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:52,795
the King ordered
that all spindles be burned.

126
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:57,760
All the people in the kingdom obeyed

127
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,602
and destroyed all the spindles.

128
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,067
And no spindles exist in the country.

129
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,168
Sixteen years passed.

130
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:07,306
The Princess has blossomed
into beautiful young woman.

131
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:11,715
My dear Princess!

132
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,144
Yes, Mother.

133
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:17,649
He’s the Princess?!

134
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,290
Wow! He looks pretty good!

135
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,798
What is it?! Mother?!

136
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:37,172
Today is the party for
your sixteenth birthday.

137
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:39,110
Please hurry and get change!

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,879
Yes, Mother!

139
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:45,715
That’s a miscast!

140
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,714
The Princess returned to her room.

141
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,316
And there stood a spindle,

142
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:55,092
which should no longer
exist in this kingdom.

143
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,123
Oh, I wonder what this is!

144
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:02,767
This hu… hurts!!

145
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,508
Oh no! My Princess has died!

146
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:11,376
My lovely Princess!

147
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,277
No, that is not true, Your Highness!

148
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,548
The Princess has only fallen asleep!

149
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,216
Just as the gift I presented
to her sixteen years ago.

150
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,083
Now, let us wait for the one

151
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,017
who can wake the Princess!

152
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:35,993
It’s the next scene.

153
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,924
This will capture

154
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:02,319
all of Sakura’s heroic actions!

155
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:05,059
Oh? It’s her turn finally?

156
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,928
A long, long time has gone by,

157
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,628
and finally a Prince
has come to this kingdom.

158
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,974
Sakura! Sakura-chan plays the Prince!

159
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,119
Yukito-san!

160
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,650
Oh! She looks awesome!

161
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,159
I stayed up two nights to make it!

162
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:37,061
So, this is the mysterious castle!

163
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,829
We have been waiting for you!

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,332
Who are you?!

165
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:44,861
We are fairies.

166
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,168
We have been waiting for

167
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,807
a courageous young man to arrive.

168
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:51,042
What?

169
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:53,313
There is a beautiful Princess

170
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,444
asleep in this castle.

171
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:59,216
Under the curse of an evil witch,
she has been sleeping for a long time.

172
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,915
How terrible!

173
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,853
Is there a way I can save her?

174
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,750
You can, if you think seriously
that you want to save her.

175
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,025
I have this sword and courage in me!

176
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,091
I promise

177
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,266
I will break the curse for the Princess!

178
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,303
Sakura-chan looks so cool!

179
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,403
Good job! Good job!

180
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,443
Sakura is just too wonderful!

181
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:36,080
You have done well to get here, Prince.

182
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,726
You must be the evil witch
who cursed the Princess!

183
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:42,825
Everyone! Go get him!

184
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:52,530
Awesome! Awesome!

185
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:55,604
She’s just good at sports, that’s all.

186
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,577
Damn you, Prince!

187
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,816
I did it! I defeated the witch!

188
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:20,156
Oh! What a beautiful Princess!

189
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,900
The Princess can only be woken…

190
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:32,403
…by the kiss of the one
who truly loves her.

191
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:36,913
Kiss the Princess,

192
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,379
if you can truly love her.

193
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,584
Oh! Here’s the good part!

194
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:58,230
If only I play the Prince!

195
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:12,651
Don’t tell me
she’s really gonna kiss…!

196
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:23,752
This aura!!

197
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,263
Li-kun!

198
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:28,994
Oh no! This is…!!

199
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,972
Huh? What happened?
Did the lights go out?

200
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,207
Be careful! It’s a Clow Card!

201
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:38,441
This is Da … Li-kun! Li-kun!

202
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,910
Did you say this is because
of a Clow Card?!

203
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:45,377
That’s right!

204
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,016
Kero-chan should be in the
control room with Tomoyo-chan!

205
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,524
But…

206
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,886
Which way is the control room?!

207
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:06,736
Sakura…

208
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,405
Kero-chan! Tomoyo-chan!

209
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,009
Li-kun! Mei Lin-chan!

210
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,951
I’ve been running

211
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:23,323
but I don’t seem to be getting
anywhere… No one’s around…

212
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:28,684
Anyone will do! Just answer me!

213
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,602
Where did everyone go?

214
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:47,513
Am I all by myself?

215
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,220
Do your best, Sakura!

216
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:55,813
The only way to seal this card

217
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,020
is to realize that herself!

218
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,928
It’s no use crying.

219
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:17,174
Everyone’s probably scared
because of this darkness!

220
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,645
Li-kun said
this is the act of a Clow Card.

221
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,874
So, maybe I can do something about it!

222
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:29,116
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

223
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:32,717
reveal thy true form before me.

224
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,322
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

225
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:39,889
Release!

226
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,867
I can’t use magic…

227
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:51,566
Calm down…

228
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,814
First, I need to think
what card this is…

229
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,799
It’s not ‘Black’… is it?

230
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,696
It’s pitch-dark… Could it be…

231
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,600
Dark, as in darkness?

232
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,443
I guessed right!

233
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,145
Sakura realized the nature of the card!

234
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:32,006
But…

235
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,113
It turned pitch-dark again…

236
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,355
Just by realizing the nature of the card

237
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,024
is not enough to seal it.

238
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,291
She’s gotta realize that herself!

239
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:47,364
If it’s Sakura,
she should be able to realize it!

240
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,364
It’s not like with Mirror

241
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,265
that I can just name the card…

242
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:58,675
I gotta think

243
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:02,411
what can I do in pitch-dark!
I gotta think!

244
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:09,183
But if it’s really pitch-dark,

245
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,488
I shouldn’t be able to see myself…

246
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:14,893
How come I can see myself…?

247
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,895
What?!

248
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,323
She’s being taken in by darkness!

249
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:23,632
At this rate,

250
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:26,128
she’ll be trapped inside darkness!

251
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,769
Sakura! Hurry up and notice it!

252
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:34,511
At this rate,
I won’t even be able to see myself!

253
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,307
Don’t cry!

254
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,419
It’ll be okay. It’ll all work out.

255
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,485
It’ll be okay for sure!

256
00:17:58,672 --> 00:17:59,536
I’m shining!

257
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,141
I see! If I shine,

258
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:03,671
then of course
I can see myself in the dark!

259
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,393
Are you a Clow Card too?

260
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,193
That’s right. Since the time you broke
the seal on the cards,

261
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,836
I’ve been living inside your heart.

262
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,135
I didn’t know at all.

263
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,310
Because you never gave up,

264
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,010
You finally realized my presence,

265
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,478
And you let me out.

266
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:50,414
Now here’s a quiz for you.

267
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,283
What shines in the dark?

268
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,933
Light!

269
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,612
You guessed right!

270
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,515
You are… Dark?!

271
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:23,079
I’m glad you noticed Light.

272
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,523
She knew all along that

273
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,158
you would be able to seal me.

274
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,687
Of course, she’s the girl
whose heart I’ve been living in!

275
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,660
Now, you should be able
to use your magic.

276
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,910
Try sealing both of us together!

277
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:39,703
O… Okay!

278
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,336
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

279
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,847
reveal thy true form before me.

280
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,348
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

281
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,219
Release!

282
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,821
Return to thy form which thou should be!

283
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,063
Clow Card!

284
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:18,006
We would love
to have you as our mistress.

285
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:21,272
Only Yue will be the Last Judgment.

286
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:22,905
Good luck to you.

287
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,008
Yue?!

288
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,686
Excuse me… ‘Yue’…?!

289
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,056
Yue is close to you.

290
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:38,187
But it’s going to be okay!

291
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:44,362
Because you have the invincible spell:
‘It’ll be okay for sure!’

292
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:49,138
It’s the same as the dream…

293
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,579
I’m so glad! You really came back!

294
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,187
Hey! That little!

295
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:07,150
Hey! I dare you getting all
out of hand like that!

296
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:10,656
What happened?

297
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:12,430
You didn’t notice, did you?

298
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,094
It’s a Clow Card.

299
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,536
It’s the card, Dark,

300
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:20,295
which only pulled those with
magic into the dimension it created.

301
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:22,472
I totally did not feel it…

302
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:23,902
To those with no magic,

303
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:25,973
it’s as though
time has simply continued on.

304
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:31,842
I can sense it…
The power of the moon…

305
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,887
Yue,

306
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:38,156
I guess the time for us
to meet will be very soon…

307
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:54,532
“It’ll be okay for sure,” right?
