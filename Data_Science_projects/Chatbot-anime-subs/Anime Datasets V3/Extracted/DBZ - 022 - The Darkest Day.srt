1
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,435
It's a person!

2
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:13,097
There's- there's a person
coming out of it!

3
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,062
W- what do those guys want!?

4
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:38,393
Who are they?

5
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:44,069
" Earth," they called it, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

6
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:48,267
Shall we say hello to those annoying,
peeping little chicks?

7
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,299
Not too hard, now.

8
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:07,092
What was that!?

9
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:10,528
W- what the hell did they do!?

10
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,033
W- what the-?

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,058
I- it's unheard-of!

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,397
Perhaps that greeting
was a bit too polite.

13
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,234
Leave it at that, Nappa.
If we go at it too excessively,

14
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,236
we won't be able to sell
this planet for a high price.

15
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,737
O- oh, yeah.

16
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,905
Now that you mention it,

17
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,574
we were going to look for those
whatever-they're-called balls,

18
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,076
which can grant us any wish, huh?

19
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,412
Dragon Balls.

20
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,548
How about we first find
the one who killed Raditz,

21
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,418
and ask him about the Dragon Balls?

22
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,752
Sure.

23
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:12,424
Now, supposing that one of those
Dragon Ball things was in the area,

24
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:17,362
our wish for eternal life
would have been wiped out,

25
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:20,699
thanks to that senseless
"greeting" of yours.

26
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,370
S- sorry about that.
It completely slipped my mind.

27
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,973
Well, what's done is done.
First thing we need to do

28
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,376
is find the guy who has
the highest battle power.

29
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:37,713
He'll be the one who killed Raditz.
Either him, or Kakarrot's son.

30
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:45,090
That's strange. I'm picking up
more than just one or two readings

31
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,887
that have a battle power
higher than 1000.

32
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,729
What are they doing on this planet?

33
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,399
Don't panic.
They're still no match for us.

34
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,301
In any case, find the one
who has the highest battle power.

35
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:05,076
I found him!

36
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:08,413
There are two fairly
high battle powers together.

37
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:12,315
All right, Nappa, let's go have some fun.

38
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:30,368
Currently, the cause of the large-scale
earthquake is a complete mystery.

39
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,736
All communications with Metro East,

40
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,038
which is thought to have been
the epicenter of this earthquake,

41
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:38,202
have been cut off, and the safety
of its residents is in doubt.

42
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:43,047
T- they're finally here, are they?

43
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,050
Let's go help them out.
With this, I can tell where they are.

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,383
I- I'm going over my dead body!

45
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:57,061
I- I'm going! I'm sure
Yamucha-<i>sama</i> will be going, too!

46
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,731
No, let's not.

47
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:02,066
There's too great a
difference in our levels.

48
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:05,570
Even if I did go,
I'd just be in the way.

49
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,073
All we can do is pray
for their victory from here.

50
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,075
Y- you're probably right.

51
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,410
Right! Right!

52
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,346
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>, don't die!

53
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:18,016
Son-<i>kun</i>, get here soon!

54
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,847
Get here soon!

55
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,920
<i>Hold out until I get there, everyone!</i>

56
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:43,308
This is great! This planet " Earth" here
has fairly little gravity,

57
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:46,766
and we can move with
no difficulty at all!

58
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:55,386
They're moving at incredible speed!

59
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:59,720
They're heading straight for that area
where those two other large <i>Ki</i> are!

60
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,861
Is that where
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i> and them are?

61
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,064
Or is it where Piccolo
and Goku's son are?

62
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:09,067
They're coming.
They intend to come here.

63
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,068
Right.

64
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,737
Chaozu, you stay here!

65
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:17,008
No way! I'm coming, too!
I trained hard, and I'm coming!

66
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:19,499
Together with you, Ten-<i>san</i>!

67
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,578
W- what the hell happened here!?

68
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,438
Er, the scene is more terrible
than you can imagine.

69
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:50,375
Metro East has been wiped out
without a trace.

70
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,866
What in the world
could have happened here?

71
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:57,048
Chief, how is the investigation coming?

72
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:59,384
We haven't the faintest idea.

73
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:02,387
This ain't no ordinary case!

74
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,412
Who is that?

75
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:15,055
I knew it! So this
was the Saiyan's doin'!

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,671
Are they tellin' me I gotta
fight someone with this kinda power!?

77
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,339
H- hey, you!

78
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,677
What are you doing there!?
A- are you the one who did this!?

79
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,680
You dimwit! There ain't
no way I coulda done this!

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,776
If I had this sorta power,
I wouldn't be so scared, y'know!?

81
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,355
You know something, don't you!?

82
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,356
Chief!

83
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,023
Hey!

84
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,694
This was done by aliens,
who're called " Saiyans" !

85
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,363
W- what!? Aliens!?

86
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:50,368
They're fixin' to exterminate
everyone on earth! Every last one!

87
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:57,208
My boys're fightin' 'em right now for ya,
to make sure they don't get their way.

88
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,334
Ya got that!?

89
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,391
Of all things!

90
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,328
Come on, now, it's dangerous
for the general public to be here!

91
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,330
Go home! Go home!

92
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,332
There <i>are</i> guys like this one
running around out there, you know.

93
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:23,334
True, true...

94
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:28,362
All right then, you guys! How do <i>you</i>
explain this weird situation!? Eh!?

95
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,010
'sides, look over there at those!

96
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,679
Kind of large for basketballs,
aren't they?

97
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,347
You stupid numbskull!

98
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,349
N- numbskull!?

99
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,352
Those're the spaceships
that the Saiyan's came in!

100
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:43,354
--Spaceships!?
--Spaceships!?
--Spaceships!?

101
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,023
T- they couldn't be!

102
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:47,358
So check 'em out!

103
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,360
Hey, crime lab!

104
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,029
--Yes?
--Yes?

105
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,031
Examine- examine those things.

106
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,157
--Right!
--Right!

107
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:59,663
I'm from AHO TV.
C- come over here a second...

108
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,375
I'd like to hear all the details.

109
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:09,047
I tell ya, I sure am
gettin' hungry, here...

110
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,381
Y- you want an appearance fee?

111
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,716
C- Chief!

112
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:15,653
T- this definitely is not of this earth!

113
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,642
W- what!?

114
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:23,661
I'll pay you whatever money you ask!
So, where are these Saiyan guys now?

115
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:27,665
AHO TV-<i>san</i>, you're not
getting the scoop on us!

116
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,334
We'll pay as much as you like, too.

117
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,669
Us, too!

118
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:32,336
Us, as well!

119
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:33,671
Us, too!

120
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,006
Me, too!

121
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:39,500
In that case, to keep ya all
from fightin', I'll tell ya all!

122
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,439
You can stick your wads of bills in here.

123
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,217
How's that?

124
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,056
I got it!

125
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,390
They're that way!

126
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,060
No, this way, this way!

127
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,063
Lessee...

128
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:36,067
About 6000 kilometers in that direction.

129
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,735
6000 kilos?

130
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,100
South, huh?

131
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:44,575
I won't steer ya wrong, though.
You'd best not get too close to 'em.

132
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:48,412
These're some pretty
horrific guys, after all.

133
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,414
We're going to be the
first ones there, for sure!

134
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,006
No, we are!

135
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,086
We're leaving, too!

136
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:58,422
We're going to capture the aliens!

137
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,758
Hunh, no hope for 'em.

138
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:04,854
All right... I'm gonna
eat my fill with this!

139
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:09,767
Could be the last meal
I ever eat in this world...

140
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,200
Prob'ly...

141
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,582
<i>The time was 12:20 p.m.</i>
<i>The birds and animals</i>

142
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:30,714
<i>sensed a presence out of the ordinary,</i>
<i>and had begun leaving the area.</i>

143
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:47,672
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We've become so strong,

144
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:50,074
it's incomparable to
what we were a year ago.

145
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,742
R- right!

146
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,412
Something is coming this way
from that direction, too!

147
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,747
And someone is coming
from over here, as well!

148
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:59,580
W- weren't there only
going to be two Saiyans?

149
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:02,753
A Saiyan!?

150
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:06,090
Hey, long time no see, Piccolo.

151
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,427
Oh, it's you, huh?

152
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:14,699
What business do you have here?
Did you come to get in our way?

153
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:18,369
Don't talk like that.
I've improved a little, myself.

154
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:24,041
So it appears. Looks like there are
some other fools who mean to come here.

155
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:29,046
Yeah, I'm sure everyone is coming.
I guess I was just the closest one.

156
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:33,050
I remember! You're one of the people
that was at the Turtle Hermit-<i>sama</i>'s place.

157
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,321
Yeah, Kuririn. You've beefed up
quite a bit, haven't you?

158
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,551
You're just like Goku was,
when he was a kid.

159
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:44,729
You're small, but strong, right?
Father said that about you a lot.

160
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:47,398
You're going to fight
alongside us, right?

161
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:50,668
He didn't have to
include that " small" part.

162
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,738
That jerk- he grows a little bit taller,
and thinks he's so big...

163
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:57,742
Still, it must have been rough,
having Piccolo train you like this, right?

164
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:01,576
Mm-hmm. But Piccolo-<i>san</i> is a
much better person than I thought.

165
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,973
Enough chit-chat! They're here!

166
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,060
There they are, there they are!

167
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,031
There's one more of them now,
making three tough guys.

168
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:24,127
It appears that they know all about us.

169
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,039
T- those are the Saiyans, huh?

170
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,042
Indeed, I can sense an
incredible <i>Ki</i> from them.

171
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,569
D- danger truly is closing in on us!

172
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,892
It looks as though you've
been waiting anxiously for us.

173
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,135
You've got that right.

174
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,019
Just for the record,
let me ask you,

175
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,688
what the hell have you come here for?

176
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:18,689
That voice...

177
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:22,693
So, you're the one
who defeated Raditz, right?

178
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,694
Voice?

179
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,958
Didn't Raditz tell you?

180
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:30,194
This acts as a communicator, too.

181
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,705
He's a Namekian!

182
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:40,711
So it would seem. I guess it's not
that surprising that Raditz was done in.

183
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:43,047
Namekian?

184
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:48,052
Piccolo! Y- you're an alien, too?
That would explain...

185
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,520
I- is that right, Piccolo-<i>san</i>?

186
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:57,862
I get it. In addition to having
an unusually high battle power,

187
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:00,422
I've heard that Namekians
have certain remarkable abilities.

188
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,404
<i>l'm a Namekian?</i>

189
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:12,604
I've also heard that there are some of them
that can perform magician-like feats.

190
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:20,579
You must be the one who created
these Dragon Ball things.

191
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,688
Y- you even know about the Dragon Balls!?

192
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:28,426
The Dragon Balls
are our first objective.

193
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,694
Hand them over to us
without making any trouble.

194
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:37,065
Even if you are Namekian, by yourself,
you're no more than a housefly to us.

195
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:44,708
Thanks. Because of you, I'm more-or-less
starting to understand my heritage.

196
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,044
But, unfortunately for you,

197
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:49,842
I'm not the one who
created the Dragon Balls.

198
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:55,212
I'm the kind that specializes
in fighting, you see.

199
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:00,983
Come try me, and we'll see
whether or not I'm a housefly!

200
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,064
Kami-<i>sama</i>...

201
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:13,304
I- I didn't know. To think
that I am an alien...

202
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:17,172
No wonder I always felt so
different from everyone else.

203
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:23,503
I am definitely the one who
created the Dragon Balls long ago.

204
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:28,352
Even though it was the first time
I had ever made any,

205
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,687
they seemed strangely familiar.

206
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,557
There was probably
someone on Planet Namek

207
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:38,585
that also created something
like the Dragon Balls.

208
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:47,133
There were still memories of
my distant ancestors within me.

209
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,448
Pipe down!

210
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:19,792
It looks like you don't have any intention
of telling us about the Dragon Balls.

211
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,836
Fine with me. You'll talk,
even if I have to force it out of you!

212
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,642
981...

213
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,376
1220...

214
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,686
1083...

215
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:40,180
Miserable fools! You plan on facing us
with that kind of battle power?

216
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,026
Nappa,

217
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,694
take off your Scouter.

218
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,029
What?

219
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,366
These guys can alter their
battle powers in response to the battle.

220
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,369
We can't rely on these values anymore.

221
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,371
Now that you mention it, that's right.

222
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:56,440
That idiotic wimp Raditz got done in

223
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,900
because he got overconfident
in his Scouter's figures, after all.

224
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:05,049
" T- that wimp Raditz" ?

225
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,385
R- Raditz was that Saiyan

226
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:11,946
that you and Goku barely managed
to defeat together, right?

227
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,994
Wimp, huh?

228
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,332
I know- what do you say we have ourselves
a look at what they are capable of?

229
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:27,004
Hey, Nappa, there are still six
Saibaimen left, right? Bring them out.

230
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,007
Vegeta, you sure do like
having a good time, huh?

231
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,009
S- Saibaiman?

232
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,567
W- what's that?

233
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,681
Six of them, all right.

234
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,750
Once you see the Saibaimen,

235
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,947
I imagine you'll want to tell us
about the Dragon Balls.

236
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,484
This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

237
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,469
W- what is that?

238
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,408
All right!

239
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:24,150
T- those guys are creepy!

240
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,377
T- these guys are pretty good!

241
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,004
So it would appear.

242
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:23,551
Those three are your targets.
Do them some harm, Saibaimen.

243
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,729
<i>Saibaimen, born of the soil...</i>

244
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,732
<i>Their power is the real deal.</i>

245
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:37,067
<i>Will Gohan...</i>

246
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,402
<i>...Kuririn...</i>

247
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:45,399
<i>...and Piccolo be able to hold out</i>
<i>against them until Goku returns?</i>

248
