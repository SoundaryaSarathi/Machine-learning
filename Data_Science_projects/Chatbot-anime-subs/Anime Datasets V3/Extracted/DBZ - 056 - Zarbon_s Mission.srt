00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,236
Where are you!?

2
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:12,904
Where are you!?

3
00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:15,338
Where did you run off to,
Vegeta!?

4
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:19,177
He couldn't have gotten
away that fast.

5
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,913
He must be hiding somewhere.

6
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:24,848
Have you not found
him yet, Zarbon-<i>san</i>!?

7
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:32,524
If you disgracefully allow him
to escape you like this,

8
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:35,516
I will have you take
responsibility with your life.

9
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:41,365
Fool! Go ahead and search
outside as much as you like.

10
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:46,938
1... 2... 3... 4...

11
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,702
There are indeed
five of them here.

12
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,612
Not only have they
healed my injuries,

13
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:57,378
they're going to have every last one
of their Dragon Balls taken from them.

14
00:00:58,883 --> 00:01:02,554
But I can't get away
carrying all five of them.

15
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:06,388
What's more, it doesn't look like I have
the time to calmly think this over.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,993
All right...

17
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:33,179
Please, let this work!

18
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:38,590
Hey! You fell for it!
I'm still inside the ship!

19
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,182
What was that!?

20
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:02,210
D- damn it all!

21
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,658
Now!

22
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,670
Where is Vegeta!?

23
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:38,174
D- do not tell me that Vegeta
is after the Dragon Balls!

24
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,032
All right, and now for me!

25
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,704
T- the Dragon Balls!

26
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,700
That bastard!!

27
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,480
W- where is he this time!?

28
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:31,903
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, is he still
inside the spaceship?

29
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:32,904
Look for him!

30
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,394
Y- yes, sir!

31
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,518
<i>lf I were to unwisely</i>
<i>escape through the air,</i>

32
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:51,012
<i>Freeza would overtake</i>
<i>me in an instant.</i>

33
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,299
What disgraceful behavior!

34
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,479
Not only did you allow
Vegeta to escape,

35
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,215
but with the Dragon Balls, as well!

36
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,651
There is no way that
he could have run away

37
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,886
with all five Dragon Balls
in that short moment!

38
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,155
I will search the inside
of the spaceship,

39
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:27,225
so you are to thoroughly
search outside!

40
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,328
You are prepared to
answer for this, yes?

42
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:35,823
If you are unable to bring
Vegeta back here in one hour...

43
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,505
Y- yes, sir!

44
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:26,551
Let's see...

45
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,644
It's around here.

46
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:01,184
T- this is awful...

47
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:10,624
Vegeta must have done this.

48
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,124
Who's there?
Is someone there?

49
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:31,481
Oh...

50
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,496
And after they had grown
this many of them...

51
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:24,699
I'm sure they should have
fallen around here somewhere.

52
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,875
There they are!
There they are!

53
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,716
That's magnificent control,
if I do say so myself.

54
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:41,549
Take that, Freeza.

55
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,721
I've finally gotten
your Dragon Balls!

56
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:55,566
Now, including the one that
I sunk at that village,

57
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,229
I only need one more
to have all seven.

58
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:03,906
A strong battle power!
Is that Zarbon?

59
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:08,737
No, the battle power
is lower than Zarbon's.

60
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,841
I- is that!?

61
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,191
Just you wait, Gohan!

62
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,859
Once you go to
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>'s place,

63
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,851
you'll become much,
much stronger!

64
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:33,037
He's that Earthling!

65
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:36,541
W- why is he here
on Planet Namek?

66
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:41,205
What's more, he was holding
the final Dragon Ball.

67
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,873
Just how far is luck
going to go my way!?

68
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,173
That's the last one.

69
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:30,351
People of Planet Namek,
may you please rest in peace.

70
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,523
Now then, I have to hurry
and look for that Dragon Ball.

71
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,888
Huh? This way?

72
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,220
It's not inside a house?

73
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:11,102
I get it. Not even Vegeta would
find it if it's in the lake, huh?

74
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,538
Here it is!

75
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,491
Here it is, here it is.

76
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:28,001
9995... 9996...

77
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:37,351
9997...

78
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,525
After I've done 10,000 of these,

79
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:47,531
I'll do 60-times gravity.
I'm on it...

80
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:50,694
9998...

81
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,862
9999...

82
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,038
10,000!

83
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,845
W- what is this?
I can't move my body at all...

84
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,676
Dammit...

85
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,343
That was fast!
I'll be there real soon!

86
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,027
It looks like that Earthling is
after the Dragon Balls as well.

87
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:55,032
But I'm going to take that
one that you're holding.

88
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:59,025
Then I will have all seven
of the Dragon Balls!

89
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:05,367
Dammit! Where the hell is Vegeta!?

90
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:09,969
If only I had a Scouter,
I could easily detect him!

91
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:24,989
If it keeps going like this, I'll have
to surrender my life to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

92
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,491
Is that Vegeta!?

93
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:38,009
No, that's the guy who rescued
that Namekian kid.

94
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,501
But he's carrying something
that looks like a Dragon Ball.

95
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,180
Vegeta!

96
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,520
I've finally found you!

97
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,351
You're mine now!

98
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,309
There's a huge battle power following me.

99
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,154
It looks like Zarbon has found me.

100
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,156
What an annoying bastard.

101
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
But this is a good opportunity.

102
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,826
I'll take care of him for sure this time.

103
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,663
He'll be full of confidence in himself
after our previous battle.

104
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,891
His guard ought to be down.

105
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:49,169
It will take more than this!

106
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>This is crazy, Goku!</i>

107
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,849
Bulma's daddy...

108
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:06,464
<i>You're going to die, suddenly jumping</i>
<i>to 100-times gravity like that.</i>

109
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:11,135
I- I was doing it at 50-times gravity...

110
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:14,805
Are you sure the machine ain't broken?

111
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:18,809
<i>Don't be absurd!</i>
<i>My machine is flawless.</i>

112
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,145
B- but still...

113
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,136
<i>Just a moment.</i>

114
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,314
W- what's this?

115
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,834
<i>l figured it out, Goku.</i>

116
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:48,172
<i>The gravity device control</i>
<i>has become unstable.</i>

117
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:53,508
<i>lt's because your spaceship has</i>
<i>entered an intense magnetic storm.</i>

118
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,837
W- what do I do?

119
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:03,787
<i>lt will take another hour before</i>
<i>you're through the magnetic storm.</i>

120
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,856
A- an hour?

121
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:08,792
I ain't going to last that long!

122
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,793
<i>ln any event,</i>

123
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:13,797
<i>you have to turn off the gravity machine's</i>
<i>switch without a moment's delay.</i>

124
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:16,960
T- that's easy for you to say...

125
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:52,824
Huh?

126
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,444
Well if it isn't Kuririn!
Don't startle me like that!

127
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,113
I- isn't this dangerous,
Bulma-<i>san</i>?

128
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,182
If you're outside leisurely
reading a book,

129
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:07,451
they're going to find you.

130
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,686
What are you talking about?

131
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:11,121
If I stay inside that cave
all the time, I'll-

132
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:15,182
Huh? Could that be... a Dragon Ball?

133
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,352
You got it!

134
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:23,866
Native Dragon Balls are gigantic, huh?

135
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:28,806
The Grand Elder was quite understanding.

136
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:34,378
Oh, right, right! Bulma-<i>san</i>,
is Gohan inside the house?

137
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:38,816
I'd like to take him to the
Grand Elder's place, too.

138
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,819
He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

139
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,486
Huh?

140
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,054
It showed up on the Radar.

141
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:47,825
Remember, near that village
that Vegeta attacked?

142
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,494
Huh? Really?

143
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:53,564
A <i>Ki</i>! It's heading this way!

144
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,833
It's right next to us!

145
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,835
It's Gohan-<i>kun</i>.
That was fast, huh?

146
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:00,065
N- no, it's not Gohan!

147
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:05,067
V- Vegeta!

148
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:19,790
<i>Oh, crap! I was so ecstatic over becoming</i>
<i>stronger that I didn't notice his Ki!</i>

149
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,460
This is an unexpected place
to run into you, huh, Earthling?

150
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,362
I didn't think you guys had
the civilization it took

151
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:29,133
to make it all the way
to this planet.

152
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,703
Looking at that Dragon Ball that
you're so carefully holding onto,

153
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,365
it appears our goals are the same.

154
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:41,035
Listen, before I take that Dragon Ball from
you, there's something that I have to do.

155
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:46,817
But you'd better not get any funny ideas,
like running away with that thing.

156
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:50,719
It won't be just you- that woman
will end up dying as well.

157
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,381
He's here.

158
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,572
W- who is that?

159
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:13,844
Judging by his face, I wonder if
he isn't a champion of justice...

160
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:16,005
T- this is the worst...

161
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:21,518
<i>Once again, a battle to the death</i>
<i>was about to begin.</i>

162
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:25,682
<i>What fate will Kuririn</i>
<i>and the others meet?</i>

163
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,519
<i>And what about Goku?</i>
