1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:04,593
In the summer when I was 16,

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:06,963
I changed my brand of cigarettes
to Seven Stars.

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:09,733
Because Ren smoked them.

4
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,473
I increased the number of
piercings to match his.

5
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,613
And I wore matching boots.

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:19,423
We slept in the same bed,
and we dreamt the same dream.

7
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:24,023
Still, Ren left me behind.

8
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:29,013
Perhaps somewhere deep
in my heart,

9
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,863
I had not forgiven him for that.

10
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:37,033
The same way that I couldn't
forgive my mother.

11
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:53,753
Blinking eyes call the wind

12
00:00:53,753 --> 00:01:01,393
A smile clears all the noise away

13
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:07,963
The angel in your eyes whispers

14
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:13,143
"Everything begins now"

15
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:15,373
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

16
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:19,183
It's like being caught in a wave

17
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:21,343
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

18
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:24,813
Breath held, arms reaching out

19
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:32,053
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

20
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:36,693
You're the only one I can see

21
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:40,633
Baby my wish on a wing

22
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:43,603
This sky is torn

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:49,003
By a single overflowing word

24
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:29,813
I'm so weak.
This is already my fifth one.

25
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,683
I could only manage to quit
for three months.

26
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:36,583
But, I need something to relax me.

27
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:41,893
I wonder what happened
to Nobu after that.

28
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,893
I came down hard on him,
saying some merciless things.

29
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,903
I'll apologize to him
when I see him at work.

30
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,993
But... will he come?

31
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,473
I'm so sleepy.

32
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,313
I'm not in the mood
to go to work.

33
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,323
But I hafta make a living.

34
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,153
It does help to not hafta pay
for studio time,

35
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,263
but how much longer
is it gonna take

36
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:19,593
for things to start moving
toward our debut?

37
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,333
I wonder if Hachi's asleep.

38
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:32,403
Takumi's got recording,
so he would've left by now.

39
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:36,583
Welcome home.

40
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:48,953
Don't ignore me!

41
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,433
Come here and have a seat.

42
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,833
I have something important
to discuss with you.

43
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,003
I've gotta get changed
and go to work.

44
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,803
Then come out after
you get changed.

45
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,643
It won't take much time.

46
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:09,233
And put out that cigarette, okay?
It's bad for the baby.

47
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,413
Calm down.

48
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:20,683
I've decided to watch over Hachi gently
no matter what she decides to do.

49
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:38,903
You want something to drink?

50
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,963
We've decided to get married.

51
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:02,433
Married?

52
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,573
So, I've gotta first talk this over
with my agent

53
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,003
on how we should proceed
with this,

54
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,903
but I wanna hurry and
find a new place for her.

55
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,373
This place has no elevator,
which is hard on a pregnant woman.

56
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,453
And she has a tendency
to be careless,

57
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,183
so it's gotta be a place with security.

58
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:25,913
So, I'm sorry but...
could you find a new roommate?

59
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,263
What's that?

60
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,723
Why are things jumping forward
so quickly?

61
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,963
I wasn't even aware
that you were pregnant.

62
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,033
And what about Nobu?

63
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,203
Why are you keeping quiet?

64
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,113
I don't get it.

65
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:49,343
But sure, that's not fair to you
having her move out so suddenly,

66
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:52,683
so I'll pay half the rent until
you find a new roommate.

67
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:53,723
I don't need it!

68
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:57,283
Really? But we created
these circumstances.

69
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:58,913
Actually the timing's perfect.

70
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,223
I was planning on moving in
with Ren anyway.

71
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,793
If that's the case,
we'll just stop renting this place.

72
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,273
No wait...

73
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,273
I wanted to talk to you
about that too.

74
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,503
You need to think about
Ren's situation a bit.

75
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:18,273
Huh?

76
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:19,933
About your relationship.

77
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,953
If everything from your past
to present comes to light,

78
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:25,713
it's the kinda thing
the tabloids go after.

79
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:29,053
So what? If Trapnest is gonna fail
because of some scandal,

80
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,993
then it's not much of
a band to begin with.

81
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:36,023
No, in fact, I'm more worried
about us receiving more attention.

82
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,093
When a band becomes
as popular as ours,

83
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:43,593
the public gradually shows more interest
in things other than the band's music.

84
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:47,033
It can't be helped.
And we can take advantage of it, too.

85
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:50,813
But honestly,
I'd hate for us to be judged

86
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:54,743
because of stuff unrelated
to our music.

87
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:59,083
So I want to avoid the chance
of scandal encouraging that.

88
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,823
As someone involved
in the music business,

89
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:02,913
I'm sure you'd understand.

90
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,753
How are you okay with getting married?

91
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:11,263
Me getting married won't attract
much attention from the public.

92
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,363
I'm not nearly as recognized
as Ren.

93
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,703
Besides, I don't think

94
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,073
you wanna draw attention
in that way before your debut.

95
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,973
Of course not! I couldn't stand it.

96
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,343
Then you need to be more cautious
with your actions.

97
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,573
I'm not telling you not to see him.

98
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,113
I get it. I'll be more careful.

99
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,043
I'm glad you get it.

100
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:39,093
I tried to talk to Ren about this,
but he refuses to listen to me,

101
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,393
so it was bothering me.

102
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,193
That's all I have to talk about.
I should be heading back.

103
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,473
What's with her?

104
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,803
She's like Takumi's faithful dog.

105
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,343
I won't be able to come during
our recording...

106
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,883
but when we're done,
we'll go and meet your parents.

107
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:11,253
So don't worry unnecessarily
and get lots of rest.

108
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,883
But I don't feel that ill that
I need to stay in bed.

109
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,783
While you're away,
I'll go see a real estate agent.

110
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,823
What kinda place should
I be looking for?

111
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,923
You're even hastier than I am.

112
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,123
You that eager to play newlyweds?

113
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,403
I was just thinking
you're really busy,

114
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:28,103
so I wanted to help in
any way that I can.

115
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,973
You wanna move out fast

116
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:33,673
because you're finding it hard
to face Nana, right?

117
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:37,083
She seems to be very good friends
with Nobu,

118
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,453
so it's gotta be uncomfortable.

119
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:40,213
And she doesn't hide the fact
that she's upset about this.

120
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,383
FROM: REIRA
SUBJECT: GOOD MORNING.
I'M DONE WITH THE LYRICS.
IT'S AN INNOCENT LOVE STORY.
FROM LOVELY REIRA

121
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:48,863
I'll talk to someone at my agency
about finding a place,

122
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,093
and have him list up a few options.

123
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,233
You can go view these places
when you're feeling better

124
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,223
and decide on a place you like.

125
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,903
You're not looking as pale.
Are you feeling less nauseous?

126
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,613
Mhm. Thanks. I feel much better.

127
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,373
Takumi...

128
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,823
Shouldn't you be going
to your recording?

129
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:19,753
I still have plenty of time.

130
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:22,923
But this may not be good for
the baby in my tummy.

131
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,633
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

132
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:26,393
Nana will hear us.

133
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:27,623
Don't worry.

134
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,423
Just keep your voice down,
and she'll never notice.

135
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,233
But she's already pretty angry!

136
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:34,443
I need you to tame my anger first!

137
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:39,973
I can't stand the thought of
other guy doing it with you.

138
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:47,683
Don't you worry about a thing
and just focus on pleasing me.

139
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:52,543
The bed we got from
Mizukoshi's store was old

140
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,663
and the bedsprings would squeak.

141
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,163
It's driving me crazy.

142
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,933
You're a lot more important
to me than a boyfriend, Nana.

143
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:05,733
Liar!

144
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,833
It seems like I'm head over heels
in love with Nobu.

145
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,073
Traitor!

146
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:18,213
Could you find a new roommate?

147
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,953
Tell me that yourself!

148
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:28,563
If you don't want it,
I don't want it either.

149
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,363
I wanna use the same things you do.

150
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,793
Why don't you use
the strawberry glass?

151
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,593
Because there are only two of them.
What if I break one?

152
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:40,593
But if you don't use them,
what's the point of having them?

153
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,803
Yeah, but still, it's too sad
if one of a set breaks.

154
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:51,883
You can use it, but be sure
to be careful, okay?

155
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,033
It's too sad if one of a set breaks.

156
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,773
Nana?

157
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:49,913
Leave her alone.

158
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:52,903
Good...

159
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:55,843
They're together.

160
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,013
I'm not sad anymore.

161
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:19,463
Huh?

162
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,243
When did she get here?

163
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,653
A ring of oath

164
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,643
Our red string
We can't see it now

165
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,223
No promises either

166
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:44,063
What part of this is
an innocent love story?

167
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:46,253
It seems to me more like
a song about infidelity.

168
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:46,853
Huh?!

169
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,963
Huh? But there's no ring of oath, right?

170
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,433
Yes, but you could interpret this

171
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,303
as the other guy having
a ring on his finger.

172
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:53,303
Huh?!

173
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:56,513
You know, you've been acting
awfully suspicious lately, Reira.

174
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,033
Are you having an affair?

175
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:00,403
That's not what it means!

176
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,703
But songs about infidelity
sell pretty well!

177
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,913
But it's not like that, Mari!
This is about pure love!

178
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,883
A love that binds people together!
But one where you don't even kiss!

179
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,583
Speaking of ring of oath, Take...

180
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:12,243
Hm?

181
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,623
I'm getting married.

182
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:14,783
- Huh?!
- It's all right, isn't it?

183
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,053
- You're getting married?!
- You're getting married?!

184
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,193
What are you saying all
of a sudden, Takumi?

185
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,823
And to say it here?

186
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,933
I trust the staff members here.

187
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,373
I-I-I need an explanation!

188
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:26,063
Huh?

189
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,503
You getting married is
even less likely

190
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:30,273
than this single selling
ten million copies!

191
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:32,503
My woman's pregnant.

192
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,203
Hachiko?!

193
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:34,603
You sure know a lot.

194
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,843
It's not like you, Takumi.
It's not like you!

195
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,873
It's not Nobu's baby?

196
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,483
Why would you fall for
Hachiko's tactics so easily like that?!

197
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:45,453
Tactics?

198
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:46,663
Hachiko's objectives are
to earn

199
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:48,623
the status of being the wife of
a popular musician and your money!

200
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,893
She may have even lured you
into doing it when she was ovulating!

201
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,703
TAKUMI

202
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:53,563
TAKUMI
Takumi, I wanna see you!

203
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:54,663
COME INSIDE ME.
(SHE NEVER SAID THAT.)
I WANNA SEE YOU!
Takumi, I wanna see you!

204
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:55,063
COME INSIDE ME.
(SHE NEVER SAID THAT.)
I WANNA SEE YOU!

205
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,163
No, I doubt it was something
she did on purpose.

206
00:13:59,643 --> 00:14:00,173
But her objectives may be as you say.

207
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,743
I DID COME OUTSIDE.
But her objectives may be as you say.

208
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:02,073
I DID COME OUTSIDE.
Are you fine with
a loveless relationship?!

209
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,303
Are you fine with
a loveless relationship?!

210
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,573
Love comes later.

211
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:10,403
People love themselves more
than anyone else.

212
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,783
They end up loving those who
can fulfill the most desires they have.

213
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:15,993
In a way, that's the truth.

214
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:17,123
HIDEKI KASAI (45)
DIRECTOR
In a way, that's the truth.

215
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:17,893
HIDEKI KASAI (45)
DIRECTOR
Huh?!

216
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,683
Why not?
Let them get married, Take.

217
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,733
Why don't we see where
a relationship

218
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,493
between a bastard and
a fad follower will take them?

219
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:26,763
This could be fun.

220
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,753
Easy for you to say.

221
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,973
Anyway, we must discuss this
with the president.

222
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,093
Until we do, please,
everyone, keep this a secret.

223
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,343
What a pain.

224
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,033
Let me do as I wish!
It's my marriage!

225
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,303
Well then, let's get started
with the recording.

226
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,843
Huh? Where's Reira?

227
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,213
She was here until a moment ago.

228
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:44,903
I'm sure she'll be right back.

229
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,383
We record the vocals later anyway.

230
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,913
We can do it without
temporary vocals.

231
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,793
Mari, could you please
go look for her?

232
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:55,653
Yes.

233
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,103
What? Reira's your real name?

234
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:11,473
Mhm. Well, almost.
It's spelled L-A-Y-L-A.

235
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,943
You know the Eric Clapton song, "Layla"?

236
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,083
Yeah. It's a famous song.

237
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,813
My father loved that song,
so he named me after it.

238
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:23,693
Even now when I'm alone
in my room,

239
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:27,593
I play that CD
and I don't feel alone.

240
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,523
"Lovely Layla."

241
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:33,623
The Japanese title is different...

242
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:36,223
That'll be 5,500 yen.

243
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,143
I'll be in touch.

244
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:07,263
Yes?

245
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,363
Hello?

246
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,403
Hello?

247
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:17,403
Shin, .,

248
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,503
What's the matter?

249
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,773
Where are you now, Reira?
What about the recording?

250
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,483
Did something happen?

251
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,293
Reira, are you all right?

252
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,553
Please do me a favor.

253
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,293
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,033
Just tell me what it is.
I'll do anything.

255
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,863
I don't need any more money.

256
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:54,573
Yasu, .,

257
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:55,373
Huh?

258
00:16:58,653 --> 00:16:59,273
What?

259
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,393
Please give me Yasu's cell number.

260
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:36,783
Hello...

261
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:41,113
Nana?! What the hell are you doing?!
You had me worried!

262
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:42,313
Nobu?

263
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:43,923
I called you a number of times
since this morning,

264
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,013
but you didn't pick up!

265
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:47,683
I was panicking a bit last night
and said some mean things.

266
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:51,163
But I'm the one this is happening to
and went to work today,

267
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,563
so how dare you take the day off!

268
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,953
I'm starting to hate myself
for being so damn responsible.

269
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:57,393
MISSED CALL NOBUO
MISSED CALL NOBUO
MISSED CALL NOBUO

270
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,573
Ah, sorry.

271
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:01,903
Never mind.

272
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:05,503
I'm used to your merciless oppression,

273
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,733
and I covered for you at work.

274
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:09,243
Where are you now?

275
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,553
At Ren's... place?

276
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,213
I'm guessing Ren's not there
because of work, right?

277
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,363
I'm done with work today.

278
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:25,353
What do you say we grab a bite
to eat before going to the studio?

279
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,593
Nobuo, .,

280
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,033
My treat! You've gotta let me
spill out my sad story!

281
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,633
I'm thinking, there really is
something wrong with me.

282
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,833
I already know that, from long ago!

283
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:40,033
I can't remember why I'm here.

284
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:42,743
Am I still only half awake?

285
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:59,323
The last thing I remember was the
strawberry glass about to roll off the table.

286
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:08,703
Those matching glasses were
the first things we bought together...

287
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:14,503
Was I able to catch that glass...

288
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,743
before it fell?

289
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,033
You know, Hachi...

290
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:39,233
I was too small of a person

291
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,033
to be able to accept everything
about you.

292
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,773
I was like a cheap glass.

293
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:50,843
It's just that I preferred the pain
of breaking into pieces,

294
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,023
to the loneliness I felt
from losing everything.

295
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,453
LOVELY LAYLA
to the loneliness I felt
from losing everything.

296
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:56,583
LOVELY LAYLA

297
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:02,493
I was just too fragile.

298
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,733
It's not your fault.

299
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:15,203
I can't count
how many nights

300
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:19,973
I wished tomorrow
would never come

301
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:26,743
To live as I am
without being fake

302
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:30,343
What do I need

303
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:38,493
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

304
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:43,663
The answer is
too close to see

305
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:49,903
Black tears are
falling down

306
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:56,843
I have nothing,
only sadness

307
00:21:56,913 --> 00:22:01,943
I can't put it
into words

308
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:08,013
My whole body
starts to ache

309
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:13,433
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
