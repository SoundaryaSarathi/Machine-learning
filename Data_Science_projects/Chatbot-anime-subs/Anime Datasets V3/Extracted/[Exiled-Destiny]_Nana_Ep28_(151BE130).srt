1
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,189
We kissed, held hands,

2
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:23,669
and walked to the convenience store
without saying a word.

3
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:42,919
Blinking eyes call the wind

4
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:50,569
A smile clears all the noise away

5
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:57,129
The angel in your eyes whispers

6
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:02,309
"Everything begins now"

7
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,549
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

8
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:08,349
It's like being caught in a wave

9
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,519
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

10
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,989
Breath held, arms reaching out

11
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:21,229
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

12
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,869
You're the only one I can see

13
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,799
Baby my wish on a wing

14
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,769
This sky is torn

15
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:38,179
By a single overflowing word

16
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,579
His hand is so warm.
Just like Nana's.

17
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,349
I don't ever wanna
let go of this hand.

18
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,189
What do I need to do to have him
understand this feeling?

19
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,629
I'm the girl who could not send
Takumi back that time

20
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,039
when Nobu was with me.

21
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:44,249
No matter what I say, I feel like he's not
gonna believe me at this point.

22
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,179
But the truth is, I've been holding back
the whole time.

23
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,919
I wanted to become Nobu's girlfriend.
I wanted to touch him.

24
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,519
I had secretly been wishing

25
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,859
for the day when he would
hold me in his arms

26
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,989
as we'd walk this path
along the river.

27
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,909
What expression do
you have right now,

28
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,339
and what are you thinking?

29
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,909
I'm too scared to find out.

30
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,219
It's okay if you wanna take me
away somewhere.

31
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,119
But what if he then thinks
I could easily fall for a guy

32
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,219
even though I have a boyfriend,
and ends up seriously hating me?

33
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,829
What's with all this boring talk, baldy?

34
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,509
We just have to sell records, right?

35
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,979
That's no big deal at all.

36
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,679
Hurry up and tell Kawano
to have the contract ready.

37
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,749
Got it? Answer me.

38
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:57,839
Okay.

39
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,109
Man, this is really making me sleepy.

40
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,879
I'm so sleepy, I could go bald.

41
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,129
I'm taking a bath and going to bed.

42
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,589
Huh? Aren't you gonna stay up
until Hachiko returns?

43
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,489
She won't be coming back.
I win the bet.

44
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,459
I bet one hundred yen that
he'll come before they even do it!

45
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,769
But Miss Hachiko has a boyfriend.

46
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,739
Well, if I can't stay at Nobu's place,

47
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,779
I guess I'll just go back
to my parent's place tonight.

48
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,409
Your parent's place?

49
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:27,139
Oh, hello, Ryoko? Working hard?

50
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,879
I'm sorry for not contacting you
until now.

51
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,749
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm coming over now, okay?

52
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,819
Well, see ya, Misato.

53
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,289
Huh?! You're leaving?!
What about the wine?

54
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,089
Wait, Shin!

55
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,359
Who's Ryoko?

56
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,099
She raised me.

57
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,499
Liar. I know you don't have a mother.

58
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,629
How do you know that?

59
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,969
If you don't want people
finding out about you,

60
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,529
at least be smart enough to
use an alias.

61
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,709
Lately, I haven't told anyone
my full name.

62
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,539
Not that I care if people find out,

63
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,949
but I don't like people snooping around.

64
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,119
Then don't do things to
make people worry.

65
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:15,189
You can put up a front as you like,
but you're still a fifteen-year-old kid.

66
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,989
You'll need a guardian to
sign on your behalf

67
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,729
on the record contract.

68
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,729
If you don't wanna see him,
I'll go and get that signature for you.

69
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,869
I'm counting on you, Yasu.

70
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,249
Misato, I'm going home, too.

71
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:43,249
Huh?

72
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,589
Sorry, I've got a lot of work to do.

73
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,089
That's fine. I don't mind, but...

74
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,329
Does that mean you've accepted defeat
in that bet you made?

75
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,959
Hachiko already has a boyfriend,
so are you all right with that?

76
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,359
Or rather, is Nobu all right with that?

77
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,109
I dunno. Well, a man becomes weak
toward the woman he loves,

78
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:04,579
but I just can't understand what goes on
in the complicated mind of a woman.

79
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,739
In other words,
it's a complicated situation, isn't it?

80
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,249
I'm sorry.
I'll try to be more discreet.

81
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,259
You'll be here until the end of
summer vacation, right, Misato?

82
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,489
Are your parents okay with that?

83
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,029
Yes. There's no need to worry.

84
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:25,289
Can I ask you a personal question?

85
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:26,629
What is it?

86
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:30,099
Misato Uehara.
What's your real name?

87
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,909
It's a secret.

88
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,009
It really was a fake name.

89
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,809
And she's such a nice girl.

90
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:47,989
I really can't understand women.
Man, oh man...

91
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:55,549
Huh?

92
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:01,789
Oh, there she is.

93
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:10,469
2001 FIREWORKS DISPLAY
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22ND
TAMAGAWA RIVERBED
19:00 to 20:45

94
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,679
They're having fireworks!

95
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,569
It's close by.

96
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,019
Wanna go together?

97
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,389
I'll carry one.

98
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,479
It's okay.

99
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:33,399
Actually, carry one.

100
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:45,669
How can you tell?

101
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,179
Huh? Tell what?

102
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,909
What I'm thinking.

103
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,819
I can't tell.

104
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,579
I kinda feel a connection.

105
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,649
Really?

106
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,719
I'm feeling awkward not having
a clue what you're getting at,

107
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,489
so if possible, I'd like you
to explain it to me.

108
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,529
Telepathy?

109
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,719
Listen to what I'm saying.

110
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,729
Sorry, I have a tendency to
get carried away.

111
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:08,429
No, it's ok. Actually I find that
dreamy side of you quite attractive.

112
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:10,299
Is he disappointed?
What should I do?

113
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,359
Say, that method you use
where you seem interested,

114
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,409
and then you pull back.

115
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,029
Is that a trap to get a man
to fall for you?

116
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:16,739
No!

117
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:18,599
You seem carefree,
but you're really cunning.

118
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,309
You're wrong!

119
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,179
What a terrible woman.
Did the Demon Lord send you?

120
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,179
That's why you talk passionately
about him like some missionary!

121
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:23,879
That's not true!

122
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,449
You said so yourself,
that you're a horrible woman...

123
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,319
I was joking, don't cry!

124
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:35,489
I'm sorry.
I'll break it off with Takumi.

125
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:42,599
I really didn't want anyone to know
about what happened with Takumi.

126
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,199
I thought, then I could act like
nothing happened and

127
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:47,829
become your girlfriend.

128
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:53,039
I had such cunning thoughts.
Lots of them.

129
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,609
Are you disappointed?

130
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,079
No. I'm happy.

131
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,279
Stop staring at me
with those teary eyes.

132
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,829
I won't be able to hold back.

133
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,839
I can't take you from him by force.

134
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,069
I can't have you do something
that'll make you a horrible woman.

135
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,899
If we let things get outta control now,

136
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,609
you'll end up being trapped
between Takumi and me,

137
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,649
and you'll suffer.

138
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,479
Because you're kind and fragile.

139
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:38,519
I don't find you cunning.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

140
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,929
It can't be helped that
you're attracted to Takumi.

141
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:45,659
No matter how hard I try,

142
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,759
I'll probably never be able
to compete with him.

143
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:49,859
That's not true! I!

144
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,059
But if you tell me that

145
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,839
you're still gonna break it off with him
and be my woman...

146
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,979
I'll do everything I can
to make you happy.

147
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:08,389
For the sake of your happiness,
I will do everything within my power.

148
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,349
Am I dreaming?

149
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,319
I mean, with you by my side,
I feel like I can do anything.

150
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,599
But it's a dream that
I won't wake up from.

151
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,899
When you break up with Takumi...

152
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:31,409
and sort out your feelings...
then come to me.

153
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,479
I'll be waiting faithfully.

154
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:45,089
Hey, Nana, I've fallen in love
many times to this day,

155
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,029
but I never imagined that
a man existed in real life

156
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,499
that would say those things
and mean it.

157
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,699
What words has Ren given you so far?
I wanna talk to you, Nana.

158
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,969
Welcome back, Miss Hachiko.

159
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,919
Sorry for getting back so late.

160
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:13,189
It's okay.

161
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,379
Actually, you're early.

162
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:16,819
Are you alone?

163
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,359
Huh? Where are Shin and Yasu?

164
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,989
Oh, they went home already.

165
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,029
What the heck?!
And I bought all this for them!

166
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,499
I'm sorry.
Let's save that for the next party.

167
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,759
By the way, where's Nobu?

168
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,439
He walked me here,

169
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:33,999
but he said he was going home
because he has to work tomorrow.

170
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,609
Is that so?

171
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,869
So, something did happen?

172
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,209
Then I guess we can call it a day.

173
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:42,109
I'm working from
the morning tomorrow, too.

174
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,619
Do you mind if I take a bath first?

175
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,379
Oh! Nana's in there right now.

176
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,019
I figured you would barge in here.

177
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,319
You've gotta do something
about that hobby of yours to peep.

178
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:54,949
Nana.

179
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:03,229
Don't get in!
What the hell are you thinking?!

180
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,189
What's the big deal?
We're both girls.

181
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,209
I'm not into taking baths
with other women!

182
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,329
So you would with a man?

183
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,469
That's normal.

184
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,699
It's usually the other way around.

185
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,639
Besides, it would be one thing
to share a bath with a human girl,

186
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,149
but this is a female dog that
just got back from a walk.

187
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,179
Wait, Nana.

188
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,679
Listen. It's about Nobu.

189
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,349
What about Nobuo?

190
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,129
He asked me to go see
the fireworks with him.

191
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:43,639
Then go.

192
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,249
Is he still in elementary school?!
He's useless! That man's got no balls!

193
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,849
In any case, Yasu won the bet.
No wonder he's the leader.

194
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,649
He knows everything
about his band members.

195
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,019
I think I'll wait until after
I break up with Takumi before I tell Nana.

196
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,229
She arranged for me to meet
with Takumi,

197
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,699
and cheered me on hoping
the relationship would succeed.

198
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,219
I'm sure she'll be like, "What the hell?!"

199
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,899
If I were in Nana's shoes,
that's what I would think.

200
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:16,209
Not only Nana.
Everyone would think that.

201
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,989
I'll say goodbye to him over the phone.

202
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:44,539
I don't wanna see his face
when he gets hurt. He's so full of pride.

203
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,949
Over the past few days,

204
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,639
these mosquitoes have taken
a liking to my place.

205
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,679
They're so annoying.

206
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,449
Huh?! Your place too, Takumi?
Darn.

207
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:00,119
I was all excited because it was like
I was the only celebrity.

208
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,149
Nothing to be excited about!

209
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,619
Mosquitoes?
It's summer, after all.

210
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,519
For real, Reira?

211
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,649
They're at my place, too.
The paparazzi.

212
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,289
I wonder whose blood
they wanna suck.

213
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,599
Then they must be at my place, too.
This is bad.

214
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:14,729
It's your blood they want.

215
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,799
Oh, that's right.

216
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,659
You've got a woman staying
at your place, don't you Ren?

217
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,269
Make her go home before
they find out.

218
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,469
We can't afford any scandals
with you in it.

219
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,839
What's wrong with that?

220
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,149
"Ren Honjo's passionate
love life uncovered!"

221
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,319
It's not gonna hurt you, right?
In fact, it's adorable.

222
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,579
I'll tell her to dress properly
whenever she goes out.

223
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,719
By the way, when can
we return to our homes

224
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,719
where the mosquitoes wait for us?

225
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,989
Then go home. Our band will be
just fine without you, Naoki.

226
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,499
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
COULD YOU CALL ME
WHEN YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
AT A BUSY TIME. NANA

227
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,079
You didn't have to
respond so quickly.

228
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,689
Hello?

229
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:08,939
What did you wanna talk
to me about?

230
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,789
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

231
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,119
The phone won't do.

232
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,529
I can't say "goodbye"
over the phone.

233
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,899
It's inhumane.

234
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,429
Can we meet now and talk?

235
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,769
Sorry. We're filming
a TV show right now.

236
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,139
Oh, is that so?
Sorry to bug you during work.

237
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,409
It's okay. We spend more time
waiting than shooting.

238
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,739
It's such a drag.

239
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,539
That's rare for you to be on TV.

240
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,649
Satellite TV.
They're doing a special on us.

241
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,189
Really? But we don't have
a tuner at home.

242
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,719
If you're a fan, then buy one.

243
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,559
This isn't good. This is no time
to be chatting casually.

244
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,829
What's the matter? Is it something you
can't discuss over the phone?

245
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,969
I'm fully booked for a while,
and I can't make any plans.

246
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:00,799
I see...

247
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,599
What? Don't tell me you're pregnant!

248
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,079
Huh?! No, that's not it!

249
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,679
So that's not it. Thank goodness.
You scared me there.

250
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,139
I may not look it,
but I'm pretty sensitive.

251
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,349
I don't deal well with
inconveniences like that.

252
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:17,849
Sorry.

253
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,289
Inconvenience?

254
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,629
Who talks like that?!

255
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,959
Tossing aside his responsibilities
like it's the normal thing to do!

256
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,289
There's something wrong with him
as a human being!

257
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,929
And why am I apologizing?!

258
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,099
We're up.

259
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,599
Sorry, I'll have to go now.

260
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:36,769
I'll call you when I have some time.

261
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,009
You don't have to!

262
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,679
In fact, don't ever call me again!

263
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:41,609
Goodbye!

264
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,879
I told him. I was able to tell him!

265
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,729
It's over.

266
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,229
Nana seems pissed off with me.

267
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,869
Huh? Nana? Oh, you mean Hachiko.
I can see why she's pissed off.

268
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,569
"Don't tell me you're pregnant!"

269
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,399
"You scared me there.
An inconvenience."

270
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,909
And you say you're sensitive?

271
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,839
You don't even have
an ounce of sensitivity.

272
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,309
But it would really be a problem,
so I had to tell her.

273
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,809
Besides, she'd be the one
most troubled by it.

274
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:21,909
If you think so, then I suggest you come up
with a proper and bright family plan.

275
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,049
You're one to talk.

276
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,249
It's not a problem with me.

277
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:27,549
In fact, I would love to start
a bright family.

278
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,989
But she's on the pill again.
Such a dark woman.

279
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,529
So it's all about what you want.

280
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,239
He's not calling back.

281
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,739
How come?
That's so anti-climactic.

282
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,149
Why was I clinging onto such
a loveless man?

283
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,449
It's like a love that lasted
one hundred years

284
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,489
coming to an abrupt end.

285
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:56,819
Wait a minute.

286
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,949
I knew from the start that
Takumi had no love in him.

287
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:05,389
There's no way Takumi would
be hurt by what I say.

288
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,529
I've awakened from
a hundred-year sleep. That's all.

289
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:11,969
Every time we meet,

290
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,199
we get under the covers
and he tells me sweet nothings.

291
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:17,639
Whenever we held each other tight,

292
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:21,009
I vaguely had this vision that
a day will come when this will turn to love.

293
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:28,979
Still that was nothing but an illusion.
I have finally awakened to the truth.

294
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,219
I'll be waiting faithfully.

295
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,229
The kiss of a real prince
has awakened me.

296
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,099
PRINCE

297
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,869
Although he doesn't really strike me
as the prince type.

298
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,939
But never mind that.

299
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:53,279
You surprised me!

300
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,969
Sorry to bother you at work.
Nana told me where you work.

301
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,949
So you work in a record store.

302
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:00,979
Come to think of it,

303
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,989
you've got a lot of records
at your place, too.

304
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,719
Actually, I only work here
twice a week.

305
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:07,549
Other days, I have short term jobs,
and other stuff.

306
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:10,519
I see. By the way,
what time do you get off today?

307
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:11,629
At nine.

308
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,789
Then I'll wait for you until then
at the café next door.

309
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,499
Come to think of it,

310
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,029
there are many things that
I don't know about Nobu yet.

311
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,869
I want to learn everything about him.

312
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,809
But I'll bet his blood type is A.

313
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,209
Since he's basically a serious person.

314
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,949
Darn it. I'm feeling restless.

315
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,029
Hi there!

316
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,289
Stop startling me!

317
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,959
Hey Nobu, are you hungry?

318
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,599
I came directly after work,
so I haven't eaten anything either.

319
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,369
Oh? Then let's have dinner somewhere.

320
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:56,129
Actually, I wanna go to your place
and make something!

321
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,179
Huh? My place?

322
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,309
- No good!
- Why not?

323
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,639
I told you yesterday.

324
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,509
Put an end to things first,
and then come to me.

325
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,649
But I did. That's why I came.

326
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,689
Too fast!

327
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:09,189
I'm sorry. But I was holding back
all day today.

328
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:12,019
The day seemed like a year to me.

329
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,299
It might've felt like a year to you,
but one day is still one day.

330
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,089
Then I'll try and wait for one more day.

331
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,659
Do you know how to make nikujaga?

332
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:22,699
It's my specialty!

333
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:26,729
She's so cute! Let's just pretend
that a year has passed.

334
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,469
Where's Hachiko?

335
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,339
She said she may not be
coming home today.

336
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:32,569
I got an email from her.

337
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:34,609
You think she's at
her boyfriend's place again?

338
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,939
What? But I thought they're filming
until midnight.

339
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,449
TELL ME WHERE NOBU WORKS!
HACHIKO

340
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:45,959
Hey, Nana...

341
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:50,859
What words of love
has Ren given you?

342
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:57,299
I should've asked you then.
I should've found out.

343
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:04,239
That claw-foot bathtub
isn't here anymore.

344
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:12,439
I reached into the sky

345
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:18,959
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

346
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,329
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

347
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:30,329
Like colorful balloons

348
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,439
I'm alone

349
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,169
My hand had no place to go

350
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:42,809
And gently you took it

351
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:43,979
Starless night

352
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:48,179
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

353
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,989
I want to feel your warmth

354
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,859
Tears are falling down

355
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,959
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

356
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:06,459
Of your hand holding mine
