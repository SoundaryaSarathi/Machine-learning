00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,670
"An Explosion of Anger!!
Goku, Avenge Everyone's Deaths"

2
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,480
W- What's with his transformation?

3
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,980
Saiyans are only supposed
to turn into great apes.

4
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,480
W- What does this mean?

5
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,670
Quickly, Gohan. If Piccolo dies, Kami-sama dies too.
You must know what that would mean.

6
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,780
- Father!
- Don't concern yourself about me! I will
be sure to return to Earth later!

7
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,780
B- But how will you? If we take your
spaceship back...

8
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,790
Don't argue! Do you want to annoy me!?

9
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,460
Father...

10
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,820
Thank you! Thank you, Father!

11
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,770
I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting for you
to appear in good shape, Father!

12
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,440
There's no way I'm letting
you get away like that.

13
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,300
Enough is enough, you scumbag!

14
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,590
You've killed so many blameless
people, one after the other...

15
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,100
You even killed Kuririn... !

16
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,470
W- Why do you have this kind of power?

17
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,420
Don't tell me... don't tell me you're... !

18
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,030
Father, I understood! What Vegeta
was saying is true, isn't it?

19
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,440
Father, you've become one. A Super Saiyan!

20
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,120
That's strange...

21
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,130
There aren't any malfunctions anywhere.

22
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,370
Aren't you done fixin' it yet!?

23
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,810
While we're here doin' this, Gohan-chan's
growin' more and more delinquent!

24
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,830
What's the matter, ol' timer?

25
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
You've got such a serious look on yer mug.

26
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,850
I want to go see Gohan now!

27
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,350
It's nothing. I just had a strange,
uneasy feeling is all.

28
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,860
'Bout what?

29
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,360
Goku. I'm worried that as a result of his getting so
strong, he's become a double-edged sword.

30
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,860
What're you talkin' 'bout?

31
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:15,370
A double-edged sword can deliver a powerful
blow to an opponent, but it can also deliver
the same kind of blow the other way.

32
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,140
Yeah, what about it?

33
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:28,820
What about it? Up until now, he's fought
so many powerful opponents, one after
another. As a result, he's gotten so strong.

34
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,160
But supposing this Freeza guy turns out to
have the ultimate in strength...

35
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,160
Supposin' he does?

36
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,830
As he fights against someone his
equal, Goku just might...

37
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,830
Ah, on the other hand, maybe I'm
worrying unnecessarily.

38
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,850
I...

39
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,520
I...

40
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,470
I am furious with you, Freeza!

41
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,170
You talk like you're so self-important.

42
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,680
You say I've killed the blameless?

43
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,450
Are you trying to say that what you
Saiyans have done up to now was so right?

44
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,110
That's why we were destroyed.

45
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,630
I'm the one who destroyed you.

46
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,790
All of you of monkeys got on my nerves.

47
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,800
And now I'm going to destroy you.

48
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,800
Me, Freeza-sama?

49
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,480
Don't let things go to your head.
There's no way you can win.

50
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,610
Even supposing you were a Super Saiyan.

51
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
Father...

52
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,780
I ain't forgiving you, even if you apologize.

53
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,110
Dammit!

54
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,070
Y- You dodged it! T- There's no
way you could have!

55
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,810
W- Why you... !

56
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,820
If only I could hit you, you'd be... !

57
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,540
Hit me and see.

58
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,840
W- What did you... ?

59
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,170
Mock me, will you!?

60
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,790
You can destroy whole planets, but it seems
you can't even destroy a single man, huh?

61
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,170
W- Wh- What the hell are you!?

62
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,130
As you are surely well aware...

63
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,150
I am the Saiyan who came from
Earth to defeat you.

64
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,160
Despite my calm, quiet heart, I am the legendary
warrior, awakened by intense anger.

65
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,180
I am the Super Saiyan, Son Goku!!

66
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,790
The transcendent power of a Super Saiyan!

67
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,120
Goku, now is the time to avenge everyone!

68
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:46,120
