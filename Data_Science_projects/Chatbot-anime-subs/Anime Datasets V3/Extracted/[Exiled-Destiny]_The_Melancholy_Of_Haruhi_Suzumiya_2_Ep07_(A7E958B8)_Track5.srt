1
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:17,641
The score still seven to zero at the top of
the seventh. The third batter is Yamada.

2
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,121
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.
Something seems off.

3
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:20,221
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.

4
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,291
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.
It just somehow
felt that way.

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:22,391
It just somehow
felt that way.

6
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:23,321
There's the first pitch.
It's a ball.
It just somehow

7
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,131
There's the first pitch.
It's a ball.

00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:25,491
There's the first pitch.
It's a ball.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:25,591
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

10
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:28,501
Kumamoto's pitcher, Suzuki,
had started the game
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

11
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:28,601
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

12
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:29,361
having already pitched
fourteen innings.

14
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,171
Having already pitched

But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

15
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:31,471
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

16
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,201
What an incredible spirit, he's able to
keep going despite giving up seven runs.
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

17
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,541
The second pitch is...
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

18
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,441
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

19
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,171
And it's up... a left fly ball.
One out.
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that

And it's up... a left fly ball.
One out.

21
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:41,941
What does she want?

22
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,081
The gap between the
scores is big,
What does she want?

23
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,181
The gap between the
scores is big,

24
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,051
The gap between the
scores is big,
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

25
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:44,151
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

26
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:45,151
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

27
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:45,211
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

28
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,421
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

29
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,011
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

30
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,251
The passionate voices cheering from the
third base bleachers have not died down.

31
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:51,921
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

32
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,091
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
You're not doing anything today, right?
We're meeting at 2PM in front of the station.

33
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:55,191
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

34
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,361
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
Be sure to show up.

35
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:56,791
Be sure to show up.

36
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,881
That's true.

37
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,831
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.

38
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,231
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.
I didn't even say anything...

39
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,091
Right.

40
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:05,971
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

41
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,101
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.
- What?
- I forgot to mention this...

42
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:08,201
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

Bring a swimsuit

Bring a swimsuit

45
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,741
After last year's summer tournament, he
was chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

48
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:12,771
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

49
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,981
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

50
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,171
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

51
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:19,011
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

52
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,111
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

53
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,311
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

55
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,651
That was a good pitch.

56
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:22,381
That was a good pitch.
No, not quite.

57
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:22,481
No, not quite.

58
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,021
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
No, not quite.

59
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,091
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

60
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,851
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
To be precise, it felt like this exact same
conversation had happened before.

61
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:25,951
To be precise, it felt like this exact same
conversation had happened before.

62
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:28,681
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
To be precise, it felt like this exact same
conversation had happened before.

63
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,121
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...

64
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,821
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

65
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:36,061
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...

66
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,601
And it's good!

67
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,631
It's a single-run home run!
Summer's almost over.

Yeah, yeah.
Sorry I made you wait.

Yeah, yeah.
Sorry I made you wait.

89
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,561
- Okay, we're all here, so let's go.
- Where are we going?

90
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,631
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

91
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,271
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

92
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,881
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

93
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,281
We can never get back the time
that we've lost!

94
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,851
And so we're going to do them now, in our
one and only summer as tenth graders.

95
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,881
By the way, we're going
to the pool by bike.

96
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,991
Did you ride your
bikes, too?

97
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,621
No, the only two bikes we have
are yours and mine.

98
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,561
Kyon, you'd better not lose
to Koizumi.

99
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,601
This train is leaving
the station!

100
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,271
Hurry up and park your bikes,
you two.

101
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,771
Kyon, we're about to go have fun.
This is no time to be exhausted.

102
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,041
Whose fault do you think
this is?

103
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:07,041
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

104
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,471
That's a lot of people.

105
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,051
Come on, let's find a place to put our stuff
and get swimming!

106
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,651
We're going to race!

107
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,861
- Come on, Mikuru!
- Okay!

108
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:18,321
No diving
It's dangerous!

109
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,091
Hurry up and get in! The water's warm
so it feels fine!

110
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,321
Can't she read the "no diving" signs
posted everywhere?

111
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,531
That looks like fun.

112
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:32,331
This makes me smile, though.
It feels peaceful.

113
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:38,341
She has some rather normal ways of
enjoying her time, don't you think?

114
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,281
Calling out of the blue to invite someone
out to do something and only giving

115
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,411
a general idea of what's going to
happen isn't what I'd call "normal".

116
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,521
In my opinion,
that's really nothing.

117
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,561
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

118
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,491
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

119
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,801
I hope that's the case...

120
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,431
All right!

121
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,801
What's wrong?

122
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,771
It's nothing. It's probably
just my imagination.

123
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,931
Because so much has happened
since the beginning of spring,

124
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,241
I've become a
little paranoid.

125
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,021
Here you are.

126
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,961
Thank you.

127
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,421
It's delicious.

128
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,061
All right, let's go swim
some more!

129
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,061
Jeez.

130
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:40,871
I think it would be better to call this place
a communal pool than a public pool.

131
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,441
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

132
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,851
There it is again.

133
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,911
It feels like I've seen
this scene once before.

134
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:57,121
Where Nagato kind of looks
like she's bored...

135
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,721
Kyon!

136
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:02,391
Right, and then Haruhi
says this...

137
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:04,501
These two are my
brigade members.

138
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:07,231
They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!

139
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,201
Okay, let's have some fun!
We're going to play water soccer.

140
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,701
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,431
Well, deja vu isn't
all that uncommon.

142
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,611
Here we go, Mikuru!

143
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:26,051
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival,
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...

144
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,781
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival,
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...
I thought about what we'll be doing
from here on. What do you think?

145
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,561
What is that?

146
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:35,291
It's a schedule of how we'll spend
the rest of our short summer vacation.

147
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:40,361
I realized that we only have
two weeks of summer vacation left.

148
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,591
That fact
blew me away.

149
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:48,681
We still have so much left to do, but
we've only got this much time left!

150
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,841
We're going to pick up
the pace!

151
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:53,171
All this in just
two weeks?

152
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,841
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

153
00:06:56,381 --> 00:07:00,121
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

154
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:04,381
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

155
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,061
Pardon me
for a moment.

156
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,291
Thank you.

157
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:16,261
Is there a place nearby
that's having a Bon festival?

158
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,571
- I'll check around.
- Please do.

159
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,701
We're starting tomorrow.

160
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,641
We're done for today!

161
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,851
Nagato!

162
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,791
Umm... no, it's
nothing important.

163
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:40,551
How have you been?
Everything fine?

164
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,221
Fine.

165
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,531
T-That's good to hear.

166
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,971
Right.

167
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:56,601
What the heck?
Why did I talk to her?

168
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,891
You can go now.

169
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,801
The next morning, it was a call from
Haruhi that awoke me from my slumber.

170
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,961
They found a place that was
holding a Bon festival.

171
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,071
We're all going to
go buy yukata!

172
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,071
Both Mikuru and Yuki said that
they don't own a yukata.

173
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,111
I don't own one either, and there's a place
selling them in sets for cheap! Let's go!

174
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,101
Haruhi entered a women's
clothing outlet store.

175
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,611
She just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

176
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,011
...and then headed straight
for the changing rooms.

177
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:37,351
They made us wait
for about an hour.

178
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,441
Ta-dah!
They made us wait
for about an hour.

179
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,081
Whoa, how blinding!

180
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,851
You all look wonderful.

181
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,691
Of course! I chose
these yukata, after all.

182
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,291
Especially Mikuru!

183
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:50,231
It's so cute on you! Just what you
would expect from my choice!

184
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,191
O-Of course.

185
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,561
Miss Asahina!

186
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:00,701
They have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

187
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,601
Be sure to catch
a bunch!

188
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,611
A Bon festival, huh?

189
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:07,611
I guess it makes sense for there
to be this many people.

190
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:14,681
It's been a while since I've come to one,
but it feels like I have recently.

191
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,981
That tower,
those vendors...

192
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:23,991
Shall we play, too?
How about a competition?

193
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,861
Leave it to me!

194
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,561
I'll pass.

195
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,131
What about you, Nagato?
Want to eat something?

196
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,641
You're interested
in that stuff?

197
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,651
- Which one?
- It's all right.

198
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,291
- This one.
- Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.

199
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,791
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

200
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:58,061
so I thought it would be appropriate
for me to at least buy her that, but...

201
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,001
Wow, what a haul!
Thirteen!

202
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:05,231
But I don't need so many,
so I just kept one.

203
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,001
And one
for Mikuru, too.

204
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,511
You can have one,
but only one.

205
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,511
Thanks.

206
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:20,351
What's with the mask,
Yuki?

207
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,851
I bought it.

208
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,761
Huh. I see.

209
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:28,791
Now then, next up is fireworks! Let's
launch some fireworks to end the day!

210
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:32,021
Fancy Fireworks Set
Don't you understand the meaning
of the word "moderation"?

211
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,861
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

212
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,871
That's why I wanted
to forget about it,

213
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:44,741
but there was one thing
lingering in my mind.

214
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:48,181
Tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

215
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,571
Haruhi.

216
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,191
It's fine to want to play around, but are you
finished with your summer homework?

217
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,521
What? You can finish homework
like that in just three days.

218
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:56,681
Three days!?

219
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,891
You get that stuff out of the way so you can
have fun without having to worry about it.

220
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,801
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation.

221
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,061
Why is she
so smart?

222
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:09,171
It seems like the guys up in
heaven that were divvying up...

223
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,931
the stats for us were being
pretty lax about it.

224
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,101
Everyone, tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

225
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,301
Whoever catches
the most bugs...

226
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:21,451
Okay, they'll get to be the
brigade leader for a day!

227
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,611
No thanks!

228
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:26,151
That sounds interesting.
Are any bugs okay?

229
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:30,821
Hmm... only cicadas!

230
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:34,421
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

231
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:38,861
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

232
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,991
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

233
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:44,341
Now!
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

234
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,771
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

235
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,701
but of course, or something to that effect,
the winner ended up being Haruhi.

236
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:53,341
A catch and release attitude
is important, right?

237
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:57,211
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

238
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,811
What could a cicada do,
even if it did come back?

239
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:08,721
For some reason, I kind of feel like
Pandora opening her box.

240
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:13,691
W-Welcome!

241
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,701
The next day, we met up, even though
we had no idea what was going on.

242
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:21,301
And we remained in the dark even as
we were made to wear frog costumes,

243
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:25,211
and then pass out balloons in front
of a supermarket as our part-time job.

244
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,711
It feels like I was just released
from the Adzam's Leader Beam.

245
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,391
Good work, everyone.

246
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,821
What's with this difference
in how we're being treated?

247
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,321
Thanks for the hard work.
The manager is thankful.

248
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,031
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

249
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,131
This is it.

250
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:54,001
I've wanted this
for a while.

251
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,131
The owner said that he'd give it to us
for Mikuru's sake.

252
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:01,011
We worked, sweat pouring down
our foreheads, for that?

253
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,681
Let's hang this up in the
clubroom as a memento.

254
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:08,811
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

255
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:20,891
That night, a single phone call
stole me away from my slumber.

256
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,701
Kyon...

257
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,861
Miss Asahina?

258
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:28,941
Yes, it's me...

259
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,411
At this rate, I...

260
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,471
- Umm...
- Hello, this is Koizumi.

261
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,021
Why are you with
Miss Asahina?

262
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,521
Certain circumstances
came up.

263
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,381
Would it be possible for you
to come join us right now?

264
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:48,191
What in the world happened,
Miss Asahina?

265
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:57,941
Kyon, I... can't go back
to the future...

266
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,031
In other words,
this is what's going on.

267
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,771
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

268
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:12,781
Even if you say something as impossible
as that with a smile on your face...

269
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:16,651
Koizumi, do you realize
what you're saying?

270
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:20,761
I do. Much more than
I wish I did.

271
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,491
I had just been speaking
with Miss Asahina.

272
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,891
Call me too, when you
have talks with her.

273
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,001
And as a result, what we realized
was that recently,

274
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:31,471
the flow of time
was a bit strange.

275
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,601
You might want to credit this
to Miss Asahina.

276
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:37,211
Thanks to her, I was able
to confirm it.

277
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,741
Confirm what?

278
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:43,981
That we have experienced the same
span of time numerous times.

279
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,851
You said that earlier.

280
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:50,621
To be precise, we've been repeating
the time from August 17th to the 31st.

281
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:54,631
We're in the middle of an
endless summer vacation.

282
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,621
Well, it is
summer vacation, but...

283
00:14:57,971 --> 00:15:00,931
It's a never-ending
endless summer.

284
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:07,631
This world has lost all time
after September 1st.

285
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,941
That is why Miss Asahina cannot
go back to the future.

286
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,981
I suppose you could say
that it's natural.

287
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:18,781
What's natural about there being
no future? Who'd believe it?

288
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,711
We'd like for you
to believe it.

289
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:29,651
Umm... I'll explain, too.

290
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,261
Well... because of
"classified information",

291
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:37,741
I'm always contacting the future
and "classified information"-ing.

292
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,441
But I hadn't received any
"classified information"

293
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,641
for about a week or so,
and I thought, "that's strange."

294
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,211
And so I
"classified information"

295
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,721
I was so surprised, I tried
to "classified information",

296
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,891
but it was completely
"classified information".

297
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:03,461
Oh, what do I do?

298
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,771
I don't know what you
should do, either, but I wonder,

299
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:11,931
are your "classified information"s
things that cannot be said on television?

300
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:17,511
Are we trapped inside one of
those closed spaces?

301
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,211
That's not it.

302
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:23,341
A single portion of time
has been torn away.

303
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:28,081
At exactly the point when it becomes
midnight on August 31st,

304
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:33,591
everything resets, and we go back
to August 17th. That's the process.

305
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:40,131
So what about our...
no, humanity's memories?

306
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:45,071
Those are reset as well. Everything
starts over from the beginning.

307
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:48,071
So you mean that time does that
thing that you mentioned.

308
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:51,701
Well, we do have someone from the future
here, I guess it can't be helped.

309
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:54,971
Oh no, Miss Asahina
isn't involved in this.

310
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,211
Okay then,
what's the culprit?

311
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,721
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

312
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,861
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but somewhere inside of her

313
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,031
is a desire to not let
summer vacation end.

314
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,491
What the heck? Do you mean she
feels regret over something?

315
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,401
That's what I believe. Perhaps she feels
that there's something left...

316
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:17,261
that she wants to do during
our summer vacation?

317
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,911
Man, the hopeless situations she causes
unfold on a galactic scale.

318
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,071
So, what are you saying
I should do?

319
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,451
If we knew that, we would
have this problem solved.

320
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,611
I've been wondering this since I got here,
but you seem awfully cheerful about this.

321
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,621
It's because we've finally
been able to solve the mystery

322
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,591
of the frequent feelings of
deja vu that I've had recently,

323
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:41,591
and that you may
have had, too.

324
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:45,361
Now that I think about it, those inexplicable
feelings may have been

325
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,631
remnants from when our
memories have been reset.

326
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,631
Is it possible that other people
across the world feel this, too?

327
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:57,571
It doesn't seem that way.
You and I are a special case.

328
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,411
It appears that the people who
are closest to Miss Suzumiya

329
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,671
are able to sense
this strangeness.

330
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:06,621
What about Haruhi? Does she
sense any of this at all?

331
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:11,711
Not at all, it seems. It would probably
be bad for us if she did.

332
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:18,001
However, I believe that there is one
person who remembers everything,

333
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,501
more than the deja vu
that we do.

334
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,861
And who would
that be?

335
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:26,371
I think you know,
even without my saying.

336
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,341
It's Miss Nagato.

337
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:34,011
I believe that the Thought Entity, which
transcends time and space, would.

338
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,751
Is that right?

339
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,411
It is.

340
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,451
You remember
all of it?

341
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:40,551
Right.

342
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,021
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

343
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:48,891
This is the 15,524th time.

344
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,361
15,524?

345
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:58,171
What do you mean by 15,524?
Nagato, what are you saying?

346
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,431
Are you serious?

347
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,771
I am.

348
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:07,811
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

349
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,251
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

350
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:15,791
Out of 15,524 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

351
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:21,261
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

352
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,991
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

353
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:27,661
but did not go to a goldfish scooping
stand, occurred 437 times.

354
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,861
- We had a part-time job...
- I got it, that's enough.

355
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:40,371
15,524 times,
that's what Nagato said.

356
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:46,011
Times two weeks, hmm,
that's around 595 years.

357
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,781
She alone has memories
of all that time,

358
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,481
repeating it all
over and over.

359
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:58,791
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that
same period of time over and over again?

360
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,631
I've heard yet another
crazy story.

361
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:08,011
The next day,
we went stargazing.

362
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,971
The location was Nagato's
apartment,

363
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,081
and the telescope was one
that Koizumi had gotten for us.

364
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:17,981
Oh, I'm bored of this.
UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.

365
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,301
Exactly what does
she want to do?

366
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,591
Now what could
that be?

367
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,961
How about trying
this out?

368
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,471
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden
embrace from behind,

369
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:43,631
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

370
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:46,511
And who would
be doing that?

371
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:49,241
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

372
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,541
I've been waiting
to hear that!

373
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,881
Like hell I will.

374
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,351
All right, how about
if I do it?

375
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:00,231
I'm kidding.

376
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:04,791
High speed

377
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,401
Home run

378
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,101
Next, we went off
to a batting center.

379
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:17,411
Hey, Nagato, you were aware of this loop
before Miss Asahina said anything, right?

380
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,341
Yes.

381
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,211
If that's the case, why didn't
you say anything?

382
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:24,011
It's my job
to observe.

383
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,481
All right!

384
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:35,491
I win again!

385
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,771
Yay!

386
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,061
Get us more time!

387
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,741
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

388
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:55,281
Hmm. I wonder if this
was good enough.

389
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,341
But... I guess this works.

390
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:02,251
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

391
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:09,721
That's fine, then.

392
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,231
We were able to do a lot this summer,
so that's enough, right?

393
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:17,731
No, it's not.
You're still not satisfied.

394
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,931
Okay, we're done
for today.

395
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:24,171
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

396
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:26,611
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

397
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,511
W-Wait, Haruhi...

398
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:36,621
There it is again!
That deja vu!

399
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,851
And it's a strong one,
stronger than ever before.

400
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:43,391
I can't let Haruhi leave.
If she goes,

401
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,801
we'll end up repeating these past two
weeks for the some-thousandth time again.

402
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:52,671
But what should I do?
What should I say?

403
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,211
What has she said
up to this point?

404
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:59,571
I don't know...
I can't remember...

405
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:14,521
August 31st. I haven't
touched my homework.

406
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:18,091
Whatever, it doesn't
matter anymore.

407
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:23,361
If we're just going to do it all over again,
then there's no point to doing it.

408
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:31,171
Whether tomorrow comes or not, I'll leave
it to the me at that time to deal with it.

409
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,991
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

410
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,721
subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

411
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:53,701
hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

412
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,591
yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

413
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,201
kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

414
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:03,501
tashika ni oboeteru tte

Can I say that
I remember you clearly?

415
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,011
Tomare!
Stop!

416
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,811
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs
to me

417
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,321
touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

418
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,681
nazenara
That's because

419
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:19,891
basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

420
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,721
deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see
the first dream

421
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:25,161
hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had when
we were born

422
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:30,131
doushiyouka tte

Worrying about
"what do I do?"

423
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:33,971
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo

Is laughable when I
think about it now

424
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,301

I've already forgotten it

425
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,271

Let's search
