1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,519
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!
Unforgivable!

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:06,154
What's unforgivable?

3
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:09,490
Taking advantage of what everyone
longs for, a white wedding dress,

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,227
and tainting the eternal dream
of innocent girls

5
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:14,127
is absolutely unforgivable!

6
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:19,231
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,074
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

00:00:55,074 --> 00:01:01,343
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen

00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,588
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight

00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:14,754
Datte junjou dou shiyou

Seiza no matataki kazoe

00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta

15
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:49,152
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

16
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,479
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

17
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,223
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

18
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,392
and fight against bad guys.

19
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,556
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

20
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:12,362
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

21
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,806
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

22
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,536
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

23
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,000
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

24
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:32,045
Dream of a White Dress!

00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,599
Darts

27
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,102
Darts
This is how you make darts.

28
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:45,431
This is how you make darts.

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,735
Another chocolate parfait, please.

30
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:00,710
I wonder what's the matter
with Ms. Akiyama?

31
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:06,523
I can't stand it. It's because of that
home economics class.

32
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,391
I'm so sleepy.

33
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:13,090
Ms. Akiyama used to be so
enthusiastic about sewing.

34
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,354
It is because...

35
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,600
Why are you always showing up from
the least expected places?!

36
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,772
The reason Ms. Higure Akiyama
is acting weird...

37
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:26,576
...has a great deal to do with
her engagement.

38
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:27,873
Engagement?!

39
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:33,014
Yes! Higure Akiyama, 34 years old
and still single.

40
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:36,553
Ms. Akiyama has wished with
all her heart to get married

41
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:40,157
and her greatest dream of her life
is to have a luxurious wedding

42
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:43,092
in a wedding dress that
she made herself.

43
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,964
Higure, I'm a dull business man

44
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,534
with no status or savings,

45
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,331
and I'm not tall at all either.

46
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,497
I cannot give you a very big
wedding reception,

47
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,566
but will you... but will you marry me?

48
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,774
Yes.

49
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:14,658
He may not be what you'd call ideal,

50
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:16,023
but as long as there's love...

51
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,860
That's being soft!
Always have high, limitless ideals!

52
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,501
If there's a handsome guy,
I'll go after him and catch him!

53
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,438
My goal is to get married
before I turn 25!

54
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,407
Miss Usagi, you don't mean that!

55
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,345
Ms. Akiyama!

56
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,085
Ms. Sakurada...

57
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,054
What are you doing?

58
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:47,657
Oh, were you thinking
about your fiance?

59
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,125
Oh, no...

60
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,525
Wow! This silk is beautiful!

61
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,197
Didn't you say you were going to

62
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:57,132
sew your own wedding dress
for the ceremony?

63
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,892
Yes, but I haven't been able to
find a silk cloth that I like,

64
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,940
even though I already have
the design for it.

65
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,709
Hang in there!

66
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,044
You absolutely must complete
a fabulous wedding gown

67
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,875
and have a wonderful ceremony!

68
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:12,916
After all, I'm counting on meeting
my future husband

69
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,611
at your wedding reception!

70
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,646
Okay, I'll do my best.

71
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,188
I better work hard, too!

72
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:33,965
The stars know everything.

73
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:35,900
The star Vega...

74
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,942
The tears of Lyra's Vega
fill the heavens,

75
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,274
but they cannot cross
the vast Milky Way.

76
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,807
The woman about to shine her
brightest under the light of Vega

77
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,540
is Higure Akiyama.

78
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,954
I know who my next target is!

79
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:51,721
Juban Hall

80
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,423
Juban Hall
Wow! Congratulations!
She is so beautiful!

81
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,390
Wow! Congratulations!
She is so beautiful!

82
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:58,128
It's so wonderful! Please be happy!

83
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,288
Wow...

84
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,020
A bride! She looks great!

85
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:06,469
That's got to be the dream of every
girl in love. One day, I'll also...

86
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,338
No, no. Bring it more this way!

87
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,670

And my groom will be...

94
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,468
Tuxedo Mask!

95
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,958
Motoki!

96
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:44,537
I'm so happy! This is bliss!

97
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,770
Oh, but I'm not good at sewing.

98
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:52,782
I could never make a dress!

99
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:54,184
Hey, hey!

100
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,119
It's says a free wedding reception,

101
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,987
but what if the woman doesn't have
a fiance... No, I mean...

102
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,557
What if there's no set date?!

103
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:03,159
The ceremony can be held whenever
the grand prize winner wishes,

104
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,395
no matter how many years
in the future that may be.

105
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,663
Wow!

106
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:11,368
All right! Then I better hurry and find...

107
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,202
Rei.

108
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:12,602
Oh, Usagi!
Rei.

109
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:13,570
Oh, Usagi!

110
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,038
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,706
Oh, nothing really!

112
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:17,841
What about you?

113
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,311
By the way, your mother is a
full-time housewife, right?

114
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,404
Huh? So, what about it?

115
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,410
Usagi.

116
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,218

Rei, what's going on?!

118
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:31,320
Rei, what's going on?!

119
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,247
A handmade wedding dress contest...

120
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,323
So, your name is Rei?

121
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,230
Yes!

122
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,424
Oh, dear...

123
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:45,802
I didn't know Usagi had
a nice friend like you!

124
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,805
Oh, yes! We go to different schools,

125
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,673
but we are very good friends!

126
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:53,506
How can she say that?
She just followed me home.

127
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,179
That's my cake!

128
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,815
Usagi! She's just
unbelievable sometimes.

129
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,016
Go ahead, please help yourself.

130
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:00,517
Wow! Thank you!
Go ahead, please help yourself.

131
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:01,745
Wow! Thank you!

132
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,483
What's going on, Usagi?

133
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:07,223
I don't know!

134
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:10,994
Your homemade cake is delicious!

135
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:13,496
You must be a wonderful cook!

136
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,998
Oh, my!

137
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:17,434
You goody two shoes! One look,
and you can tell it's from

138
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,169
the cake store in front of
the train station! Ouch!

139
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,966
That hurt!

140
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,373
Usagi is one lucky girl!

141
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,442
You are such a wonderful mother,

142
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:28,044
you must also be good
at sewing, right?

143
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,245
What?!

144
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,981
It has always been my dream
to learn sewing

145
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,006
from somebody wonderful like you!

146
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,810
For example, sewing a wedding dress.

147
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:40,314
Sewing, you say?

148
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,029
Thank you for having me!

149
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,500
If she's not good at sewing, why didn't
you just tell me so earlier?!

150
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,136
Hey! So, you were planning on
making my mom help you

151
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,071
and participate in that wedding dress
contest, weren't you?!

152
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,677
Why you little, dirty, lying,
sneaky, tramp!

153
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:03,780
You're unbelievable! If you have
time for a contest like that,

154
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,215
I wish you'd train yourself more

155
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:07,250
in preparation for the
monsters' next move!

156
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,418
You too, Usagi!

157
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,818
Huh? What? Hey, Usagi!

158
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:13,189
A wedding dress contest?

159
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,693
That's right. And Rei's talking
about participating too!

160
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:18,595
Ami, doesn't that get
on your nerves?!

161
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:21,962
Not really. I don't have any plans
to get married anyway.

162
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:28,404
Don't you get it? It's a dream!
A dream! Every girl's dream!

163
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:31,040
Hey, Ami, I know you get good
grades in home economics.

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,742
Teach me how to sew?

165
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35,210
Well, if you really want me to.

166
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:39,613
Yay! I'm not gonna lose to that Rei!

167
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,610
What?!

168
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,021
If you want to learn the basics,
these should get you started.

169
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,682
The actual sewing lessons
will come after that.

170
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,158
Ami, you're something else...

171
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,757
It's mine! No, it's mine! Don't!
I'm first! No, you're not!

172
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,832
I'm the one who'll win the contest!
No, I am!

173
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,167
I got this first!

174
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,269
No, I was first!

175
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,769
Ms. Haruna...
No, I was first!

176
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,736
Ms. Haruna...

177
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,240
Oh, this silk is...

178
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,468
Beautiful.

179
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,711
It is very beautiful.

180
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,044
Excuse me?

181
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,775
This is a wonderful silk.

182
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,717
A silk worthy of becoming
your wedding dress.

183
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:25,486
Oh, I can just see you standing under
a sky full of stars

184
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,864
and walking along a shoreline.

185
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:32,096
Every star is sure to sparkle and
bestow their blessing upon you.

186
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,704
Here.

187
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,999
I wish you happiness.

188
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:13,110
A grand wedding reception for free?!

189
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,778
I didn't know that.

190
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:17,948
See? Naru, that's why I have
to enter the contest!

191
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:20,317
Don't you think so?

192
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,052
I get it now.

193
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:25,055
You nod off all the time during
home economics,

194
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,425
but you even visited Ms. Akiyama at
her home to ask her about sewing.

195
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,294
I knew something fishy was going on.

196
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,592
Because I just don't know what to do.

197
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,026
But making a dress isn't
that easy, you know.

198
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,167
Not to mention your
short attention span.

199
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:42,072
I'll be fine!

200
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:44,608
After all, they say, "A woman's
conviction can crack a rock."

201
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:45,676
What does that mean?

202
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:46,276
Oh? Did I get that saying wrong?
What does that mean?

203
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:47,378
Oh? Did I get that saying wrong?

204
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:49,073
What the heck is she up to?

205
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:52,616
Juban Heights
Hey, who is the guy?

206
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:53,851
Juban Heights
He and the bouquet
don't go well together.

207
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:54,518
He and the bouquet
don't go well together.

208
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,315
He looks like a loser.

209
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,487
You shouldn't say things like that.

210
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,393
He's visiting Ms. Akiyama's apartment!

211
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:03,694
Don't tell me that's...

212
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:06,026
Ms. Akiyama's fiance?!

213
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:08,829
Miss Higure?

214
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:13,667
What's wrong?
You won't even answer my calls.

215
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,470
Are you feeling okay?

216
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,137
Miss Higure?

217
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:22,578
What? Miss Higure?

218
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,853
Well, I...

219
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,514
What is this?!

220
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:34,692
Listen carefully!

221
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,651
Don't come near my place until the
dress contest at Juban Hall is over!

222
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,989
If you do, I'll break off our
engagement! Got that?

223
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:49,665
The dress... The dress... I have to
hurry up and make my wedding dress!

224
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:53,577
Miss Higure...

225
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:56,637
No way! That was our Ms. Akiyama?!

226
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,776
By the contest, did she mean...

227
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:03,020
She can't be! It'll be a really tough
competition if she participates, too!

228
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,121
This can't be happening!

229
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,988
I'm in trouble!

230
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:06,123
You know...

231
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,683
I sense something's wrong
with that teacher.

232
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,476
What?! Our home economics
teacher, Ms. Akiyama?

233
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:30,345
Yes, I definitely feel the aura of
a monster, but it's not clear.

234
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,317
Come to think of it, Ms. Akiyama
has been gone for a while.

235
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,853
See? So, we need to get the help of
Rei's powers, and everyone...

236
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,014
Hey! Stop!

237
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:43,727
What are you going to do with the
only rental wedding kimono we have?!

238
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,024
Hey!

239
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,488
Ouch!

240
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:54,328
Honestly! I thought you were going to
elope with some guy!

241
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:56,405
I hope you're not...

242
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,409
Oh, you still don't trust me!

243
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,812
There is no way that I will participate

244
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,113
in that Juban Hall contest!

245
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:04,281
Of course, not!

246
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,284
It's unforgivable to use a sacred
wedding dress for their promotion.

247
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,485
Shame on them!

248
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,578
Why is he so mad?

249
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:12,689
Excuse me dear,

250
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:15,392
how about having your wedding
ceremony at our shrine?

251
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:19,263
It's much cheaper than having it
at Juban Hall.

252
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:21,198
No, thank you. I don't have anybody
right now anyway.

253
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,258
Ooh! I'm single! If you'll take me...

254
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,237
Here I am.
The beautiful thief, Usagi Hood.

255
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,486
It's perfect!

256
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,120
Usagi!
It's perfect!

257
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,848
Usagi!

258
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,592
I hope you're not planning on using

259
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:52,050
my favorite curtains to make a dress!

260
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,666
Please have mercy, Governor Tsukino!

261
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,760
I'd love to buy the cloth for a dress,
but my allowance...

262
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:00,537
Mom!

263
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,705
Here is my proposition.

264
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:02,306
Huh?
Here is my proposition.

265
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:02,940
Huh?
To pay for the price of new curtains,

266
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,208
To pay for the price of new curtains,

267
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,177
I will suspend your allowance for
the next three months.

268
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:09,079
Governor Tsukino!

269
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,915
Besides, there aren't that many
days left until the contest.

270
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:14,076
Can you get a dress done by then?!

271
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,476
But the grand wedding reception...

272
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:21,023
I just can't give it up!

273
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,248
Juban Hall
Ladies, thank you for participating
in this contest!

274
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:48,518
Thank you, thank you so much!

275
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:50,254
It's a huge success! Huge!

276
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:50,515
It's a huge success! Huge!

277
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:51,755
I wish I could...

278
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:52,990
Don't cry, Usagi.
You did your best.
I wish I could...

279
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,925
Don't cry, Usagi.
You did your best.

280
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,426
Well, I'll acknowledge the effort

281
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,486
you put into stabbing your fingers with
a needle over and over again!

282
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,099
Rei!

283
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,702
Anyway, we need to watch and see if
anything suspicious happens.

284
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:09,570
Usagi, you're going to infiltrate
the hall as a contestant.

285
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:13,543
You meanie! You know
I don't have a dress!

286
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:15,245
You have the transforming pen,
don't you?

287
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:17,076
Oh! I'd forgotten about that.

288
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:24,480
Moon Power!
Turn me into a beautiful bride!

289
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,690
I did it!

290
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,758
How do I look?

291
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,328
I could win for sure with this!

292
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,737
Don't you wish you were me?

293
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:41,371
Usagi!
Don't you wish you were me?

294
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:41,939
Usagi!

295
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,174
You wouldn't win fairly.

296
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,143
You're only participating, okay?!

297
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:47,508
I knew it.

298
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:55,218
Ladies and gentlemen!

'92 Your Handmade

We will now start the handmade
wedding dress contest!

302
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:05,762
Where is that teacher?!

303
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,559
I can't find her!

304
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,969
Please be quiet! And now...

305
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:24,403
Ms. Akiyama! Wow!

306
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:28,652
Excuse me, we cannot have
you doing unplanned...

307
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,176
Shut up!

308
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:37,227
Oh, you're my ideal bride!
Please marry me!

309
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:40,754
Shut up! You actually think you're
good enough for me?!

310
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,591
All the men in the world should
fall to their knees before me!

311
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,305
And all the women should
surrender to my beauty!

312
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,373
I am the winner in this contest!
I and no other!

313
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,948
Don't, Usagi!
Don't look at her eyes!

314
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:11,495
Oh, I don't believe you, Luna!
You saw, didn't you? You pervert!

315
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,292
This isn't the time for that.

316
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,665
The energy level has peaked.

317
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,634
Come out, monster, Widow!

318
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:33,908
Ms. Akiyama! So, you finally
showed up, you monster!

319
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,754
It's just as creepy as the other ones!

320
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,423
Who are you?!

321
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:40,991
Wait!

322
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,059
The Happy Couple

323
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,924
The Happy Couple
Hey!

324
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,896
The wedding dress is the eternal
dream of innocent girls!

325
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:52,102
No one will get away with tainting
that pure white dress!

326
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:55,765
That's not fair!
You two get all the cool parts!

327
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,574
Okay, then!

328
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:02,841
Since I lost the chance to win a free
grand wedding reception...

332
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:55,224
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

333
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:58,323
Likewise, I'm Sailor Mercury!

334
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:02,370
Likewise, I'm Sailor Mars!

335
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,107
In the name of the moon,

336
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,079
we will punish you!

337
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,706
Impertinent girls!

338
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:15,452
No!

339
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:16,419
Idiot!

340
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:20,524
I will weave a beautiful shroud for you!

341
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:22,192
But, of course, I have to
weave you in it!

342
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:24,558
No, no, no!

343
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,887
Bubble

344
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,059
Spray!

345
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,307
What is this?!

346
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:38,968
Fire

347
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:44,571
Soul!

348
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,508
Are you all right?

349
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,488
You're being such a baby!

350
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:54,057
But I hate spiders!

351
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,525
You! Where are you?!

352
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,325
Moon Tiara Action!

353
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,715
Oh...

354
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:21,377
Where am I? What was I doing?

355
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,889
Congratulations! You did it!
Please be happy!

356
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,380
She is so beautiful!

357
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,627
I can't believe he was
still waiting for her

358
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,596
after all the things she said to him.

359
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,665
Well, I guess you can't judge
a man by his looks.

360
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:39,135
But I still prefer a good looking guy!

361
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,762
Hey, Usagi!

362
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:44,641
Did you know that the person
who catches

363
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:47,010
the bride's bouquet will get
to marry next?

364
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,877
What?!

365
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:49,003
Really?!

366
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:54,217
It's mine!

367
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:56,019
No, it's mine!

368
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,680
No, I'll be the first!

369
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:13,504
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

370
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:20,171
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

371
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:35,389
Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

372
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:42,527
Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

373
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:51,305
Anata dake ki ni naru
shunkan ga atta no

374
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:58,272
Motto kirei ni ima sugu naritai

375
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:05,811
Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne

376
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,390
Me o tojite tashikamete

377
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:26,276
Dakishimeta tokimeki sono
mama kono omoi tsutaetai
