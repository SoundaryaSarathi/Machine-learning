1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,230
Welcome to the world of OZ.

2
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,730
OZ is a virtual world that can be enjoyed

3
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,330
by people from all over the world.

4
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,180
You can easily access OZ through a personal computer,
cellular phone, or even your television.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,430
Now, let's try experiencing the world of OZ.

6
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,900
First, let's customize your avatar.

7
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,480
Your avatar is your virtual self inside OZ.

8
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,380
You can choose your avatar's clothing,
hairstyle, and even give it a tail.

9
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,380
I see you've created an adorable avatar.

10
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,980
All your personal information will be safely managed

11
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,680
by our world-class security system,

12
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,780
so you can relax and enjoy.

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,030
Inside the shopping mall you can find music, movies, furniture,

14
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,090
food, cars, real estate, souvenirs and more

15
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,480
from all over the globe, just like in the real world.

16
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,390
If you wish to shop around more, try the Galleria.

17
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,760
World-famous brand name stores can be found here,

18
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,090
and you can even buy items to decorate your avatar.

19
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,730
But what's most necessary in OZ is nothing other than...

20
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,730
Communication.

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,950
OZ supports instantaneous translation services
for every language in the world,

22
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,100
so you can enjoy conversation with anybody,
no matter where they might hail from.

23
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,880
There are currently 4 million active communities in OZ.

24
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,330
Through your avatar,

25
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,590
you can also try your hand at various sports.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,180
OZ supports a lively business environment as well,

27
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,000
and companies worldwide have set up branches inside OZ.

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,990
You can open an office here, too.

29
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,470
Furthermore, many administrative bodies and local governments

30
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,680
can be dealt with through OZ.

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,580
You can pay your taxes and take care of various legal processes.

32
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,480
Finally, let us introduce the guardian spirits of OZ,

33
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,230
John and Yoko.

34
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,980
Welcome and thank you for subscribing.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,580
Now, it's time for you to start an engaging life inside OZ.

36
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,640
Monday, July 26th,

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Afternoon News.

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,030
This morning, the planetary probe "Arawashi"

39
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,780
moved from its orbit around the Sun to circle the Earth.

40
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,830
Through Arawashi experienced many problems during its journey,

41
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,030
the plans to send the solar sample capsule

42
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,900
gathered from the planetoid Matokawa to Earth

43
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,280
are proceeding as scheduled.

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,230
And now for our next item.

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,280
If I'd just tried a little harder I could've represented Japan...

46
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,480
That again? Just give it a re...

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,580
Hey, part-timers! Quit slacking!

48
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,830
Yes sir.

49
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,330
But it's really a shame.

50
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
Oh, shove it.

51
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,080
Try and find something else to do.

52
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's think up something to do for summer vacation.

53
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,730
Girls! C'mon, girls!

54
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,430
Watermelon, fireworks, and girls.
That's what comes to mind when you say summer, right?

55
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,030
Watermelon and fireworks are enough for me.

56
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,180
Don't be such a wimp.

57
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,280
I don't care either way.

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
Anybody up for a part-time job?

59
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,080
We're actually in the middle of one...

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,480
A job?

61
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,510
We're running additional system maintenance on OZ.

62
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,330
On OZ? That's amazing!

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,730
No, no. We're just code monkeys. It's nothing special.

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,030
I see, so you were already working... darn.

65
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,760
Isn't there anyone who's free?

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,380
Umm, Natsuki-sempai! If you're okay with me...

67
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Really?

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,880
Hey, what about this?

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,830
Sorry, I don't think I can do it after all.

70
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,080
No good, huh?

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,480
All you'd have to do is follow me into the country...

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Then I'll do it!

73
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,280
What the hell?

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,130
Then... me too!

75
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,430
But two's a bit much.

76
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,930
All I need is one.

77
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,380
I'll take on anyone!

78
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,880
- When are you coming?
- I'm getting on the train right now. Wait for me! Natsuki

79
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,080
Ah, Kenji-kun! Over here!

80
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,430
Nah, you're right on time.

82
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,480
Sakuma-kun would've probably run late.

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,920
I'll do whatever you want.

84
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,180
Thanks.

85
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,680
For now, I just want you to carry my stuff.

86
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,480
We're going to Ueda in Nagano?

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,330
It's my Grandma's birthday party.

88
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,560
Relatives are coming from all over the country,

89
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,580
and we're really strapped for able bodies.

90
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,380
But anyway, what was that about representing Japan?

91
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,380
I heard about it from Sakuma-kun.

92
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,680
He said you almost made it.

93
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,980
What kind of contest was it?

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,860
A math Olympiad.

95
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,680
An Olympiad? What's that?

96
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,670
So you're good at math, huh.

97
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,810
Umm, I guess.

98
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,280
Math is all I'm really good at.

99
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,530
Calculate something.

100
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,950
Okay. Sempai, when were you born?

101
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,230
Me? July 19th, 1992.

102
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,300
It was a Sunday.

103
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,980
July 19th, 1992 was a Sunday.

104
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,830
Did you memorize all that?

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,780
No.

106
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,180
It's something called modular calculation, and... was I right?

107
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,730
Sorry.

108
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,830
I don't know what day it was.

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,280
Ueda, Ueda.

110
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,050
It's Grandma's 90th birthday this year, so...

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,230
I see, she was born in 1920! She's lived very long, hasn't she?

112
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,830
Natsuki-chan?

113
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,070
Natsuki-chan!

114
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,870
Noriko-obasan!

115
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,200
Long time no see!

116
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,530
She's the 16th head of the Jinnouchi clan.

117
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,530
The 16th?

118
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,130
There are even graves from all the way
back to the Muromachi era on our grounds.

119
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,130
The clan struck it big trading in silk

120
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,480
during the Meiji era, but our late grandfather

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,180
practically burned through all that money and...

122
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,560
Yumi-san!

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,540
Natsuki-chan!

124
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,930
The country's changed so much!

125
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,930
Nothing's left from what we used to have.
Not the mountains, not the stores, not the factories.

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,860
But still, you should see the letters that grandmother gets.

127
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,030
Nearly all of them are from company
presidents and famous politicians.

128
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,200
Natsuki-chan!

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,700
Nana-san!

130
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,480
You know, sometimes grandmother gets really scary.

131
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,420
She's the daughter of a warrior clan, see.

132
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,830
You'd better watch out.

133
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,230
What is this place?

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,470
You must all be tired from the journey here, hmm?

135
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,700
Come, there's ice-cold watermelon inside.

136
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,910
I love watermelon!

137
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
Let's go! Hurry!

138
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,100
Uhh, congratulations on your ninetieth birthday.

139
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,750
It's my mother's birthday, actually...

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,810
- Kenji-kun!
- Right!

141
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,180
Sorry to spring this on you suddenly,

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,380
but try to humor Grandma
no matter what she says, okay?

143
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,610
Humor her?

144
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,080
Mother?

145
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,700
Come in.

146
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,870
Grandma!

147
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,980
- So you've come.
- It's been so long!

148
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,620
Are you feeling all right?

149
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,160
As you can see, I'm doing fine.

150
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,230
They said you were feeling weak...

151
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,150
It was just the heat. Don't worry.

152
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm so relieved.

153
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,170
Hello.

154
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,530
Remember our promise, okay?

155
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,830
Who is this young man?

156
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,300
His name is Koiso Kenji.

157
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,580
Pleased to meet you.

158
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,180
I know Natsuki-sempai from our high school physics club...

159
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,730
That is... He's my boyfriend.

160
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,480
Boyfriend?

161
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,780
Right. My husband-to-be.

162
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,500
Husband-to-be!

163
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,830
Right. Husband-to-be.

164
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,230
Really.

165
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,920
Well? I told you I'd bring him, didn't I?

166
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,930
Uh? What's going...

167
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,380
- Kenji-san.
- Yes'm!

168
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,580
This child is yet immature and naive.

169
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,430
Are you confident that you can make her happy?

170
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,730
Ah, umm,

171
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,080
that is...

172
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,180
Well...

173
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,180
I asked whether or not you have what it takes!

174
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,380
Yes...

175
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,380
Truly?

176
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,780
Yes, well...

177
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,330
Would you give your life for her?

178
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,130
...Yes.

179
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,210
That's good to hear.

180
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,980
Oh, right.

181
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,930
What is it?

182
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,370
A present.

183
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,480
A morning glory patterned yukata!

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Thank you!

185
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,180
Kenji-san, pleased to meet you.

186
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,980
No, the pleasure is mine!

187
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,280
Sorry!

188
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,230
I can't do it!

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,880
I'll explain what the job's about again.

190
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,980
I'm telling you I can't do it!

191
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,550
You just have to pretend that you're my boyfriend
in front of Grandma and the rest of my relatives.

192
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,420
No, no, no, no!

193
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,510
I can't do it!

194
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,380
I've never even gone out with a girl before.

195
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,030
I'm begging you!

196
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,880
Grandma was always so healthy,
so when I heard she was sick I panicked and told her,

197
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,030
"I'll bring my boyfriend to see you, so don't die." It was a promise.

198
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,530
Okay? You understand, right?

199
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,280
Ri, right. I understand what you want.

200
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,930
Thanks!

201
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,130
Okay, from now on call me "Natsuki-chan" instead of "sempai."

202
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,080
It's part of your back story.

203
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,630
Back story?

204
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,380
You're attending Tokyo U,
you're from a distinguished clan,

205
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,980
and you just got back from studying abroad in America...
should be about it.

206
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,680
Tokyo U, distinguished clan, studied abroad...

207
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,900
That's everything I'm not!

208
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,630
- Got it?
- No, I can't do it!

209
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,330
No no no no!

210
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,130
And here you said you'd do anything.

211
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,730
C'mon, just for four days.

212
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,780
Then I can just tell them we broke up later.

213
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,480
Please!

214
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,030
You're getting old, aren't you?

215
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,380
Jinnouchi Fishery

216
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,530
Thanks for the ride.

217
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,880
Sis, your helmet!

218
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,480
And out! The game is over!

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,630
Making a remarkable last-minute
comeback thanks to the pitcher Jinnouchi...

220
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,030
Yeaaaah!

221
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,420
- He wooon!
- Yeaaah!

222
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,680
What is it? Did he win?

223
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,180
Ryouhei-niichan's awesome!

224
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,210
I'm telling everyone!

225
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,380
- Me too!
- Me too!

226
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,580
Unexpected indeed!

227
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,380
A miracle has taken place!

228
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,880
What do you mean, "unexpected?" Honestly!

229
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,930
Ryouhei-niichan won!

230
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,050
Oh, that's great!

231
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,980
Be sure to tell Grandma too.

232
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,930
Yeah!

233
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,230
Let's go!

234
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,030
Natsuki!

235
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,390
Where are you, Natsuki?!

236
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,810
What's all the shouting for, Shouta?

237
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,100
A fiance!

238
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,680
Over my dead body!

239
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
Dammit, I should've been on my guard!

240
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,480
- Ryouhei-niichan won!
- He won!

241
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,730
That's great!

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,570
And here's something to celebrate!

243
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,430
- What is it?
- What is it?

244
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,580
Behold!

245
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,380
Squid!

246
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,370
Aha!

247
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,670
More squid!

248
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,670
Voila!

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,170
Uhhh...

250
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,030
Only squid?

251
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,830
Well...

252
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,890
Family Tree

253
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,210
I'll introduce everyone.

254
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,770
First is great aunt Mariko from the main
branch and her children aunt Rika and uncle Riichi,

255
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,020
and then here's great uncle Mansuke
and uncle Tasuke, aunt Naomi.

256
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,600
Aunt Kiyomi and uncle Tasuke's son Shouta.

257
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,620
Over here is great uncle Mansaku who has three sons.

258
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,650
Uncle Yorihiko's wife aunt Noriko,

259
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,610
uncle Kunihiko's wife aunt Nana,

260
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,450
uncle Katsuhiko's wife aunt Yumi,

261
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,280
aunt Yumi's children Yuuhei and Kyouhei,

262
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,370
aunt Nana's daughter Kana,

263
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,870
and aunt Noriko's children Shingo and Mao.

264
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
- Got it?
- Uhh...

265
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,780
Umm, that's...

266
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,230
Well anyway!

267
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,670
Nice to meet you!

268
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
Nice to meet you.

269
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,420
Let's have a drink.

270
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,050
So Grandmother gave you the green light, hmm?

271
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,380
And every guy I ever brought home got turned down just like that.

272
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,010
But come on, he's loaded, goes to Tokyo U, even studied abroad!

273
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,270
Perfect, isn't he?

274
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Really. Almost too good to be true.

275
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,830
You two spinsters should be taking notes!

276
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,990
Shut up!

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,730
- What's wrong with being divorced?
- I'm happy being single!

278
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,830
So, young man. How're the plans coming along for children?

279
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,620
What?

280
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,980
You know, children.

281
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,500
What're you bringing that up for, you perverted old man?

282
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,880
He only came to say introduce himself.

283
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,710
Eh? But doesn't that mean

284
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,170
that he's done it with Natsuki-chan?

285
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,380
Am I wrong?

286
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,460
Come, you're a college student, aren't you?
How far have you two gotten?

287
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,390
Shush!

288
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,260
Nothing wrong with a bit of friendly
teasing for soon-to-be family, eh?

289
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,560
What do you mean, soon-to-be family,
grandpa? I won't allow it!

290
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,770
Shouta, that's enough.

291
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,030
You shut the hell up!

292
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,600
Is that any way to speak to your own father?

293
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,400
I'll have you know I watched over
Natsuki since she was just a little kid.

294
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,980
That was years and years ago.

295
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,680
He's got to get permission from me.
I'm her second cousin, you know.

296
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,740
And since when did second cousins
have any say in things like that?

297
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,450
But still!

298
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,410
It's fine, as long as mother's given her blessing.

299
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,910
That's everything in our household.

300
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,320
Grandma, are you really sure about this?

301
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,500
Of course.

302
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,880
Kenji-san is excellent groom material.

303
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,320
My eyes are sharp as ever.

304
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,380
A Jinnouchi man has to be solid and trustworthy!

305
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,210
How could he guard his family and his lands if he were not?

306
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,260
Hear, hear!

307
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,090
The men of Jinnouchi must be strong!

308
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,400
After all, we of the Jinnouchi were once
soldiers of the awe-inspiring Takeda army!

309
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,190
Here he goes again.

310
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,880
After Takeda's army was defeated
his retainers scattered to the four winds,

311
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,830
and our once glorious past was in shambles.

312
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,380
But our ancestors fought bravely in many wars

313
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,380
to hold the land they'd found in Ueda.

314
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,280
August 2nd, 1585!

315
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,830
Just 2000 of our ancestors

316
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,340
clashed against 7000 of Tokugawa's elite!

317
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,130
That was the first battle of Ueda!

318
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,580
Right in one!

319
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,480
It was a crafty, wily war!

320
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,730
The enemy thrust forth into the center of the village,

321
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,130
and there our ancestors took advantage of the terrain,

322
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,960
driving the enemy to the river's banks...

323
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Turn around.

324
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,450
Why did I have to lose that game of rock-paper-scissors?

325
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,980
I have to admit I'm jealous.
Pretending to be her boyfriend, huh?

326
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,130
There's nothing to be jealous of. It's just a job.

327
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,180
So come on, how is it? Fun?

328
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,660
I'm surrounded by strangers. It's hard.

329
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, sure. As if.

330
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,580
You're sleeping under the same roof as
Natsuki-sempai, the prettiest girl in school!

331
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,380
Since you're pretending to be her boyfriend anyway,
you might as well ask to share the same room.

332
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,980
Wh-what?!

333
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
There's no way that'd fly!

334
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,680
Well, best of luck.

335
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,030
Huh? Where am I?

336
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,110
Now that I look at it, this is one big house.

337
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,980
What do you want?

338
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,000
Uhh, I'm just a little lost.

339
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,040
The bathroom's around the corner to your right.

340
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,000
Thanks.

341
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,280
Shouldn't you be with everyone else?

342
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,270
Mommy!

343
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,190
You haven't toweled off yet.

344
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,350
Kana...

345
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,110
S-s-sorry!

346
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,930
The bathroom's free. You should take a bath.

347
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,720
No, I, that is, I don't need to, not today, umm...

348
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,080
Natsuki-sempai's been in this tub...

349
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,780
- It was a tie! - A tie!

350
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,680
Hayate, it's me.

351
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,980
Have you forgotten me?

352
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,850
Why are you here?

353
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,760
What do you mean by that? This is my home.

354
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,180
Like hell it is!

355
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,980
Fiery as ever, aren't you, Mariko-obasan.

356
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,830
Things haven't changed a bit since ten years ago.

357
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,530
The same goes for you.

358
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,680
Is that any way to act,

359
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,880
showing your face for the first time in a decade?

360
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,080
What's the occasion?

361
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,780
The birthday celebration is on Sunday.

362
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,080
Whose?

363
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,380
Wabisuke.

364
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,630
Wabisuke?

365
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,580
Hey, granny. Still alive?

366
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,130
I should say the same.
I was worried you'd had an accident somewhere.

367
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,230
That attitude would keep you breathing past a hundred.

368
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,130
Have you...

369
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,900
had anything to eat?

370
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,330
I'm not hungry.

371
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,570
Japan's really a bore.

372
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,430
Humid and hot summer,

373
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,830
narrow roads,

374
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,380
and full to bursting with people.

375
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,420
But at least the beer's great.

376
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Ojisan?

377
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,140
Wabisuke-ojisan!

378
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,140
Natsuki?

379
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,640
Is that you, Natsuki?

380
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,780
Awesome! You came back!

381
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,430
Natsuki! Let go of him.

382
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,480
Why? Come on...

383
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,480
It's already been a decade, huh.

384
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,450
Like they say, time flies.

385
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,440
Umm... who is Wabisuke-san, exactly?

386
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,440
You've never met him before, have you, Nana-chan?

387
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,080
It's a complicated story.

388
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,130
It's not complicated at all. He's family.

389
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,180
Long story short he's the son of Grandfather's mistress.

390
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,210
Really?

391
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,840
It was common place back in the old days.

392
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,170
He sold the deed to Grandma's mountains,

393
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,470
took the money and ran all the way to America!

394
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,850
He's a horrible, selfish man.

395
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,130
Really?

396
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,520
You haven't married yet?

397
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,030
Then, do you have a girlfriend?

398
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,630
Why would you want to know?

399
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,830
Great.

400
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,250
I'll come visit you in America soon.

401
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,810
You can take me to the Disney resorts.

402
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,320
First California, then Florida.

403
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,780
And then we'll go back to your place.

404
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,780
Give me your phone number so I can call you.

405
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,080
If you win.

406
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,620
Huh? Come on!

407
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,080
That's more fun, isn't it?

408
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,640
Fine...

409
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,710
Hah!

410
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,710
3 bright! There you go.

411
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
Want to stop?

412
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,460
Not yet.

413
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,730
Koi koi!

414
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,590
I see. Then, my turn.

415
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,720
Going for 4 bright, hmm?

416
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,180
N-not really...

417
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
What a shame!

418
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,520
3 plain.

419
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,400
Ah, koi koi?

420
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,030
Nope.

421
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,310
Come on!

422
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,030
I win.

423
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,220
Now, time for you kids to go to bed.

424
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,830
I don't wanna. One more?

425
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,740
I like to cut and run.

426
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,700
Take it from here.

427
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,370
I haven't figured out the rules yet...

428
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,280
Hey, how long are you going to stay?

429
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,830
Dunno.

430
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,040
Just don't leave at all!

431
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,500
Right? Got it?

432
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,930
What am I doing here?

433
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,730
Text message

434
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,570
What is this?

435
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,030
Got it!

436
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,460
Message sent

437
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,560
What was that?

438
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,300
Let's see how she's doing...

439
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,540
Blood Pressure Heartbeat

440
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,130
- Get up!
- Get up!

441
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,980
Wake up already!

442
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,470
Get uuup!

443
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,220
The damage is quite extensive, yes.

444
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,770
What what what what what?

445
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,830
Look!

446
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,520
That's him, isn't it?

447
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,520
Dead certain. He's the culprit!

448
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,860
The culprit is a minor? A student!?

449
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,080
Now, the more I look at him, the younger he seems to be.

450
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,780
He must be a high schooler, right?

451
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,660
That's...

452
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,910
that's me!

453
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,290
This young man has managed to infiltrate
OZ's system and plunge it into chaos.

454
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,630
Current state of OZ

455
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,040
It'll be quite a while until things are back to normal.

456
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,540
The attack seems to have been carried out on a whim.

457
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,260
A pleasure crime, then.
I did notice that I couldn't read my mail in the morning.

458
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,980
You know, there are almost as many
OZ subscribers as there are cell phone users.

459
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,100
Since every aspect of everyday life,
from shopping to taking care of business

460
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,190
will be affected by this attack, it seems certain that

461
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,940
punishment will be unavoidable even if it was only a pleasure crime.

462
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,780
What's a pleasure crime?

463
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Something that feels good?

464
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,530
What's so funny over there?

465
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,700
Breakfast time!

466
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,490
- Hey! Gimme...
- No!

467
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,250
Hang on! No! Give me that! Give it back!

468
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,830
Criminal, criminal!

469
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,380
Give it to me!

470
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,460
He's evil!

471
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,840
It's not me!

472
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,680
Huh?

473
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,090
Time to eat!

474
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,680
Unable to access the OZ Family network.
You may attempt to log in 2 more times.

475
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,680
Huh?

476
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,230
Unable to access the OZ Family network.
You may attempt to log in 1 more time.

477
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,230
Huuuh?

478
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,100
Why?

479
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,080
Where was it again...

480
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,780
There!

481
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,480
Are you behind this?

482
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,680
Hey, lemme use your PC!

483
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
I don't like the way you asked.

484
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,730
Ask like you'd ask a business partner.

485
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,080
Excuse me, but may I please

486
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,880
use your computer for a moment?

487
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,420
Thanks!

488
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,630
Why?

489
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,950
What's wrong?

490
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,260
I think my account's been hijacked!

491
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,980
So you've been framed, huh.

492
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,060
What do I do?

493
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,810
Call customer support.

494
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,520
That's right!

495
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,520
Hello? He...

496
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,980
Your OZ account has not been authenticated,

497
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,530
so you cannot peruse your cellular phone.

498
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,320
I can't call them! It won't work!

499
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,610
Calm down.

500
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,570
Koiso-kun.

501
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,410
I told you, calm down.

502
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,410
It's a Sakuma-san calling from Tokyo.

503
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,630
Don't tell me you're behind this.

504
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,500
Of course I'm not!

505
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,790
Figured. You don't have the motive or
the guts to pull off something like this.

506
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,920
All right, already! Help me out!

507
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,680
Ain't gonna happen.

508
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,830
The password's been changed.
I can't connect to the control sector.

509
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,800
I thought OZ's security was supposed to be world class!

510
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,100
A strange e-mail was spread all through OZ yesterday.

511
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,060
A strange e-mail?

512
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,530
OZ's security is locked with a 2056 number code.

513
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,810
It can't be hacked so easily.

514
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,020
But it looks like someone managed to crack the code in just one night!

515
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,820
2056 numbers?

516
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,360
What's the first number?

517
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,430
Eight.

518
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,280
That.... that was me.

519
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,490
I solved it.

520
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,330
What?

521
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,230
I just thought it was some kind of math problem and...

522
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,730
So you cracked it? You idiot!

523
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,920
Sorry.

524
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,920
Awesome.

525
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,880
Whatever. I made a guest avatar for you using that phone number.

526
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,260
It's better than nothing, right?

527
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,310
Use that until this stuff's been settled.

528
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,730
This... is me?

529
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,470
This is an announcement from OZ.

530
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,830
Some of our services are currently unavailable.

531
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,980
We repeat.

532
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,230
This is an announcement from OZ.

533
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,230
Some of our services are currently unavailable.

534
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,780
Hello? Excuse me!

535
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Please stop playing around with my avatar.

536
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,380
This person's framing me!

537
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,130
My account's been stolen!

538
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,170
Just who is he, anyway?

539
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,890
What do you find so funny about wreaking havoc like this?

540
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,730
It's not right to do whatever you
want just because it's the Internet!

541
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,730
Battle mode?

542
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,280
But it should only be active in certain areas...

543
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,320
This is bad.

544
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,820
The regulations of every field have been altered.

545
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,950
In a language I can understand, please...

546
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,580
All of OZ has been made into a battleground!

547
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,780
Run away!

548
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Um, let's talk this over.

549
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,320
Let's talk this over!

550
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,880
Defend yourself!

551
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,020
What're you doing? Move it.

552
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,070
That's...

553
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,100
King Kazma!

554
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,010
Awesome.

555
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,810
So you're...

556
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,030
Don't talk to me. I can't concentrate.

557
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,920
You got him!

558
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,380
He's just a scrub.

559
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,080
There he is!

560
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,440
We've found the criminal!

561
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,930
Right! Arrest him!

562
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,710
Arrest him!

563
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,420
Grab him!

564
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,580
Stop it!

565
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,890
Save me!

566
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,450
It...

567
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,430
transformed.

568
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,230
Damn it! Damn it!

569
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,930
This bastard...

570
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,560
Are you playing a game?

571
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,020
Lemme play too.

572
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,270
Outta the way!

573
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,810
That was close.

574
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,100
You almost lost your account, too.

575
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,820
Here we go.

576
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,400
And, go!

577
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,080
You sing too, Wabisuke-ojisan!

578
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,280
I'll pass.

579
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,730
Leave him be.

580
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,830
Ojichan, what're you looking at?

581
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,130
Women with big tits.

582
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,230
What were you doing in America?

583
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,480
I was a ninja.

584
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,080
Really?

585
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,080
I think I've found the real culprit.

586
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,890
Not human?

587
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,180
What do you mean, not human?

588
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,400
It's an A.I.

589
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,480
An artificial intelligence.

590
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,130
It looks like an experimental hacking A.I. under development

591
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,360
in Pittsburg managed to break loose.

592
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,480
Break loose?

593
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,860
It's called "Love Machine."

594
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,780
Love Machine?

595
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,680
I wish I could ask him to stop.

596
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,630
Honestly, I'm going crazy without my cell phone.

597
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,510
If Ryouhei advances to the nationals,

598
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,380
let's all go visit a hot spring! I'll pay for everyone.

599
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,130
Sounds good.

600
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,340
Haven't I seen that face somewhere?

601
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,520
Natsuki!

602
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,980
What's going on here!

603
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,730
Arrest him! Now!

604
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,760
I just ran a search on his personal file
through the district office's OZ, and what's this?

605
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,600
He's not from an old clan at all!

606
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,700
He's just some salaryman's son!

607
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,360
And a high schooler at that! He's younger than you are!

608
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,130
I just got this fax. Look!

609
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,200
Tokyo U? Studied abroad? Ha!

610
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,120
Umm, well...

611
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,080
Now for our next item.

612
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,880
The planetary probe Arawashi's capsule
has failed to detach from the main body.

613
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,980
King Kazma, the weakest ever!!

614
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,300
What is this stuff? It's unbelievable.

615
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,510
Don't let it get to you. It's just a game.

616
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,510
It's not a game.

617
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,390
It's a sport.

618
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,140
Huh?

619
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,220
I like the fighting and winning part,

620
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,980
not the gaming part.

621
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,350
I see.

622
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,810
But he's different.

623
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,880
He likes to play games. I can tell.

624
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,360
Then... what's he after?

625
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,410
There he is!

626
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,950
There he is!

627
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,980
They found out.

628
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,590
Uhh, Sakuchousei High's are no laughing matter,

629
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,960
but I believe that we'll secure the title in the end.

630
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,010
Go, Ueda High!

631
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,810
Why did you lie about this?

632
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,910
Did you think your grandmother would be happy with lies?

633
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,760
I thought that something was fishy when I heard his specs.

634
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,100
Though if you're looking for a Tokyo U graduate
who's from an old clan, and studied abroad,

635
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,780
I can think of someone who fits the bill in our own family.

636
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,620
That's right, Wabisuke.

637
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,910
You're right, but what's that got to do with anything?

638
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,870
Wait.

639
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,490
Do you think Natsuki's first crush was...

640
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,330
Right! She always liked to hang around Wabisuke.

641
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,330
She used to say she loved him even
back when she was in kindergarten.

642
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,230
She even wrote an essay called "Ojjisan and I."

643
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,680
Noooo!

644
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,720
Stop it!

645
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,180
Just forget about it!

646
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,730
So that's how it was, huh.

647
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,380
Either way!

648
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,080
The real issue here is that this guy's a criminal!

649
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,930
He's got a point.

650
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,080
We can't have someone like that staying here.

651
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,330
You're a cop, aren't you?

652
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,150
Not gonna arrest him?

653
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh, yeah.

654
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,530
Cool.

655
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,630
He's really being arrested!

656
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,930
Don't stare!

657
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,700
Time is 12:30pm.

658
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,200
The charges are... uh...

659
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,540
Was that really you on the news?

660
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,290
I don't know the specifics of what went on,

661
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,670
but was that really you?

662
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,130
- I'm innocent.
- There'll be time for making excuses later!

663
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,920
Hey!

664
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,470
I'm sorry it had to end like this,

665
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,590
but I really enjoyed my time here.

666
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,970
Let him speak.

667
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,060
My father was always away on business trips,

668
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,980
and my mother held down a full-time job too,

669
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,180
so I was always alone at home.

670
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,180
Having dinner as a family, playing hanafuda...

671
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,530
this was the first time in my life I've ever felt so warm.

672
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,480
I was happy.

673
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,180
Thank you for your hospitality.

674
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,980
Thank you, everyone.

675
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,230
- You're welcome.
- Bye bye!

676
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,180
Natsuki-sempai.

677
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,430
Natsuki-sempai!

678
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,930
Shut up!

679
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,280
On the mound is Ueda High's Jinnouchi.

680
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,530
No hits and no runs so far! Give them hell!

681
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:19,770
Go, go, go, go!

682
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,080
Jinnouchi winds up and...

683
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,890
Breaking News

684
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,280
Huuuh?

685
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,970
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news.

686
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,810
I don't care about Arawashi!

687
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,180
- Yumi-chan.
- Yes!

688
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,210
We're going to have a lot of guests today.

689
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,230
There's lots to do, so come help.

690
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,320
Okay.

691
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,830
This car isn't a patrol car, is it?

692
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,700
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

693
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,450
- Oi!
- Yes!

694
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,530
Why aren't they moving? It's a green light!

695
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm sorry!

696
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,230
You're not even close to getting here? Why?

697
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,130
The GPS navigator's on the fritz.

698
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,950
We're around Saitama but the screen says we're in Hokkaido.

699
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,860
And the traffic's brutal.

700
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,480
I can't say when we'll get there.

701
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,580
You can't say? The party is only two days away!

702
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,330
It's fine. The hubbie's on his way overnight on the Shinkansen.

703
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,680
Tell Natsuki too, will you?

704
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,880
And it's a hit! The batter's off!

705
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,130
He just barely makes it to 1st base! Safe!

706
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,430
My apologies. I don't think I'll be able to leave Tokyo today.

707
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,280
You too, Kazuo-san? What's the matter?

708
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,440
Someone's messed with the water pressure.

709
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:56,100
The underground gas pipes and power lines are in danger.

710
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,830
Tell Natsuki I'll try and make it over on the Shinkansen tomorrow.

711
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,020
This won't do!

712
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,490
I've already finished the seating arrangements!

713
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,410
The sacrifice bunt is a success! Safe!

714
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,990
Make way for the ambulance, please.

715
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,310
Can't make it? How come?

716
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,730
Emergency alerts from elderly living
alone are going off all over Matsumoto.

717
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,980
Fat chance of that happening, huh.

718
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,970
Huh? Over in Suwa too?

719
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,780
We got a call and we're on the scene right now,

720
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,240
but there's no fire.

721
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,180
This has been going on all day.

722
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,270
But you worked overtime too, didn't you?

723
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,190
We still have to check. You never know.

724
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,080
We can't afford to miss a real emergency.

725
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,980
The ship's docked at the wrong harbor?

726
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,780
Things are chaotic in Nagoya too?

727
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,330
You can't make it?

728
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,080
Kazuma's waiting.

729
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,800
You're going back? To Sendai?

730
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,210
You need to go to the bathroom?

731
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,630
Right, it's never healthy to hold it in.

732
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,280
Don't sweat it.

733
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,980
Fine, I'll tell Mariko-obasan you can't come.

734
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,060
Hey, Kajitoshi-ojisan from Matsuyama says he can't...

735
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,280
Huh?

736
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,200
Why is everyone suddenly saying they can't make it?

737
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,630
What's going on?

738
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,360
And look at the pitcher, Jinnouchi!

739
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,880
With no outs and bases loaded, he's in dire straights!

740
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,010
Dammit! What's up with this! Lunchtime's almost over!

741
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,000
Turn around!

742
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,890
They say traffic's jammed for 60 kilometers.

743
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,880
If Natsuki hadn't asked, you would've been in for it!

744
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,180
What's going on?

745
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,780
- Terrorism?
- Huh?

746
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,380
Welcome home.

747
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,830
What're you doing back here?

748
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,600
I'm sorry, well...

749
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,430
Did you forget something?

750
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,930
No, well...

751
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,980
Use the on board GPS.

752
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,280
Call the fishermen's union too.

753
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,500
Didn't Yorihiko and his brothers say
they were going to try hashigo-nori?

754
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,500
(T/N: Acrobatics performed on a tall bamboo ladder.)

755
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,540
Ain't the time to worry about that.

756
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,730
And I ordered the birthday dumplings
to match the number of guests, too.

757
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,180
It's iffy whether or not they can
even deliver the dumplings.

758
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,080
What?

759
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,830
Nobody seems to care about the party!

760
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,880
I've been making preparations since last month!

761
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,780
Love Machine's behind all of this.

762
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,280
It can steal any account it wants with that password.

763
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,610
Account?

764
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,650
Your identification on OZ.

765
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,780
OZ supports so many real-life services that

766
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,080
an account's authority is effectively the same as its owner.

767
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,380
You can use a water official's account
to change the city's water system,

768
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,580
and a Japanese Railways Group employee's
account to turn a train around.

769
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,530
There're more than a billion subscribers worldwide.

770
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,530
Countless organizations use OZ accounts to work.

771
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,910
Looks like OZ's security system has backfired on them.

772
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,830
Right.

773
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,540
With the US President's account you might even be able to launch a nuke.

774
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,330
What?

775
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,830
This is all because of me.

776
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,130
All me...

777
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,580
I should really arrest you right now!

778
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,330
Due to severe traffic congestion,
even emergency vehicles are unable to move about.

779
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,830
We ask that all commuters please make way for them.

780
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,030
This is almost like an enemy invasion.

781
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,680
What's an enemy?

782
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,740
People's lives may be in danger.

783
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,450
Hello, what's your emergency?

784
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,180
Huh? Grandma!

785
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,480
Why're you calling an emergency number?

786
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,930
Yorihiko! Make sure to visit all the elderly! Got it?

787
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,300
Kunihiko! This is no time to be lazing about! Move it!

788
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,730
Understand, Katsuhiko? This is a battle.

789
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,930
- I'll do what I can.
- What you can? Huh?

790
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,880
Kan-chan? It's me, Sakae.

791
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
It's been a while, hasn't it?

792
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm asking as a fellow retainer of the Takeda clan:

793
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,260
what kind of emergency plan is the MLIT setting up?

794
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,780
What? You're just now planning a meeting to discuss?

795
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,070
Don't give me that bullshit!

796
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,900
Sone-yan? Get some medical people together

797
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,780
and help the emergency workers. Even the retired ones.

798
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,430
It's your fool of a son's chance to finally
be some help to the world with that NPO of his.

799
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,380
Itomi-san, it's important that everyone communicates

800
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,650
with one another like the old days.

801
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,800
That's your specialty, isn't it?

802
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,210
Sen-san, your decisions are going to be crucial here.

803
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,980
I know it's not easy,

804
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,330
but it's not worth people's lives.

805
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,580
Don't call me sensei,

806
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,040
just listen to an old woman's request.

807
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,720
Why're you bringing up those long gone days, kiddo?

808
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,330
It's been half a century since I beat you up.

809
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,440
Thousands, no, tens of thousands of people are in danger.

810
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,100
If you don't step up now, then when will you?

811
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,560
Don't give up.

812
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,120
No matter what, you can't give up.

813
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,280
This is something only you can do.

814
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,380
You can do it.

815
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm telling you, you can.

816
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,880
Right, that's the spirit.

817
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,380
The man she's talking to is the chief of Police.

818
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,310
Incredible.

819
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,830
Everyone's listening to what she has to say.

820
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,930
Am I deaf? Don't get uppity with me.

821
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,880
Check to make sure your dentures aren't falling out first!

822
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,330
I'm not that old yet!

823
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,780
OZ's engineering team is out in full force,

824
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,930
but they still haven't even gotten close to the control sector.

825
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,580
Try and type in something.

826
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,830
An encrypted code should pop up if you enter the wrong password.

827
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,630
This is a code?

828
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,380
You can do it!

829
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,130
You can!

830
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,860
What the hell is he?

831
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,330
Japan's representative in the math Olympiads.

832
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,180
Almost, that is.

833
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,520
I'm done!

834
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,630
We're in!

835
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:42,670
Sad news, Kenji.

836
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,500
Huh?

837
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,390
Looking into the security logs in the database,

838
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,830
55 people worldwide managed to crack the code yesterday,

839
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,180
but your name isn't among them.

840
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,880
What? Why?

841
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,480
You got the last letter wrong! BZZZT!

842
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,280
What? Dammit, you're not the culprit?

843
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,180
But it looks like everyone who sent in a reply had their avatars stolen.

844
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,280
Hey, cheer up.

845
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,300
You got it right this time.

846
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,100
And so, though there was much confusion nationwide,

847
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,060
thankfully there were no casualties.

848
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,500
The trouble was caused by

849
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,830
a system error brought about when two
identical accounts were accidentally generated.

850
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,800
It has been announced, however, that it is

851
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:35,030
technologically impossible to purposely
misuse OZ's system for malicious intent.

852
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,780
Here we are recapping the 10th day of the
Nagano High School Baseball tournament, with Ueda High...

853
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,080
Everyone quiet down a moment!

854
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,880
Though both teams scored many runs in the final innings,

855
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,750
Ueda High defeated Sakuchousei High

856
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,490
and has advanced to the finals, to be held tomorrow.

857
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,980
- Great!
- Hooray!

858
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,330
Beats me how they managed to win letting 30 hits through, though.

859
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,580
It's a miracle!

860
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,300
You can tell when he thinks he's gonna lose.
It's written all over his face.

861
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,820
Like father, like son, eh?

862
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,310
Natsuki, what about your mom and dad?

863
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,230
Dad's pulling an all-nighter with repairs on the water pipes.

864
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,830
Mom's still in Saitama.

865
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,530
She's staying the night at a business hotel.

866
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,530
I see. That's good.

867
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,280
It's all thanks to Grandma giving everyone orders

868
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,280
that this whole thing calmed down quickly.

869
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,320
Right, Grandma?

870
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,660
I never gave anyone orders.

871
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,030
Oh, come on!

872
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,080
Our Grandma's great!

873
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,360
Japan's best!

874
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,580
You rascals.

875
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,230
Kenji-san, I hear you stepped up to the occasion today as well.

876
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,880
No, I... I didn't really...

877
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,380
Natsuki's boyfriend?

878
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,420
He's not her boyfriend!

879
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,670
I hear he fixed the problem with OZ.

880
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,580
I thought he was still a high schooler!

881
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,140
Not bad, boyfriend.

882
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,630
I'm telling you, he ain't her boyfriend!

883
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,010
What do you care about it?

884
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,380
And now for an update on the OZ
incident which took place this morning.

885
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,980
Though the system has been restored,

886
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,780
over 2 million accounts in Japan alone

887
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,530
are still inaccessible.

888
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,110
Though the cause is not yet clear,

889
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,130
the government has advised all OZ users to take care in managing their accounts.

890
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,280
What is it?

891
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,280
It's about OZ...

892
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:15,530
But...

893
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,780
Love Machine hasn't been beaten yet.

894
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,080
That's right.

895
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,170
Love Machine?

896
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,680
What's that? Morning Musume?

897
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,630
An A.I. that steals accounts.

898
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,420
- What?
- Let's see.

899
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,380
It's got a creepy avatar.

900
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,510
Has bad guy written all over him.

901
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,510
So this thing's behind all the stuff that happened today.

902
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,780
But why wasn't this reported in the news?

903
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,130
I think it's just a matter of time, Master.

904
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,980
The Internet's everywhere,

905
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,330
and the people who've noticed what's going on are already talking about it.

906
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,580
If we pool our knowledge and resources, we should be able to stop it.

907
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,130
Sorry, but that's not gonna happen.

908
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,080
How do you know that?

909
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,630
How? Well...

910
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm the one who developed that thing.

911
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,980
You made Love Machine?

912
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,330
Yeah.

913
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,880
It's a hacking A.I. that I designed.

914
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,530
I just did one thing.

915
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,880
I gave a machine the urge to know.

916
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,380
Then the military of some country came to me,

917
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,430
and asked me to sell it to them so they could run some tests.

918
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,530
I didn't think those tests would be OZ.

919
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,100
Doesn't matter, I guess.

920
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,130
The results are outstanding.

921
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,030
That thing's urge to know

922
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,780
will make it keep collecting information and authority from across the world.

923
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,980
As of now, Love Machine holds the same power as an army millions strong.

924
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,380
Got it? That's why you can't win.

925
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,120
Do you know how many people were hurt today?

926
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,780
Do you know how much confusion was caused?

927
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,990
You're saying it's my fault?

928
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,930
Of course not. The A.I. did it.

929
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,720
The world's in chaos because of you!

930
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,580
You guys just don't get it, do you.

931
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,970
- I said that the A.I....
- You really think that makes it okay?

932
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,780
Don't do it.

933
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,580
You're a coward hiding behind that excuse!

934
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,680
Calm down!

935
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,480
I'm telling you!

936
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:46,580
I just developed the damn thing,
I never told the artificial intelligence to do anything!

937
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:46,780
Shut up!

938
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,580
Stop it! What do you think you're doing with Grandma here?

939
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,130
Wabisuke.

940
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,230
- What's the hubbub?
- Ssh!

941
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,450
You understand, right, Grandma?

942
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,080
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you up to now.

943
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,980
I've been working to make it all up to you.

944
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,980
so that I could come back to
this house with my head held high.

945
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,080
Grandma, look at this.

946
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,880
The American military's given me an official contract.

947
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,770
We're going to get more money

948
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,380
than even Father managed to earn.

949
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,780
This is all thanks to you, Grandma.

950
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,180
I was able to develop it with the money you had, see.

951
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,530
Mother!

952
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,380
Run!

953
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,720
Wabisuke!

954
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,210
Pay the price for your crimes!

955
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,480
I shouldn't have come back.

956
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,980
Ojisan!

957
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,700
Natsuki!

958
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,040
Listen up, you all!

959
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,480
We must take care of the problem caused by one of our own!

960
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,830
Sempai.

961
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,910
Natsuki-sempai.

962
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,780
Don't come near me.

963
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,480
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

964
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,850
These legs of mine just won't listen to me anymore.

965
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,600
You shouldn't have exerted yourself so much.

966
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,580
Thank you.

967
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,780
Then, I'll be going now.

968
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,980
Do you want to play a game of hanafuda?

969
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,930
The whole family used to play together,

970
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,280
but these days it's hard to find
someone willing to play against me.

971
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,730
You can go first.

972
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:55,880
Yes, ma'am.

973
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,580
I'm sorry you had to see that embarrassing spectacle.

974
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,880
It's nothing.

975
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,980
Even Natsuki's foolishness.

976
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,680
Koi koi.

977
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,480
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

978
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,180
Now if I win this round...

979
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,130
You have to have something on the line to make it fun.

980
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,480
There, koi koi.

981
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,580
All right then... If I win,

982
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,830
I want you to take care of that girl.

983
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,180
She's still too immature to be a good fiancee,

984
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,180
but if you can look past those faults,

985
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,580
I want to ask you one more time.

986
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,550
Take care of Natsuki.

987
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,880
I...

988
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,180
I don't yet have that kind of faith in myself.

989
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,980
You can do it.

990
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,480
All I can offer is that I'll do my best.

991
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,180
I win!

992
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,150
- Oh no! Get over here!
- I'm coming!

993
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,080
Quickly!

994
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,630
Grandma!

995
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,140
Open your eyes!

996
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,180
Grandma!

997
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,380
Wake up!

998
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,870
Grandma!

999
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,630
Grandma, can you hear us?

1000
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,040
Grandma!

1001
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,930
Please wake up!

1002
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,780
- Switch with me.
- That's enough.

1003
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,530
No, Katsuhiko! Keep going!

1004
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,340
It's no use.

1005
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,530
Keep going!

1006
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,080
Everyone's here, right?

1007
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,040
5:21 am.

1008
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,280
She was taking heart medicine.

1009
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,330
I used this to monitor the state of her body.

1010
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,080
Her heartbeat, blood pressure, perspiration.

1011
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,890
An alarm should have rung if anything went wrong,

1012
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,980
but I stopped receiving data last night.

1013
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,060
The trouble in OZ?

1014
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:50,150
I guess the system manager's ID was one of the stolen accounts.

1015
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,570
That means she'd have lived if not for that!

1016
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,480
No, I think it was just her time to go.

1017
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,480
What? Like hell it was!

1018
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,440
Where's Wabisuke?

1019
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,380
I'll beat the living daylights out of him!

1020
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,780
I think he took Shouta's car and left last night.

1021
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,720
Nobody knows how to contact him,

1022
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,950
because he's been gone for ten years.

1023
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,180
Damn it!

1024
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,580
Excuse me.

1025
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,530
Stop them.

1026
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:24,930
The tears...

1027
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:30,650
Hold me here.

1028
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,530
Make them stop.

1029
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,470
Now for our next item. The number of people unable to access

1030
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,530
their OZ accounts since yesterday's incident

1031
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,450
has reached over 10  million worldwide.

1032
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,860
Has anyone told Ryouhei?

1033
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,580
We decided to wait until after tomorrow's match.

1034
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,030
Yeah.

1035
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,660
Today's going to be a busy day.

1036
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,030
Noriko-chan, Yumi-chan, Nana-chan.

1037
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,880
I'll leave the cooking to you.

1038
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,380
I hope there'll be enough sake.

1039
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,980
Mansaku, I want you to visit the temple,

1040
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,880
and Yorihiko, I want you and your brothers to tell the neighbors and guests,

1041
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,380
and find some people willing to help out.

1042
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,380
Everyone understand?

1043
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,180
Ain't we got more important things to do?

1044
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,030
That's right, mother! The birthday dumplings!

1045
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,280
We've got to change the order to funeral dumplings.

1046
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,230
To hell with the dumplings!

1047
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,430
We've got to strike back!

1048
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,380
We have to bash that machine to bits! Right?

1049
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,270
Honestly, that's enough.

1050
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:16,980
What?

1051
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,780
You're no help at all, little brother.

1052
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,070
What does age have to do with anything?

1053
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,410
We of the Jinnouchi have to raise our battle standards and fight!

1054
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,080
What's gotten into you, dad?

1055
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,620
We have to hold Grandma's funeral first.

1056
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,730
That's not as important!

1057
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,260
Wouldn't she want us to fight and avenge her honor?!

1058
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,880
Umm.

1059
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,170
I agree.

1060
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,220
Up till now, we never realized that what happened in OZ

1061
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,080
could endanger the lives of real people.

1062
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,280
He's dangerous.

1063
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:50,810
Something like what happened here could happen anywhere else.

1064
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:54,570
So we, at least, have to stop him.

1065
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,860
What're you talking about?

1066
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,930
That is, we have to stop any more people from getting...

1067
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,400
Who're you to be sticking your nose into our family matters, huh?

1068
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,200
But...

1069
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,380
How can we worry about other people on a day like this?

1070
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,660
But...

1071
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,130
Well then, everyone!

1072
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,280
I'm ashamed of the lot of you.

1073
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,800
How can you say you're Jinnouchi men?

1074
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,680
I understand how you feel, father,
but it's about time you acted your age.

1075
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,550
I didn't ask for your opinion.

1076
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,970
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken out of turn...

1077
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,770
No, you were right.

1078
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,490
You have to protect others to protect yourself.

1079
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,530
Is that the JSDF motto?

1080
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,560
No... it's a line from "The Seven Samurai."

1081
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,320
Tasuke-ojisan.

1082
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,280
Hmm?

1083
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,920
Do you stock computers at your store?

1084
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,810
Of course.

1085
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,420
Do you have any better than this?

1086
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,430
Of course we do.

1087
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,380
Kazuma-kun.

1088
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,330
We need to fight him.

1089
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:57,580
This is revenge.

1090
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,960
Honestly, that Mansuke.
What in the world was he thinking?

1091
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,730
There aren't any good pictures here.

1092
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,480
Hey, how about this one?

1093
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,800
Ah, this was the one taken for that one award ceremony.

1094
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,880
That'll do the trick.

1095
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,060
April 1600,

1096
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,440
Tokugawa Hidetada's army of 38,000

1097
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,180
struck at Ueda Castle.

1098
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,110
Our forces at the time numbered a paltry 2,000 men.

1099
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,180
Then how did our ancestors face this battle?

1100
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:29,380
After deliberately luring the enemy into the castle,

1101
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,830
they closed and locked the gates, trapping them inside.

1102
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,980
Trapped like rats, Tokugawa's army

1103
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,880
lost its will to fight and was defeated.

1104
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,230
That was the second siege of Ueda.

1105
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,380
Did that help any?

1106
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,130
That's a good idea.

1107
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:45,130
Then with that in mind...

1108
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,830
Hello, Sakuma?

1109
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,380
What're you starting now?

1110
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,130
A war.

1111
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,330
Do you think this will do for the bedside decorations?

1112
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,080
Well, I guess it will do.

1113
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:02,180
Even though she's passed on, her face looks so peaceful.

1114
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,180
It does.

1115
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,180
I dunno if this'll fit.

1116
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:16,780
You have things like this in stock?

1117
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:20,180
"Electronics store" doesn't just mean household appliances.

1118
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,580
Actually we sell stuff to schools and government agencies too.

1119
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,050
This was actually slated for a university.

1120
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,880
Is it okay to use it?

1121
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,280
It's fine. We're just borrowing it for a bit.

1122
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,030
But why did he suddenly decide on this?

1123
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:39,030
It's all thanks to you standing up to the women, Kenji-kun.

1124
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,480
Kazuma must've seen that as a motivator.

1125
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,020
The women of our clan are strong and assertive,

1126
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,450
so the menfolk tend to be more passive.

1127
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,880
Now I need a source of electricity...

1128
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,830
Outta the way!

1129
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,850
Great, isn't it? This is my boat.

1130
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,080
Takes 2 hours to get here from Niigata.

1131
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,630
It can put out up to 300 kilowatts!

1132
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,390
Watch out, you two.

1133
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,630
I'm gonna dunk it.

1134
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,280
Incredible.

1135
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,680
What is this?

1136
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,280
A military-grade antenna module.

1137
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,080
Borrowed it from the American base in Matsumoto.

1138
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:42,370
What exactly do you do in the JSDF, Riichi-san?

1139
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,880
That's classified.

1140
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,670
What's gotten into those men?

1141
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,590
- It's a big jeep!
- Look outside!

1142
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,630
Don't make such a commotion!

1143
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,430
Behave yourselves, children.

1144
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,030
Okay.

1145
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,380
Is it all right for us to just sit around like this?

1146
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,480
It's the mourning period. Calm down.

1147
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,910
3 days is a bit too long for my tastes.

1148
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,680
I keep thinking about my work.

1149
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,430
Forget that for now.

1150
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:13,530
That's not going to work.

1151
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:17,210
Grandma always told us to help those in need, didn't she?

1152
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:17,830
That's right.

1153
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,310
Everyone! Please listen to me!

1154
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,780
Yummy.

1155
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,380
Can't you help a little too, Naomi-san?

1156
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,830
I can't make food this good.

1157
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:32,630
What time is it?

1158
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:33,880
It's time!

1159
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,180
Yumi-san!

1160
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,530
Kazuma! Change your clothes, will you?

1161
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,430
Later.

1162
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,480
Kazuma-kun looks like he's really King Kazma.

1163
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,480
That child used to be quite weak.

1164
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,900
He learned Shaolin kung fu from his

1165
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:55,880
grandfather Mansuke in Niigata through OZ all the way from Nagoya.

1166
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,830
So that's why he called him Master.

1167
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,280
Don't touch anything!

1168
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:04,980
I mean it!

1169
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:06,170
We're not touching nothing!

1170
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,590
We're just looking!

1171
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:09,780
Keeping it cool's gonna be the problem.

1172
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,530
We don't have an air conditioner.

1173
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,310
I've got lots of ice in the boat.

1174
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,180
Follow me.

1175
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,280
LCD's response times are too slow.

1176
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,620
Do you have any HD CRT monitors?

1177
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,380
Course I do.

1178
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,830
Just what kind of people is Natsuki-sempai's family made of?

1179
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,100
We're just a normal civilian family.

1180
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,820
A 200 teraFLOPS supercomputer,

1181
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,980
and a 100 gig military-grade connection line.

1182
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,400
You're telling me that a normal family has that kinda stuff?

1183
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,930
I want to send a challenge.

1184
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,380
A challenge?

1185
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,390
Sent by King Kazma.

1186
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,480
"Don't expect it to be so easy this time."

1187
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,280
And how do you know that?

1188
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,710
Because I'm King Kazma.

1189
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,130
Tell me another one.

1190
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:54,580
Wait, really?

1191
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,980
Challenge

1192
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,220
Come to the OZ Coliseum today at noon (JST). King Kazma

1193
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,210
Master.

1194
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,880
Do you think I can win?

1195
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,520
You're all grown up now.

1196
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,680
You can decide the outcome by yourself.

1197
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,690
Grown up? But I'm only in middle school.

1198
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,030
You'll be a big brother soon.

1199
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,910
I didn't choose to be.

1200
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,710
And a little sister at that...

1201
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,380
It's not so bad having siblings.

1202
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,280
Even though you steal each other's snacks,

1203
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,590
fight every day,

1204
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:27,280
get sick of even seeing their faces...

1205
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,930
One minute left!

1206
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:31,330
I'm ready.

1207
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,540
Me too.

1208
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,540
We can win this time.

1209
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,880
Grit your teeth.

1210
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,180
Let's go together.

1211
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,980
The finals are now beginning.

1212
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,000
Ueda High is up against the favorites Matsushou Academy!

1213
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,680
If Ueda High can win this match, they'll advance

1214
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,110
to the nationals for the first time in 24 years.

1215
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,150
But Matsushou's quite strong.

1216
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,530
Will Ueda be able to pull it off?

1217
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,490
Grandma, please watch over Ryouhei!

1218
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,280
And we're just about to start!

1219
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,330
He came!

1220
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,670
Yeah!

1221
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,280
He's fast... he's really fast!

1222
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,110
I can do it.

1223
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,180
Don't let him run!

1224
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:30,410
Get him to the trap!

1225
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,780
I can take care of him by myself!

1226
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,860
He's controlling the stolen avatars.

1227
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:08,350
He can do that?

1228
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,370
Don't do it, Kazuma-kun!

1229
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,280
Run!

1230
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,020
Master!

1231
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,980
I'll keep him occupied, run!

1232
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:42,620
Master!

1233
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,310
I'm fine, get him to the trap!

1234
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:02,980
Got him.

1235
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:03,670
Sakuma!

1236
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,090
Right on schedule!

1237
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,580
We got him, Grandmother!

1238
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,130
Kazuma did it!

1239
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,080
Yorihiko-san's group! It's your turn!

1240
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,730
Leave it to us.

1241
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:11,580
We've been gaming for 30 years!
Don't underestimate us!

1242
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,980
Even though we haven't been playing as much lately...

1243
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,630
Our skills haven't rusted a bit!

1244
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:41,730
We did it!

1245
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,500
Is that daddy's avatar?

1246
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,380
I want that one too!

1247
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,690
Papa's awesome!

1248
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,130
Papa...

1249
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,680
Bottom of the eighth, and Ueda High is giving a stunning show!

1250
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,430
Yumi-san...

1251
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,480
Like a rat in a trap.

1252
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,040
It's just a matter of time now.

1253
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,180
What's happening?

1254
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,380
What's this?

1255
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,380
Something's wrong with the stage!

1256
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,180
What's going on?

1257
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,980
Tasuke-san, behind you!

1258
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,730
Behind you?

1259
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,180
What?

1260
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,540
Hot!

1261
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,780
It's about to go critical!

1262
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,320
Where'd all the ice go?

1263
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:38,480
We had lots more than this...

1264
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,620
Shouta-nii took it.

1265
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,080
What?!

1266
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,800
Is that cool enough, Grandma?

1267
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,780
They say today's the hottest day of summer.

1268
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,810
Top of the ninth, and Ueda's pitcher

1269
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:58,980
Jinnouchi is beginning to crack.

1270
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,680
He looks very tired, doesn't he?

1271
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,920
Ryouhei!

1272
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,530
And Matsushou continues their offensive!

1273
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,160
These are all the avatars he's absorbed!

1274
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,370
More than 400 million!

1275
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,930
Kazuma-kun, run!

1276
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,100
Kazuma-kun!

1277
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:48,730
It's so hot that Grandma might start to rot,

1278
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,380
and here you guys are playing games.

1279
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,330
...all because of you...

1280
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,080
Huh? What was that?

1281
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,830
This is all your fault!

1282
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,030
This is because you...!

1283
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:01,230
Stop, Kazuma-kun!

1284
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,730
What's the deal!

1285
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,400
Are you okay, Shouta-nii?

1286
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,740
Everything's gone to hell since you showed up!

1287
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,220
Natsuki getting all weird!

1288
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,480
Grandma died!

1289
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,480
Now Kazuma's hitting me!

1290
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,750
Shouta-nii...

1291
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,180
Wha, what's happening?

1292
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,180
The world clock is...

1293
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,980
going haywire.

1294
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,220
What kind of countdown is this?

1295
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:05,650
Why...

1296
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,780
These are nuclear reactors.

1297
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,730
This is bad.

1298
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,530
The American military's secret communication lines are going wild.

1299
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,130
Japan's planetary probe Arawashi

1300
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,970
is plummeting to Earth, completely out of control.

1301
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:27,280
Arawashi can change its course through GPS coordinates.

1302
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,080
If that thing is in control of Arawashi...!

1303
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:32,530
Then this countdown is...

1304
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,510
It's telling the time until Arawashi falls

1305
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,180
onto one of the world's 500 plus nuclear facilities.

1306
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,280
What an exhilarating match!

1307
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:46,700
The finals are going into overtime!

1308
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:48,020
Save us! Save the world!

1309
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:51,130
The road to the nationals is indeed fraught with peril!

1310
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:54,560
The pressure on these high schoolers must be incredible!

1311
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,830
As you'll recall, Ueda's pitcher Jinnouchi
allowed 30 hits in yesterday's semi-finals.

1312
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:01,660
Today, he must pitch 15 extended innings on his own.

1313
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,080
Ryouhei!

1314
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:07,580
Today, in the final match,
will his mind and body be up to the challenge?

1315
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,520
To my family

1316
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,770
This is...

1317
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,430
Grandma's...

1318
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,510
Wait, Natsuki!

1319
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,160
Natsuki!

1320
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,930
- Wait!
- Where are you going?

1321
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,000
Everyone!

1322
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,430
A game?

1323
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:39,580
It's playing a game with people's lives?

1324
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,130
You...

1325
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:43,680
You've got to be kidding me.

1326
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,300
This is all just a game to him.

1327
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,280
It has no ideals, no hatred.

1328
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:52,130
The Americans are frantic right now.

1329
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:56,230
They never imagined that their test could have

1330
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:57,640
lead to this.

1331
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,780
An object with a diameter of 1 meter falling at 7 km per second

1332
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,580
packs the same force as a meteor or ballistic missile.

1333
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:09,380
If it falls on a power plant and there's nuclear fallout,

1334
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,230
the damage caused will be unimaginable.

1335
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,240
Then what do we do?

1336
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,380
It's managed to steal 38% of the currently existing

1337
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:24,380
King Kazma, kill that monster!

1338
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,780
number of accounts on OZ, 412 million!

1339
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,710
We have to find the one among those
that can set Arawashi's GPS coordinates.

1340
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,380
In 2 hours.

1341
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,330
How're we going to find one account among 400 million?!

1342
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:33,480
But there's no other way.

1343
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:34,640
Kazuma.

1344
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,030
What's going on?

1345
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,880
You're just talking about a game, right?

1346
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,840
Right?

1347
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,830
Don't go, King!

1348
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,630
It's useless!

1349
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,680
Shut up!

1350
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:34,930
Grandma...

1351
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,780
I'm sorry.

1352
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:41,930
I couldn't save mom...

1353
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,930
I couldn't save my little sister.

1354
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:02,580
Wabisuke's the only one who could do something now, but...

1355
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,930
There's no way he'd come back.

1356
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,580
We haven't lost yet.

1357
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:20,180
Kenji-kun.

1358
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,780
We lost.

1359
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,030
No we didn't.

1360
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,280
I told you, we lost!

1361
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,080
I'm telling you, we haven't.

1362
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,930
There's got to be some other way to solve this problem.

1363
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,330
What do you mean?

1364
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,660
This ain't math.

1365
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,400
It's the same.

1366
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:35,980
You can't solve an equation by giving up.

1367
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,730
We just haven't found the answer yet.

1368
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,580
You...

1369
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,330
Natsuki!

1370
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:15,230
How'd you find this address, Natsuki?

1371
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,130
Where are you right now?

1372
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:17,110
What's it to you?

1373
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,950
And how'd you find out the password to my cell?

1374
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:20,730
Come back!

1375
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,280
Grandma told you to do this, didn't she.

1376
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,290
Listen.

1377
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,620
I'm not going back.

1378
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,430
Not as long as she's still there.

1379
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,500
Please, listen to me.

1380
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:33,580
I never would've gone back if I'd known it was her birthday.

1381
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,730
Ojisan!

1382
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,480
Come now!

1383
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,380
You don't even know what's happened!

1384
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,930
What's the matter.

1385
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,380
Grandma passed away.

1386
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:58,080
She had a weak heart.

1387
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,980
Mansaku-ojisan couldn't help her in time because of OZ acting up.

1388
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,780
Grandma's...

1389
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,630
Grandma's dead?

1390
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,380
You were lying when you said you didn't know it was her birthday.

1391
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,980
The password was August 1st!

1392
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,380
You came back for her birthday, didn't you?

1393
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,880
Didn't you!

1394
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,080
Please...

1395
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,300
Come back just once and bid her goodbye!

1396
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:46,580
To my family:

1397
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,530
First, I must ask you to calm down.

1398
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:55,810
It's important for everyone to compose themselves.

1399
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,130
I want the funeral to be a small, family affair,

1400
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:02,940
and I wish for all of you to go about your lives as normal.

1401
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,300
I don't have anything material to leave behind for you,

1402
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,010
but the people I've come to know over the course of my life

1403
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:13,770
will do their best to help you get along. Don't worry.

1404
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:17,480
Everyone, work diligently and live your lives to the fullest.

1405
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:19,320
And...

1406
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,220
And if Wabisuke should ever come home,

1407
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,780
though it's anyone's guess as to when
he'll come after having been gone for 10 years,

1408
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:42,720
if he should ever come back home, I'm sure he'll be hungry,

1409
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:51,560
so feed him well with vegetables from
the fields, and the grapes and pears.

1410
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:57,430
I can remember the day I first met him.

1411
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:01,610
His ears looked so much like his father's that I was surprised.

1412
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,030
As we walked along the fields,

1413
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:08,760
when I told him, "You're going to be part of my family from now on,"

1414
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:14,080
he didn't reply, but didn't let go of my hand.

1415
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,920
I felt as though my happiness that he was now my son

1416
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:22,760
was reaching him through that.

1417
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,430
Family should never let go of one another.

1418
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,720
You must never admit defeat in life.

1419
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,680
And though you may come upon hard and painful times,

1420
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:40,930
I want you all to sit together and eat as a family.

1421
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,940
The worst things in this world

1422
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:47,430
are being hungry and being alone.

1423
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:56,400
I was glad to have had you all.

1424
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,230
Thank you.

1425
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,420
Goodbye.

1426
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,300
Ojisan!

1427
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,180
Grandma! Grandma!

1428
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,280
Wabisuke, pay your respects to Grandmother.

1429
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:33,180
And after that...

1430
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,180
let's all have lunch together.

1431
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,420
Ryouhei, you can do it!

1432
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,760
Yumi-san, come!

1433
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,920
But I'm still watching!

1434
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,880
Grandma, I'm home.

1435
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,680
It's going for a nuclear power plant?

1436
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:06,780
That's horrible!

1437
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,380
Yeah, this is an emergency.

1438
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,880
Can we sit around and eat like this?

1439
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,430
It was part of her will.

1440
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:12,780
It's really strong, right?

1441
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:15,430
In summer of 1615, at the battle of Osaka,

1442
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,290
we fought against Tokugawa's vast army of 15,000.

1443
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:19,870
But we lost!

1444
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,580
We can't fight just because it looks like we'll win

1445
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,210
and run just because it looks like we'll lose.

1446
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,710
We've fought through losing wars before.

1447
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,880
Every time.

1448
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,220
Our family was so stupid!

1449
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,420
Right, and we're the descendants of those people.

1450
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:35,260
Yeah, and I'm one of those idiots, eh.

1451
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,380
Still, we've got some kind of plan, right?

1452
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,770
I'm going to try and dismantle him remotely.

1453
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:44,180
I don't know whether or not I'll have the time.

1454
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,770
This all came about because of the stolen accounts.

1455
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:49,850
We've got another plan that'll work in our favor.

1456
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:51,230
Work in our favor?

1457
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:53,230
You said he liked playing games, right?

1458
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,920
It's this.

1459
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:58,980
You've got one hour left!

1460
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:09,010
Welcome to the OZ Casino Stage.

1461
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:17,180
Do you really want other people's accounts so badly?

1462
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,680
Fine. I'll give you mine.

1463
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:30,480
But you have to win against me first!

1464
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:34,280
Hanafuda has been selected.

1465
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,100
What will the wager be?

1466
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:38,580
My wager will be...

1467
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,180
my family!

1468
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:45,420
We'll play with our accounts on the line!

1469
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,650
All of your accounts are in my hands.

1470
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:51,630
Grandma, please watch over us!

1471
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,880
Hanafuda, huh. Suits our family.

1472
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:58,570
Wabisuke-san, I want you to work on destroying it while they go at it.

1473
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,720
But do you think he'll agree to this match?

1474
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,180
We only number 20 people, including Sakuma-kun.

1475
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,850
Isn't that a bit small of a wager?

1476
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,950
Shut up!

1477
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,620
Small or not, these are our lives!

1478
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,080
Bring it on!

1479
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,880
Let's fight!

1480
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,610
He'll come.

1481
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,920
No doubt about it.

1482
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:19,480
A player has joined the game.

1483
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,080
He's here!

1484
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,580
Fight, Natsuki!

1485
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:25,100
The fate of the world's in your hands!

1486
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,920
Casino rules apply to this stage.

1487
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:30,880
The pot doubles with each call of koi koi.

1488
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:34,160
The winner of the game takes all.

1489
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,970
Deciding initiative.

1490
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,020
Natsuki-san will go first.

1491
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:41,010
Now, the game will begin.

1492
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:47,700
That one!

1493
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:48,640
The cherry petals!

1494
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:49,490
No!

1495
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,250
That one!

1496
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:51,650
Quiet down a little!

1497
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:54,110
Blue ribbons!

1498
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,110
Koi koi?

1499
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,150
Koi koi!

1500
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,550
Koi koi!

1501
01:32:58,170 --> 01:32:59,500
Natsuki-san, koi koi.

1502
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:01,480
3 bright.

1503
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,600
Koi koi?

1504
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:05,380
Ribbon. Koi koi?

1505
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,550
Natsuki-san wins.

1506
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:08,710
All right!

1507
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,880
This is great.

1508
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,460
He's completely new to this.

1509
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:15,400
Don't take us lightly, we've been
training under Grandma since we were kids!

1510
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:18,130
26 accounts have been transferred.

1511
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,350
26 out of 400 million.

1512
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:22,390
Next round!

1513
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,310
Natsuki-san, you have initiative. Set the wager.

1514
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:27,500
3 bright.

1515
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:28,810
Viewing the cherry blossoms.

1516
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:30,010
4 bright.

1517
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:32,620
Five 10s.

1518
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:33,500
Rainy 4 bright.

1519
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,780
Boar-Deer-Butterfly.

1520
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,950
Natsuki-san wins.

1521
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:40,980
Natsuki-san raises the bet.

1522
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,620
Koi koi!

1523
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,580
Koi koi!

1524
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,240
Koi koi!

1525
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:47,340
Natsuki-sempai's incredible.

1526
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:50,780
She's already gotten back 300,000 avatars.

1527
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:53,670
But we still don't have the account we need!

1528
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:54,500
Wabisuke-san!

1529
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:07,080
- Viewing the cherry blossoms.
- No!

1530
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:09,600
Unknown-san requests a showdown.

1531
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,240
Natsuki-san loses.

1532
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,320
The wager will be transferred.

1533
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:24,280
Natsuki-san has 74 OZ accounts remaining.

1534
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,470
This is bad! Half an hour's gone by!

1535
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,000
You do not have enough wager to continue play.

1536
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,120
Will you end the game?

1537
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,080
You do not have enough wager to continue play.

1538
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,130
Will you end the game?

1539
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:12,280
Natsuki, please use my account.

1540
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,780
It's a boy living in Germany.

1541
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,500
Who?

1542
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,880
Is he a fan of Kazuma's?

1543
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,920
I don't know.

1544
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,330
Unbelievable.

1545
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:47,320
This represents 13.837% of OZ's total subscription!

1546
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,560
More than 150 million accounts!

1547
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,080
Why're they...

1548
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,280
It must be because Natsuki's pretty.

1549
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,730
I'll give you my account

1550
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:01,980
so please save

1551
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:05,380
my precious family.

1552
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:51,100
What's with the light show?

1553
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,930
OZ's guardian spirits have given Natsuki a rare item.

1554
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,270
I don't know what's going on, but...

1555
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,100
Thank you!

1556
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,530
Unknown-san raises the bet.

1557
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:09,580
1 point is 10 million avatars.

1558
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:10,420
10 million!

1559
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,430
He wants to end it.

1560
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,320
Let the game begin.

1561
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,380
3 bright.

1562
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,280
Boar-Deer-Butterfly.

1563
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:27,580
Koi!

1564
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:29,970
Red poetry ribbons.

1565
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:30,630
Koi!

1566
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,350
Rainy 4 bright.

1567
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,070
Koi!

1568
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,470
Koi!

1569
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,980
Koi!

1570
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:44,130
Go!

1571
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,380
Natsuki, get him!

1572
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,580
Do it!

1573
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,380
Finish it, sempai!

1574
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,320
Kill him!

1575
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:03,710
5 bright.

1576
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,830
Natuki-san wins. Accounts will be transferred.

1577
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,880
It...

1578
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,470
It...

1579
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,730
stopped.

1580
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,680
All right!

1581
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,270
We did it!

1582
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,530
Hooray!

1583
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:49,270
Sempai!

1584
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:52,230
Kenji-kun.

1585
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,380
I...

1586
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,630
I...

1587
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:58,740
I did it!

1588
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,870
Wha...Sempai!

1589
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:03,680
Wait!

1590
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,610
Something's wrong.

1591
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:05,620
Huh?

1592
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:09,210
The countdown isn't stopping!

1593
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,380
Huuuh!?

1594
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:11,880
That makes no sense!

1595
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,350
The world clocks everywhere else have already stopped.

1596
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,030
Why only here?

1597
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,870
He's going to drop Arawashi here?

1598
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:40,530
Looks like it!

1599
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:42,800
Are you shitting me?!

1600
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,280
Haven't you pulled that thing apart yet?

1601
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,500
I'm trying!

1602
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:47,680
10 minutes!

1603
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:49,670
It's too late to change the thing's course now.

1604
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,530
Everyone stay calm and evacuate.

1605
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:53,360
Tell the neighbors.

1606
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:55,330
We don't know how bad the damage will be.

1607
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,150
Let's go!

1608
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,720
Is our house gonna blow up?

1609
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:01,650
We'd be lucky if it ended with the house!

1610
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,280
Grandma, what do we do with this?

1611
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,770
Take it with you, of course!

1612
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:06,980
Mother, the bankbook!

1613
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,860
Natsuki! Move it!

1614
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:11,940
Natsuki!

1615
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:18,160
Did he leave any logs behind in the control sector?

1616
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:19,070
Let me see!

1617
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:20,530
Are you still trying to do something?

1618
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,530
They said you can't change its course.

1619
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:26,290
Riichi-san, you said that Arawashi's course
could be changed with GPS coordinates, right?

1620
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:26,980
Yeah.

1621
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:31,210
We can send its GPS false information just like he did yesterday!

1622
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:32,420
It's here.

1623
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:33,750
You can see its footprints!

1624
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,400
If you induce an error in the landing information...

1625
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:38,510
You might be able to change its course a bit!

1626
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,850
But I don't know if it'll work or not, so everyone get clear.

1627
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,870
Kenji-kun.

1628
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:45,560
Hurry, you all!

1629
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:46,640
Hurry!

1630
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,310
We haven't lost yet!

1631
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,120
What happened here?

1632
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:55,030
This is it!

1633
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,570
Why...?

1634
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,630
The password's been changed.

1635
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:02,200
He's trying to stop you!

1636
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:03,870
That can't be...

1637
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,480
Calm down! We're right here with ya!

1638
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:09,920
You can do it.

1639
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:10,710
Do it!

1640
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:12,580
Okay!

1641
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,730
Do your best!

1642
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:29,380
Okay!

1643
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,110
It's open!

1644
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,530
That was fast.

1645
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:40,950
We're locked out!

1646
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,680
Damn it!

1647
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:42,730
Once more!

1648
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:46,970
Kazuma!

1649
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:48,920
I lowered his defense stats to zero!

1650
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,710
Blow him to bits!

1651
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:03,380
Off you go!

1652
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:05,850
Master!

1653
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,730
2 minutes left!

1654
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,410
It's open!

1655
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,230
Not again!

1656
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:48,480
He's doing the calculations in his head?

1657
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,060
1 minute!

1658
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,730
Stop getting in the waaaay!

1659
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,630
Please let this work!

1660
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:37,530
It's a hot spring!

1661
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,870
A hot spring!

1662
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,710
A hot spring appeared!

1663
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,980
Ueda High pulls off a miraculous comeback!

1664
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:49,530
Advancing to the nationals for the first time in 24 years,

1665
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:52,110
After a grueling 15 overtime innings,

1666
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:56,630
the mound is swarmed with victorious players!

1667
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:00,050
Shouts of joy are filling the stadium!

1668
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:15,530
Happy birthday to you,

1669
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:20,130
happy birthday to you.

1670
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:26,590
Happy birthday, dear Grandma.

1671
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:34,180
Happy birthday to you!

1672
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,970
Happy birthday!

1673
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:49,630
Natsuki!

1674
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,320
Come on, don't cry, Ryouhei.

1675
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,410
It moved! That's weird!

1676
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:04,500
She's saying, "Thank you."

1677
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,090
Dad!

1678
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,300
You did good.

1679
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:26,310
I saw Wabisuke-san on the news.

1680
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:29,280
He came forward by himself, didn't he?

1681
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,180
However, the professor only designed the A.I. Love Machine,

1682
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,120
and the American military is responsible for turning it loose.

1683
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,080
Though thankfully there were no casualties,

1684
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,880
it is clear that the organizations responsible for this incident

1685
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,000
will have to take responsibility for their actions.

1686
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:51,900
Ah, right. Tell Kenji

1687
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,880
he doesn't have to come back for a while.

1688
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:56,080
He says you don't have to come back.

1689
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:57,370
No, but I have to.

1690
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,330
How about you two marry for real?

1691
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,730
But you have to start dating first, right?

1692
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,080
What do you think?

1693
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,330
If you say you like her, I'll kill you!

1694
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,630
Do you hate Natsuki?

1695
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:09,230
I'll kill you if you say that, too!

1696
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:11,110
I-I love her!

1697
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:13,070
You bastard!

1698
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:16,730
I'm glad.

1699
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,200
Thank you.

1700
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:23,710
Kiss, kiss!

1701
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:25,500
Hey, you!

1702
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:26,680
I'll arrest ya!

1703
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,030
My nose!

1704
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,080
What a wimp!
