2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,920
<i>Really? Does she really exist?</i>

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,670
<i>I wonder.</i>

4
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,510
<i>You didn't listen your parents either, right?</i>

5
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>What are you saying, Chiyomi?</i>

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,960
<i>You got married just because you had me, didn't you?</i>

7
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,310
<i>I want to get back to that time again.</i>

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,790
<i>I want to become small again.</i>

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,040
<i>Minami-kun...</i>

10
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,870
<i>Where are you, Chiyomi?</i>

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,020
<i>Here! I'm over here! Minami-kun!</i>

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
<i>You're in Tokyo?</i>

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,710
<i>Hey, what are you thinking?</i>

14
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,790
<i>So, I told you yesterday.</i>

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,930
<i>About the dance workshop.</i>

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,300
<i>Please let me stay with you.</i>

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>Hey, wait a minute. Why do you have to do that?</i>

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,630
<i>You know, my feelings can get hurt too.</i>

19
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,240
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,290
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,150
<i>No way. It's Horikiri Chiyomi. Chiyomi.</i>

22
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,070
<i>Right. We don't have a person named Horikiri-san or Chiyomi-san here.</i>

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,000
<i>This address...<br>[sender: issunhime@beeble.co.jp]</i>

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,120

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,330
One-inch Princess?

28
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,750
You know, a legendary princess around here who is like a dwarf.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,050
She said she saw her yesterday.

30
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,910
A princess like a dwarf?

31
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,320
Yesterday, she almost started a fire if Shunichi were not here.

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,210
She did?

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,240
<i>Grandma. You left a pot on the stove unattended.</i>

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>Eh?</i>

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,900
<i>Oh, it's you, Noboru.</i>

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>What?</i>

37
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,870
I'm glad she got better, but...

38
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,500
I see...

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,210
Then, I will come visit here when you are not home as often as possible.

40
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,750
Sorry, Ricchan. I know you're going through tough time because of Chiyomi-chan.

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,900
Don't worry. It will help me get my mind off of that, you know.

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,470
Well then, I'll get going.

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,070
-Thanks.<br>- Sure.

44
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,090
Obachan (auntie), I'll come visit again.

45
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,390
Okay, see you.

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm sorry, Mom.

70
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,580
Grandma saw you, didn't she?

71
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,760
She will want to see you again and look for you.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,410
She'll look for One-inch Princess. Not me.

73
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,100
She is losing her mind now, so it might be okay...

74
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,670
No, it won't be okay. Not at all.

75
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,300

It sucks!

79
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,750
It's meaningless to come to school if I can't smell her.

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,750
<i>Oh, yeah? Good for you.</i>

81
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,140
<i>I finally received an e-mail from Horikiri-shi a while ago.</i>

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,810
What did she say?

83
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,050
She only wrote about the workshop.

84
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,460
She said it's been hard but fun. I'm relieved she's doing well.

85
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,020
Well, I don't mean to be gready but wanted to receive a video.

86
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,120
You know, about the workshop...

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah?

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,710
Actually, it seems she has not been attending the workshop.

89
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,120
What?

90
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,670
<i>[Legend of One-inch Princess]</i>

91
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,860
Takagi-kun.

92
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,040
Sensei.

93
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,550
Oh, so you have known that Moon Bunny Michaela was Horikiri-san.

94
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,940
Yes.

95
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,070
She must have based "Chobiko in a Pocket" on this.

96
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,830
The setting of the stories are similar.

97
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,480
I wonder why Horikiri-san started writing a new story though.

98
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,590
"Blue Fairy" was getting into a really interesting part of the story.

99
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:07,950
Perhaps, something happened to her state of mind, I think.

100
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,660
Something happened to her state of mind...?

101
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,020
<i>When I wrote what's been collecting inside me, it happend...</i>

102
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,630
<i>I guess that is a mental scenary that is inside your heart.</i>

103
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,840
"Chobiko in a Pocket"...

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,710
That must be the mental scenary in her mind right now.

105
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,830
Could it be that she became Chobiko?

106
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,150
Eh?

107
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,340
I'm kidding.

108
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,830
Oh, but it could be...

109
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,660
What?

110
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,060
Horikiri-shi might be having impossible love.

111
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,550
What makes you say so?

112
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,910
Chobiko loves the big guy who she can't possibly be together with.

113
00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:01,370
The gap in the height of them might represent the alienation she feels for him from not being able to be with him.

114
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,370
I see...

115
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,800
If that's the case, who is the big guy?

116
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,970
Could the big guy be...?

117
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay, I'm going.

118
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,550
I'm borrowing this first. I'll give it to you when I'm done.

119
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,550
Okay.

120
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,920
He has also been reading it?

121
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,870
Did he get inspired, after reading it, to make the figurine, like me?

122
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,330
One-inch Princess, come on out.

123
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,420

124
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,010
There you are!

125
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,680
Did you make this for me, Grandma?

126
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,870
Well, One-inch Princess should be dressed like that, you know.

127
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,380
I'm so happy. It's beautiful. Thank you so much.

128
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,080
I am really happy. <br>(She's using old Japanese.)

129
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,680
Oh? Someone came.

130
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,430
<i>It's Mitsuko.</i>

131
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,000
Coming.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
- Hide somewhere a bit, okay?<br>- Yup.

133
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,830
I think he doesn't want to see my face.

134
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,700
Why? You used to get along well.

135
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,460
Well, I wonder if he hasn't loved me that much from the beginning.

136
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,120
He used to love someone very much.

137
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Because she broke his heart, he just got together with me who was around him.

138
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,750
Okay, it's ready.

139
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,390
It must be under there.

140
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,960
<i>We got two children, and the restaurant business keeps us busy.</i>

141
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,290
<i>So, I have been living, not thinking about those things.</i>

142
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,870
But, since Chiyomi's gone, I see him more often now.

143
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,540
Consequently, we've been fighting a lot.

144
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,540
But, Master has been really in love with you since he married you, hasn't he?

145
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,000
That's not true. Because... I haven't been proposed.

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,080
<i>- What?</i><br>- What!?

147
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,290
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

148
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,290
Yeah. It's just that, since we had Chiyomi, we decided to to the right thing.

149
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,410
So, it was true that they had a shotgun wedding.

150
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,080
That stupid Joji.

151
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,830
Sorry to say such a thing about your husband.

152
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,140
I just remembered his face from the time when he was a mischievous rascal.

153
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,410
Don't worry about it. 'Stupid Joji' is good enough.

154
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,450
But, you know, that 'stupid Joji,'

155
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,700
I was happy he got serious about working ever since he married you.

156
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Before that, he... What was it? He...

157
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,450
Heavy metal?

158
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,080
Heavy metal?

159
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,830
That's right. 'Stupid Joji' used to play heavy metal rock.

160
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,250
He sang, dressed in such crazy fashion like this.

161
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:49,190
He didn't work hard, despite his age, and said he would go to Tokyo and have success.

162
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,870
<i>Tokyo? Dad...</i>

163
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,040
<i>♫Ah~! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I'm... I'm... Come on!</i>

164
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,350
No way. It's not possible.

165
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,480
But, since he married you, he has worked really hard.

166
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,160
He saved up money for down payment and opened a restaurant.

167
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,450
So, he is who he is today

168
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,540
all thanks to you, Ricchan.

169
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,790
That's not true.

170
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,000
You know, Ricchan,

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,480
you got together with him because you loved him very much, didn't you?

172
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,250
Mom.

173
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,290
I think so.

174
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,160
See? The fact that you got jealous now

175
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,700
proves that you love him. Don't you think so?

176
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,860
I am not sure about it now.

177
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,270
You've been working too hard.

178
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,750
What?

179
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,250
You should slack off a bit.

180
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,150
Slacking off,

181
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,540
it is also important.

182
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,420
Why desn't she reply to me?

183
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,490
<i>My Little Lover<br>Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

184
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,710
- Welcome home, Shunichi.<br>- Hello there.

185
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,910
Hello.

186
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,670
<i>What should I do? Minami-kun's home.</i>

187
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,580
Thank you, you two.

188
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,160
You helped me a lot. This is a thank you gift. Why don't you put it in your shop?

189
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,990
- Wow, it's great.<br>- Thank you.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,710
Not at all.

191
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,850
Alstroemeria is called 'Lily of the Incas' and 'Peruvian Lily.' It's flower meaning is...<br>

192
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,000
You don't have to tell me. I won't be able to memorize it.

193
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,870
It's no good. She doesn't pick up the phone.

194
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, you are Chiyomi's... It's been long.

195
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,140
- Hello.<br>- Hello.

196
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,580
Could it be...

197
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,200
she went there again?

198
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,200
- Here you go. <br>- Thanks.

199
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,810
Oh, Minami-kun.

200
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,730
Hello.

201
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,250
- Oh, hi.<br>- Hello.

202
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,330
- Want some cake?<br>- No, I'll drink something.

203
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,560
Wow, it's unusual.

204
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:15,080
- You usually have a takeout.<br>- I wanted to have a coffee break.

205
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,750
- Here you go.<br>- Well then, may I have ice coffee?<br>- Sure.

206
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,340
- It makes me so happy.<br>- Chiyomi...

207
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,260
Where is she?

208
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,410
Minami-kun, you are doing great.

209
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,950
I heard you've been studying.

210
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,080
I wish Chiyomi would learn from you.

211
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,040
<i>I can't expect too much from her because she is my daughter.</i>

212
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,700
<i>I hope she would go to college at least.</i>

213
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,700
But, Chiyomi-san is a hardworking person, too.

214
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,790
She might not be good at studying,

215
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,750
but she is talented in other areas, like writing...

216
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,370
Oh, well, you know,

217
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,580
she has actually been working hard to pursue her dream to be a dancer.

218
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,540
- Riku.<br>- I respect her

219
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,710
who has that aspect.

220
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay, here’s your ice coffee.

221
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>Minami-kun. Grandma saw me a while ago.</i>

222
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,040
Chiyomi... She was found by Grandma again?

223
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,040
You are Takagi-kun, right? Thank you.

224
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,400
Thank you for worrying about Chiyomi like that.

225
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,290
- Thank you for the coffee.<br>- That was quick.

226
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:57,580
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

227
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,920
Oh, Minami-kun.

228
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,710
- Sorry I stayed long.<br>- It's okay.

229
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,500
Your grandma gave me energy.

230
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,290
- Well then, excuse me.<br>- Oh, okay.

231
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,210
It's okay now, One-inch Princess.

232
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry we talked so long.

233
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,750
It's been like this whenever Ricchan comes here.

234
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,120
But, since she comes with gifts, I feel okay about it.

235
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
So long now.

236
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,290
We couldn't tell them after all.

237
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,000
That's because I started talking like that. I'm sorry.

238
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,620
It can't be helped. I'll bet Chiyomi had a reason to tell a lie.

239
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,700
Yeah.

240
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,870
But, should we have told them anyway?

241
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,710
That Chiyomi hasn't been attending the workshop?

242
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,650
Where in the world is Chiyomi?

243
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,700
What do you mean by that?

244
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,940
Hey, what do you mean by that?

245
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,100
You know, I used to get jealous of Noboru. He was smart and good-looking.

246
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,480
- Right.<br>- He won the national Kendo championship.<br>-Yup.

247
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,450
Imagine how it was to have a neighbor like him.

248
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,290
- On top of that, his wife was Emi-chan.<br>- Yeah, Emi-chan.

249
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,910
When we were in high school,

250
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,580
- we used to ride a train to go see Emi-chan.<br>- That's right.

251
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,080
Everyone was talking about her then.

252
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,450
But, that bastard Noboru...

253
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,500
Come on! You too have a cute wife.

254
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,680
Let me tell you something. Men are romantics.

255
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,450
We want to keep our sweet and sour memories.

256
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,200
<i>That's right.</i>

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,910
Oh.

258
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,870
Welcome back.

259
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,830
You're back, Ricchan.

260
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,040
Where have you been? It's been so busy here, but I couldn't get in touch with you.

261
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,160
I was at Obachan's (auntie) next door.

262
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,900
You were acting silly, saying "Emi-chan, Emi-chan" when we have a situation about Chiyomi.

263
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,620
Hey, stop that. We have customers. Talk about it later.

264
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,250
Later when? I know you're going drinking at night.

265
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,540
I got it. Don't talk about it now though.

266
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,950
Then when? When can we have a serious talk?

267
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,540
Chiyomi... she hasn't been attending the workshop.

268
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,160
What? Then, where is Chiyomi?

269
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,260
Have no idea. Why don't you find her?

270
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,850
You have no idea? It's about our child!

271
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,120
You are so quick to lose it like that. I can't take it anymore.

272
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,290
Oh, hey.

273
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,660
That "Obi" is looks good, too.

274
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,790
Oh, that's right. I have tasty "yokan" (Japanese sweet made of red bean paste)

275
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,540
I'm going to cut some, so wait a minute.

276
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,790
Hey.

277
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,410
Oh, Minami-kun.

278
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,730
What are you doing? I told you not to get around.

279
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,750
Sorry.

280
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,910
<i>Yes.</i>

281
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,080
There are so many guests today.

282
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,660
This is our chance. Come here.

283
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,350
- But, Grandma will...<br>- Ha?

284
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,160
Yes.

285
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,870
Oh, Asuka-chan.

286
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,910
Hello. Is Oni-chan (big brother) here?

287
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,190
He just went out, but I'm sure he'll be back soon.

288
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,580
- Why don't you come in and wait.<br>- Yes.

289
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,700
<i>Come on in.</i>

290
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,250
Oh, Shuichi, you were here.

291
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,850
Oni-chan...

292
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,920
Asuka-chan.

293
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,790
I need to talk to you.

294
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,170
W, wait a second...

295
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,660
Ah.

296
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,790
<i>Minami-kun no Koibito<br>My Little Lover</i>

297
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,130
W, wait, Asuka-chan.

298
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,910
What's wrong?

299
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,120
Oni-chan, you know where Onee-chan (big sister) is, don't you?

300
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,790
Eh?

301
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,410
Are you concerned about something?

302
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,200
Eh?

303
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,830
Well, no...

304
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,790
It's fine... you can go.

305
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,120
Eh?

306
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,300
We can have Yokan later.

307
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,290
Onee-chan is using this tablet to send emails right?

308
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,440
Eh?

309
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,660
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,540
When I came over the other day, I saw it.

311
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,910
What?

312
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,820
The Email sent box was open.

313
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,500
Ouch!

314
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,580
Ouch...

315
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,370
The email was Onee-chan's address.

316
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,100
Asuka-chan... that is... well...

317
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,410
Onee-chan used this, right?

318
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,450
It's impossible for her to not use this.

319
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,250
Please, Oni-chan, if you know where Onee-chan is, can you please tell me?

320
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,250
Our home is a mess because Onee-chan isn't there.

321
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,520
Asuka-chan...

322
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,170
You knew that Onee-chan didn't go to the (dance) workshop, right?

323
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,620
She's horrible...

324
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,340
Asuka-chan.

325
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,020
Chiyomi has her reasons.

326
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,870
But, she just can't say anything right now.

327
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,210
She's suffering too.

328
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,760
She struggling to figure out how to come with smiling.

329
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,910
So, can you...

330
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,910
can you wait just a little bit more?

331
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:25,700
Oni-chan, does that mean

332
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:37,910
you guys are... having a relationship?

333
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,500
Eh?

334
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,160
If you you two are talking about things that you can't tell parents or family...

335
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,610
Isn't that what it means?

336
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,410
Oni-chan?

337
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,740
Chiyomi is...

338
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,450
protect Chiyomi right now.

339
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:17,660
Right now, Chiyomi needs me.

340
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,960
Sorry for not saying anything until now.

341
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,910
I...

342
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,250
liked you...

343
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,370
What?

344
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,750
I liked you, too.

345
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,950
But forget it. Sorry.

346
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,410
I believe you.

347
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,290
Sorry to bother you.

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by <br>The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

349
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,660
Minami-kun.

350
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,700
Chiyomi.

351
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,210
Are you okay? You look like a defeated soldier.

352
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,000
This is... well...

353
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,080
What should we do now?

354
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,500
Grandma totally believes in your existence.

355
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,330
We can't fool her much longer.

356
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,270
Sorry...

357
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:18,190
Oh, by the way, I found out that Dad never proposed to my Mom.

358
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,530
Ha?

359
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,070
<i>Minami-kun no Koibito<br>My Little Lover</i>

360
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,630
<i>I know.. I get it.</i>

361
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,600
<i>- Right?<br>-Yeah.</i>

362
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,490
You know, when I married her

363
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,110
- I quit my favorite heavy metal music.<br>- Yeah, you did.

364
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,160
- And, I worked physical labor, and saved money...<br>- Yeah...

365
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,990
I opened the store.

366
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,030
- I'm selling Zakka (Various Goods) and flowers there.<br>- Yeah, you did.

367
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,390
I've been working hard!

368
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,180
Yeah, you are... You sure are!

369
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,320
- I haven't had an affair either.<br>-You're great. So great!

370
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,820
I could never do that.

371
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,750
Sure, sometimes, I may look at other women and get a weird smile.

372
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,380
- You mean Emi-chan!<br>-Yeah, it's Emi-chan!

373
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,360
<i> But I can smile like that because...</i>

374
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,390
<i>because I love my wife.</i>

375
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,810
<i>I get it!</i>

376
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,840
Yes, this is Izakaya (Japanese bar) Gantaro.

377
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,170
Who is this? I can't hear you very well.

378
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,730
That's right. That's something women just don't understand.

379
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,040
<i>Chiyomi-chan? Are you really Chiyomi-chan?</i>

380
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,760
Hey, it's Chiyomi-chan.

381
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,280
Why don't you get Etsu-chan. Tell her Chiyomi-chan is calling.

382
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,970
You're right.

383
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,070
Is this Chiyomi?

384
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,680
Dad.

385
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,850
<i>You idiot!</i>

386
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,510
Where are you? Is it true you are not at the workshop?

387
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,970
Where are you wandering around?

388
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,720
I am just wandering around... I can't tell you where I am though.

389
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,910
But, just like you tried to make your heavy metal dream come true

390
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,680
I am also struggling right now.

391
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,830
How do you know about that?

392
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:08,210
I know... that for mom and for us, you quit playing heavy metal music and

393
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,400
you worked really hard for us.

394
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,460
Is this room wired?

395
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,520
- What?<br>- Wired?

396
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,240
- Is there a bug?<br>- What?

397
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,340
Of course not.

398
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,540
But...

399
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,700
<i>Dad, are you listening?</i>

400
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,140
Yeah.

401
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,400
I know that you are working hard for Mom and for us

402
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,200
that you are always thinking about us.

403
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,340
I am really, really grateful.

404
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,740
Yeah.

405
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,240
<i>But, Mom is...</i>

406
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,420
Mom is much more girlie than you think.

407
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,960
Even now, she loves you very much.

408
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,320
<i>I think she gets insecure not knowing how you feel.</i>

409
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,440
<i>She's like that, but</i>

410
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,140
you be surprised how girlie she really is.

411
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,200
She's a girl.

412
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,220
Even now, she wants to believe that

413
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,380
you didn't marry her just because you had me.

414
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,460
She wants to believe that you got married

415
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,940
because you two were attracted to each other.

416
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,420
Um.

417
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,700
So,

418
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,120
So, please put your feelings in words.

419
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,250
In words?

420
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,850
Yeah.

421
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,450
Dad, that is so important for a girl.

422
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,170
I got it.

423
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,090
Thank you.

424
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,610
Bye.

425
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,730
<i>W, wait, Chiyomi.</i>

426
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,650
<i>You... I think you are misunderstanding...</i>

427
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,330
<i>so let me say this.</i>

428
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,810
Your Dad...

429
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,630
Your Dad did not marry your Mom because we had you.

430
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,550
It's because

431
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,630
I loved, and loved her a lot, and that's why I married her.

432
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,250
Even now.

433
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,410
I love your mom.

434
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,930
I've fallen for her.

435
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,010
Yeah.

436
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,090
Ritsuko...

437
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,010
Hey Dad... what's wrong?

438
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,810
Chiyomi, I forgot about something important.

439
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,320
No, actually, it's something I've been wondering for a while...

440
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,750
<i>Eh? What is it?</i>

441
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,170
Putting my wishes through these alstroemeria flowers.

442
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,790
I'm sorry for

443
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,010
not being able to say this until now.

444
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,630
Thank you so much for being with someone like me

445
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,330
for the last 18 years.

446
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,840
Will you...

447
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,060
Will you marry me?

448
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,060
No... please stay by my side forever.

449
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,760
What wish did you

450
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,520
make on this flower?

451
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,700
The language of flower for alstroemeria is

452
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,640
"Hope for the future"

453
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,040
"Self-sacrificing Love"

454
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,500
"Hope for the future"

455
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,820
"Self-sacrificing Love"

456
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,060
Look forward to being with you.

457
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,080
Stop it.

458
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,540
I rushed over, so look at what I'm wearing!

459
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,860
I accepted your proposal looking like this? Oh no.

460
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,180
Chiyomi's call.

461
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,740
Chiyomi? Chiyomi?

462
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,860
- Mom<br>-Chiyomi.

463
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm happy for you.

464
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,880
Chiyomi, thank you.

465
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,700
Chiyomi? Chiyomi!

466
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,080
What happened?

467
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,980
She hung up.

468
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,400
Oh boy, what's with her...

469
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,360
Well, but it turned out okay.

470
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,600
Chiyomi-chan was worried as well.

471
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,300
She is such a good kid.

472
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,400
To celebrate, why don't we have another round?

473
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,380
I'll prepare some feast.

474
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,480
How did... Onii-chan?

475
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,680
Get closer... get closer.

476
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,960
Ok, I'm going to take it.

477
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,040
You look stiff.

478
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,380
Where is Asuka-chan?

479
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,160
Oh? Where is Asuka-chan?

480
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,600
Where did she go?

481
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,440
- We're about to take a picture.<br>- Okay.

482
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,940
<i>Oh, Minami-kun!</i>

483
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,320
I brought him over.

484
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
It's better to have a bigger crowd.

485
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,100
He finally proposed to Ri-chan after being married for 18 years.

486
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,020
Let's take a picture.

487
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,960
Ok. Here we go.

488
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,140
<i>What? A picture?</i>

489
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,320
<i>Oh I see. I wish I could be in the picture.</i>

490
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,420
Ok, Ok...

491
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,660
Hey, why don't you get in the picture?

492
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,900
Eh? But...

493
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,220
Here.

494
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,240
I was shocked since you took me out of the pocket.

495
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,640
But because of that, you were in the important picture.

496
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,060
I know... but

497
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,020
if anyone noticed...

498
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,740
It's fine. No one will notice.

499
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,360
But...

500
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't worry. Even if we're busted,

501
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,900
I'll take responsibility and protect you.

502
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,580
What do you mean by protect me?

503
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,740
What the word means.

504
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,300
No... I don't want to misunderstand.

505
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,320
That's not what he meant...

506
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,620
But... What should I do?

507
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,460
I can't stop being excited.
