00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:23,561
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:29,611
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

4
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:34,381
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,111
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,961
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:45,621
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:52,631

9
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:58,831
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:04,101

dreaming all night, all night.</i>

11
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:09,481
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

12
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,761
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,531
What am I doing in a place like this?

17
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,761
That was the seventh time today.

18
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,531
I can't grasp it no matter
how many times it's said...

19
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:06,231
...but what I really can't grasp
is why she came along with us...

20
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:07,801
Better late than never.

21
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,971
I'm sorry...

22
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:10,641
Hey, isn't Kohsaka here yet?

23
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,251
Didn't he just message us
that he's in the parking lot?

24
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,481
So slow...

25
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,891
Today's the day I make my move!

26
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,811
I have a feeling it's
a waste of effort...

27
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,751
C'mon, let's go.

<i>Episode 10, The Fetishism of Leisure

29
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:38,731
It's embarrassing to go
to Comic Fest with a tan.

30
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,271
It sure is...

31
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,771
Well, we put on sunscreen...

32
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,711
There they are.

33
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,121
Let go of me, okay?

34
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,951
Aww, no, I can't...

35
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,051
Hello, could you do something about
her?

36
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:07,031
Wow, Ohno is, well...

37
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,601
The scary thing is,
she's not even trying...

38
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,971
Kugapee drove us here...

39
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,141
...but why did you guys come too?

40
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,271
Well, it's just how it happened.

41
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,311
One of these things is
not like the others.

42
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,781
So you came for real.

43
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:22,911
Hello.

44
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:24,811
Don't get too close.

45
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,151
I wouldn't get too close to you, sistah.

46
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:37,121
S-Sasahara, p-pull it a
l-little farther that way.

47
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,001
About here?

48
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,761
Look, it's all right.

49
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,601
The hotel back there keeps
a close eye on the beach.

00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,301
No weirdos are going to hit on
you. It's almost all families here.

51
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:52,011
You always wear embarrassing
things when you cosplay, you know.

52
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,721
That's different from this...

53
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,241
Besides, look.

54
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,881
If it comes down to it, we have
an entire squad of bodyguards!

55
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:10,931
In any case, let go of my hand.

56
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:14,231
Kohsaka and I are going swimming.

57
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:18,671
That's the way.

58
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:20,641
Hey, Kohsaka.

59
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,211
Let's go over this again.

60
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:29,651
Don't come within a ten meter
radius of me and Kohsaka!

61
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,781
I expected this to an extent...

62
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:37,321
Well, since we're watching the stuff, the
parasols at least can be close together.

63
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,991
What's with this difference
in population density?

64
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,051
Why do I gotta be on this side?

65
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,391
E-Everyone go do their thing.

66
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:48,031
I have to drive home, so
I'm conserving my energy.

67
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,671
I don't really know how to swim...

68
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:55,841
Comic Fest is next week, and
I won't be humiliated by a tan.

69
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,701
Well, there you have it.

70
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,011
Is that true?

71
00:04:59,121 --> 00:04:59,181
Come on, let's go.

72
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,771
<i>Yes, it is.
Come on, let's go.</i>

73
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,861
Oh, that was nothing.

74
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,701
M-Monkey...

75
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,431
Who'd help somebody
who calls them "monkey?"

76
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,371
Hey, are you just going
to sit here like this?

77
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,471
Yeah...

78
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:39,191
While I'm at it, I might as well
look at Comic Fest materials.

79
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:40,881
What, right here?

80
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,191
Oh, you've chosen your costume.

81
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,421
Which one are you doing?

82
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,291
I thought this might be good...

83
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,301
Ahh, but you'll need a long prop.

84
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,941
Her uniform is cute, though.

85
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:15,231
Let's go.

86
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,821
<i>W- Wait, wait!
Let's go.</i>

87
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,521
Seriously, please!

88
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:20,991
Can we hang out?

89
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,791
They're over there starting in on
the "Gungal Word Game" or something!

90
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,931
Hey, I want to play it too.

91
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:31,431
Come on, please.

92
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,481
I won't make any passes at him.

93
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,511
Fine, whatever...

94
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:37,341
Yes!

95
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:43,411
Oh come on, why not?

96
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,521
Amuro wants "Sayla's good
luck charm" in the novels!

97
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:49,751
Isn't that way too geeky?

98
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,961
Delving into the novels
is kind of abnormal!

99
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,121
How so?

100
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,291
Ahh, geez...

101
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,161
Why not "Sayla Mass?"

102
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,761
No way!
Don't make me checkmate you!

103
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,361
This is a time-honored
Japanese tradition!

104
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,841
Yes, I know that!

105
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,241
I will not yield!

106
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,311
Have it your way.

107
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,851
Then it's the "m" in "charm."

108
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,171
M-M-M-Mass
production model...

109
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,081
I'm kind of tired of this...

110
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:24,151
S-Since we're here, why
not go out there a bit?

111
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,191
I-I'll watch our things.

112
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:27,561
Oh, are you sure?

113
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:28,561
Yeah.

114
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:32,571
W-Why don't you go play
on the beach too, Ohno?

115
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,571
Okay, just for a bit.

116
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,171
Me too, then.

117
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,981
I'm not going!

118
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,451
Having a tan at Comic Fest is...

119
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,351
We know, it's embarrassing.

120
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,381
Suit yourself.

121
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,321
I-I...

122
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,281
Nice and cold!

123
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,601
If you stand in one place long enough...

124
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:09,441
If you stand in one place, the sand at
your feet steadily washes away.

125
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:12,541
Eh?
Oh, yeah it does...

126
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,341
The illusion of the waves help make it
seem like you're going to fall backwards.

127
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,351
O-Ohno?

128
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,381
Was that intentional?

129
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,451
She sure is a clever one...

130
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,611
Aw, I got my bottom wet...

131
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,551
A-Are you okay?

132
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:32,531
Yes...

133
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,131
Let's play in the sand some.

134
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,101
Good idea.

135
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,031
I can handle that...

136
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,871
I can see why Kasukabe
didn't want to be around us...

137
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,271
Yeah, really.

138
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,971
Kohsaka, how about lunch?

139
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:48,511
Hmm, what do you suppose we should
eat?

140
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,251
Look at that, you finally came out.

141
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,541
Well, it was inevitable.

142
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,651
After coming all this way...

143
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,451
It would've been a waste not to.

144
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,991
Weren't we supposed to stay
a 10m radius away from you?

145
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,021
Eh?

146
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,331
Oh, that was just a joke.

147
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,031
Kohsaka, would you like
to go get a cold drink?

148
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,171
That sounds good.

149
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,541
It's not a joke in your case.

150
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:21,571
Darn, maybe this is useless.

151
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,651
Huh? What gives?

152
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:29,681
Why are you here?

153
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,811
S-Same to you.

154
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:35,951
So that's how it is, huh?

155
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,031
No, that ain't how it is!

156
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,391
What's that supposed to mean?

157
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,291
It's none of your business.

158
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:45,691
You think you can talk to me that way?

159
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:47,241
I told you, you're wrong!

160
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,371
What the hell's with you?

161
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,731
Shouting annoys those around you.

162
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:03,121
Look buddy, we're friends
of this girl's brother!

163
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,281
He's here with us too.

164
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:06,621
Over there!

165
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,691
H-Hi...

166
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:16,731
Yeah, hi...

167
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,331
You didn't come here
alone either, right?

168
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,601
Let's not start any trouble in public.

169
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,641
I'll message you later.

170
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,241
Don't bother.

171
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,441
Damn, I am so fallin' for him.

172
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:39,781
You can move now!

173
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,051
Are you too stupid to
stay out of trouble?

174
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:45,261
That guy thinks he's a
bigshot for yelling at people!

175
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,221
Sorry, sorry...

176
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:51,091
You sure were quick to run.

177
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,291
Because I'm an unreliable bodyguard.

178
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:56,701
Are you okay?

179
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:57,531
Yeah...

180
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:06,651
I'm no match for her...

181
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,351
Don't destroy it, Saki.

182
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,621
Ah, yeah...

183
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,821
I would've already done it
back in grade school...

184
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,221
That's a closed club, there...

185
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:24,431
Sure is.

186
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,261
That's Cagliostro Castle.

187
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:29,071
It's true. They've even
built in the clock tower.

188
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,671
You mean The Shepherdess
and the Chimneysweep?

189
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,241
There you go again.

190
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:36,211
I'm an "originals only"
kind of guy at heart.

191
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,441
But you like Clarisse.

192
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,571
That's different!

193
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,651
I also like The Fuma Conspiracy.

194
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,811
You recognize the Furukawa Lupin?

195
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,561
It's a good movie, though.

196
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:51,351
For curveballs I'd love to give
the illusory Oshii version as an...

197
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,551
...example if it'd ever been completed.

198
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,661
Was something like that planned?

199
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,331
It was supposed to be the
third theatrical release...

200
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,831
...but that ended up being The
Legend of the Gold of Babylon...

201
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,131
Wish we could have seen that.

202
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:06,301
Well, no use figuring the
age of a dead child.

203
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,431
That's true.

204
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,311
I've got it!

205
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,571
A way to fight off Kasukabe...

206
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,121
Why'd you come to my place?

207
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,131
Who cares, just let me stay a while.

208
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,331
Huh?

209
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,601
I'm your little sister after all.

210
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:31,571
Well sure, of course you are.

211
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,691
That's where I have
an advantage, genetics.

212
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,431
So show me some videos, some anime.

213
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:40,541
But don't you hate them?

214
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:41,771
Just do it.

215
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:46,371
And no softy poser stuff,
I want hardcore otaku shows.

216
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,331
No!

217
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,371
If even one of us leaves
we'll be eliminated.

218
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,741
I can't go on.

219
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:13,471
I'm sorry I'm gutless,
but this is my limit.

220
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:15,271
Tokino!

221
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:17,541
Outside, outside, outside, outside.

222
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,451
Just hold out a little longer!

223
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,741
The heat must be getting
to our opponents too.

224
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,681
Let's talk about something,
to take our minds off the heat.

225
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,221
That won't work!

226
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,761
Shouldn't you just go to bed?

227
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:30,781
<i>Shut up!
Shouldn't you just go to bed?</i>

228
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,271
I want to go to Comic Fest too!

229
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:44,941
Ah, lately she's been watching
lots of stuff at my place.

230
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,671
Looks like she's picked up an interest.

231
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,911
Kujiun is such a great show...

232
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:52,871
Are you trying to become
otaku or something?

233
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,611
I guess it just seems to suit me.

234
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,251
Right, big bro?

235
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:58,721
Cut that out.

236
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:01,421
Are you aware of what's sold there?

237
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,391
Manga books, right?

238
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:03,291
Porn books!

239
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:04,291
Just a moment!

240
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:07,721
I know, I know, you're about
to say it's not all porn.

241
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,561
But what is it that you guys buy?

242
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,661
Porn books...

243
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,371
Want me to show you what they're like?

244
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,801
This place is full of them.

245
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:18,411
Hey, you bet I do!

246
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,601
Would you do the honors, Tanaka?

247
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:21,801
Me?

248
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,941
I don't want to touch that filthy trash.

249
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,511
No joke, porn manga.

250
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,861
Isn't it?

251
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,551
What a disgrace.

252
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:39,491
They even have Nekodora porn!

253
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:40,421
What?

254
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,831
We're talking about a tightly packed
line of dozens of thousands of guys...

255
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,801
...like these who pour into a huge hall.

256
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,661
You talk as if you've been there.

257
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,371
Is everyone there to buy this stuff?

258
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:51,841
Yes!

259
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,741
No, not everyone is!

260
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:55,811
Kohsaka buys it too, naturally.

261
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:56,941
That I do!

262
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:02,681
Um, if you want titles geared
towards women, we have better ones.

263
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,511
Don't bring those up!

264
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:05,451
Show me!

265
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,061
Are you for real?

266
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,861
Isn't he... you know?

267
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:16,901
...and he's the vocalist from...

268
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,871
These don't belong to me personally...

269
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:19,701
Whoa!

270
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:24,611
You know, I think I really
am a little interested now.

271
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,981
Y-You suppose her eyes just opened?

272
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,031
I can't wait for Comic Fest!

273
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,061
Why've things turned
out like this, again?

274
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,611
Yeah, why's Sistah here?

275
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,781
You're one to talk!

276
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:48,891
Needless to say, I don't have one bit
of an inkling to become an otaku.

277
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:52,001
I'm only here to keep an eye on her.

278
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,801
Do you get that?

279
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:55,061
You do, right?

280
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,571
Of course we do.

281
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,501
How childish.

282
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:01,681
Someone has to teach kids
how rough the world is.

283
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:06,481
Well, we understand that
plenty, but we can't help you.

284
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,411
We'll have our hands full shopping.

285
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:09,041
Right.

286
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:12,791
I know, which is why I
won't let her slip away.

287
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,321
As if I'd slip away from Kohsaka.

288
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:17,821
Don't let it go to your head!

289
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,661
It's not?

290
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,891
She's not slipping away...

291
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,761
Yeah...

292
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:33,631
Hey...

293
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:34,671
Yeah?

294
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,771
Why are they lined up in the
middle of this goddamned heat?

295
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,041
How should I know?

296
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:47,751
Ahh, the ones up front are
finally starting to stand up...

297
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,921
Wonder if they'll move...

298
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,361
I'm about to have a nosebleed...

299
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,161
Oh, okay.

300
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,521
Gotcha.

301
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,701
They say they'll meet up
with us once we've moved some.

302
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,741
Man, their type sure is crafty.

303
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:09,781
Please keep off the grass.

304
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:10,641
Huh?

305
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,111
The lawn is all off-limits.
Please come over here at once.

306
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:35,831
Kohsaka!

307
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,131
Kohsaka!

308
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:38,711
Kohsaka?

309
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,571
H-How far are you gonna go?

310
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,511
The lines for the biggest
circles are outside.

311
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:09,861
Why do they do something like...

312
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,531
Don't you think becoming
an otaku ain't worth it?

313
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,651
No, I'll do it!

314
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,151
I've got what it takes, I know it!

315
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,881
Someone in our group said this...

316
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,721
An otaku isn't something
you try to become...

317
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,651
You just are one before you know it...

318
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,201
That's why you can't quit either.

319
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:51,581
It's laughable, but
for us it's a tragedy.

320
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,481
You don't really get what it
means to go out with an otaku.

321
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:01,721
It's not as if it's enough to
say you'll just become one too...

322
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,951
What're you saying?

323
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,191
In my opinion...

324
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,231
Nah, I won't tell you.

325
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:11,101
That's unfair!

326
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,931
You're my rival, idiot.

327
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,561
Like I'd tell you.

328
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:33,791
Did you see all those dojinshi
for sale on the way here?

329
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,981
It's an incredible world.

330
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,081
I totally didn't have time to...

331
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,661
Then let's go see.

332
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,731
I totally don't have the willpower...

333
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,931
You don't have a thing.

334
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:45,331
I totally don't...

335
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,131
Please don't sit on the grass.

336
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:51,601
Hi.

337
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,261
Oh? What happened to those two?

338
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:56,111
We got separated so I called them.

339
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:57,911
They said they'll be at the
restaurant down at that end...

340
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,881
...and for us to call
them when we leave.

341
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,851
Just tell them to go home already.

342
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,581
What the hell'd they come for anyway?

343
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:08,791
This is a letdown, since
Kasukabe comes here so rarely.

344
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:12,831
It's a mistake in itself for them
to come when they don't even fit in!

345
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,191
That's true.

346
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:16,631
But you know...

347
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:21,771
Now we can admire the booty
to our hearts' content.

348
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:24,001
How about the new Jam Jam Bullet?

349
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:26,161
Here it is, I bought it.

350
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,141
We sure bought a lot this time.

351
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:50,831
You mean you've never thought of
becoming an otaku for Kohsaka's sake?

352
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:52,061
Never.

353
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:56,901
Well, I did at least try a video
game with him once, but that bombed.

354
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,201
Then you have tried.

355
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,881
So, do you understand now?

356
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,841
What?

357
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:04,681
Give me a hint.

358
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:05,301
No.

359
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,641
Why not?

360
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:10,611
People sure get crabby
when they get old.

361
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:11,681
Ow!

362
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:30,241
It was just a typical Comic
Fest for us, in the end.

363
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:31,871
That it was.

364
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,971
But maybe we got to buy more this time?

365
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,911
Hey, Keiko.

366
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,011
Huh?

367
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,981
How long are you going
to be at my place?

368
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:42,651
Oh, I'll leave today.

369
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,911
Oh yeah?
Is that so...

370
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:48,851
You're a total gimp.
How long have we been related?

371
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:51,691
You bought a ton of dirty
stuff today, didn't you?

372
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,731
I could do without an
actual little sister...

373
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:58,771
You think?

374
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,361
There's nothing good about them.

375
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:04,061
So you do understand.

376
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:05,171
Understand what?

377
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,741
How to date an otaku.

378
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,431
That's it.

379
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:11,801
What, you mean like this?

380
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:12,451
Yup!

381
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,281
Then today, you too...

382
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,821
Yeah, I'll go back
to my place, of course.

383
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:23,491
Ouch, that's rough.

384
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:27,031
Well, it's about valuing
your time alone...

385
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:31,031
Yeah but, I mean, isn't
that like being cheated on?

386
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,101
It is...

387
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:36,261
You're something else, sistah.

388
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,241
Admiration doesn't make me happy.

389
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,101
In that case let me
stay at your place...

390
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,141
Go home!

391
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,781
What was that for?

392
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,441
<i>I guess they get along now?
What was that for?</i>

393
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,281
That can't be a good thing...

394
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:52,311
Hey, you don't suppose your sister
will get into our school next year?

395
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:54,981
No, she's an idiot.
We're in the clear.

396
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:55,921
Pardon?

397
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:15,841
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

398
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:25,181
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

399
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:34,451
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

400
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:44,201
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

401
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:54,581
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

402
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:06,061
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

403
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:15,531
<i>The time we spied from there sparkled,
even if nothing big happened.</i>

404
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:25,511
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

405
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:34,391
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

406
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,121
Saki, why do you hate otaku?

407
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,101
Because they're homely.

408
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:47,901
They're fat, they wear bandanas and
weird gloves, have bags full of junk...

409
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:49,601
Lately more of them
have been attractive.

410
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:52,841
I don't know, but you can tell them by
their stench, that super strong smell.

411
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,911
And they're so proud
when they take a bath.

412
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:57,071
Like that's some extraordinary thing.
It's nothing to be "proud" of.

413
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:57,911
Um, well...

414
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,111
And what's with their conversations?

415
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,151
Did you know this, did you know that?

416
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,621
That's not conversation, it's just a
bragging fest. What are they, idiots?

417
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,251
Keep your voices down,
stop talking to yourselves...

418
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:06,451
...don't get so friendly
with me, get lost!

419
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:07,391
Aww.

420
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:09,351
Don't say things like that!
