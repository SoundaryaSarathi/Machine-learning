Then we extract Hafzshv,</font></font>

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, this is not always related to Hafzsh</font></font>

I tried "Nsrsh" I check the time,</font></font>

That's why...</font></font>

100
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,530
I feel like a real man to accept this responsibility.</font></font>

101
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,280

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,770
So then we have to ask where it was earlier.</font></font>

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,540
Even if you find the culprits are sure to succeed,</font></font>

140
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,530
If you ignored the wants of Makn Harvkv Senpai, what are you doing?</font></font>

Of course I will fight,</font></font>

142
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,280
The Avlshm wanted to fight someone who is Kvrakvmv.</font></font>

143
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160

Maybe.</font></font>

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,540
Anything faster memory should move it back.</font></font>

151
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,430
Otherwise, here's condition worse.</font></font>

Oh, that is my Makn...</font></font>

00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Avyamasa for power.</font></font>

175
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,490
I do not care what will happen for me.</font></font>

176
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,240
Here you see is when we were training dojo.</font></font>

177
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,420
Here is when we see the amusement park,</font></font>

178
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,630
Here is when you see a scam tips.</font></font>

179
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
Broadly Aaron?</font></font>

180
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,920

181
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,870

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,750

183
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,520
Mygzrvndym time together since childhood always right?</font></font>

184
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,670
The fate of us put together.</font></font>

185
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,760
Well, you can call it let boyhood friends.</font></font>

186
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
Childhood friend?</font></font>

187
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,560
So you can not remember anything?</font></font>

188
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,070
So do not answer, Takrv.</font></font>

189
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,210
With the condition that Hafzsh missing,</font></font>

190
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,730
What does that come to mind.</font></font>

191
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,500
Zvky'll have to wait for others to make fun of all offenders got stuck.</font></font>

192
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,620
What if,</font></font>

193
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,760
The offender interlock Brngrdh bring his memory?</font></font>

194
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,310
It also has a professional hit.</font></font>

195
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,720
Allowing it to be true.</font></font>

196
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,820
Come to believe that...</font></font>

197
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,570
That certainly before crossbar.</font></font>

198
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,560
Amaya Harvkv.</font></font>

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,070
Seventeen-year-old.</font></font>

200
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,960
The second year, the Academy Tnby,</font></font>

201
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,720
Deputy Palestinian students.</font></font>

202
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,910
Or so it seems!</font></font>

203
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,670
Takrv ass!</font></font>

204
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,050
So you were here.</font></font>

205
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,730
Could not sleep.</font></font>

206
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,100
You're trying to remember something about you bring?</font></font>

207
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,310
No, I was thinking about you.</font></font>

208
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,680
From?</font></font>

209
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,820
A picture of all its Bchgymvn under contract, right?</font></font>

210
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,580
When I look at them I realized something.</font></font>

211
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,950
I looked up to as a kid.</font></font>

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,690
Even if Josh was Hafzm the head,</font></font>

213
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,570
I any longer the only relationship I knew, right?</font></font>

214
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,660
Nmyzashtym put together and did not behave like lovers together.</font></font>

215
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Uh huh.</font></font>

216
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,470
What was a coward.</font></font>

217
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,690
But after losing Hafzm was a good thing.</font></font>

218
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,650
What!?</font></font>

219
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,350
That's the second time I was in love with someone.</font></font>

220
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,610
Miriam.</font></font>

221
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,330
There was progress, huh?</font></font>

222
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,760
If I take so I knew I was a member of the group.</font></font>

223
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,050
Hạrwḵw?</font></font>

224
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,940
It's possible that...</font></font>

225
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,210
M - Mydvstm!</font></font>

226
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,840
E - Harvey - not!</font></font>

227
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,620
Good morning, Takrv ass!</font></font>

228
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,030
Good morning.</font></font>

229
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,020
Here - here, here - a kiss!?</font></font>

230
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,950
What!? No way!</font></font>

231
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,730
Miriam?</font></font>

232
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,480
What are you doing, Harvkv?</font></font>

233
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
I do not remember much larger rep am!</font></font>

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,450
I do not remember that you're older.</font></font>

235
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,200
Also, I have lost Hafzm.</font></font>

236
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,450
Nitrogen ask what the hell are you doing?</font></font>

237
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,160
I had already decided!</font></font>

238
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,210
Who decided?</font></font>

239
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,920
I do not want to be the number 2.</font></font>

240
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,830
I want my legal wife.</font></font>

241
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,070
Han!?</font></font>

242
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,300
Aum...</font></font>

243
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,570
If you get help Hafzm,</font></font>

244
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,710
You're a second year student, Aoyama are.</font></font>

245
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,370
I have lost Hafzm,</font></font>

246
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,240
That's why I came back the first year!</font></font>

247
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,000
Is that so?</font></font>

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,850
Such a decision impressive!</font></font>

249
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,210
Let's start after class, okay?</font></font>

250
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,960
What!?</font></font>

251
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,950
Well, go to page 48 of the book.</font></font>

252
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,560
That's right.</font></font>

253
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Eco-san, Byvkv Kun invited to his room...</font></font>

254
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,240
If you continue to get this... I'll...</font></font>

255
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,790
Die.</font></font>

256
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,740
No problem Zvky Senpai Nevermind'll find the culprits?</font></font>

257
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,070
I just got around that we want to look useless.</font></font>

258
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,480
He was convicted of theft and assault,</font></font>

259
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,670
Makn Harvkv stole the ball cock.</font></font>

260
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,800
What do you think then?</font></font>

261
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,470
Then what?</font></font>

262
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,260
What was that?</font></font>

263
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,140

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,470

268
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,830
SAMA Takrv Where?</font></font>

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,790

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,830

272
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,660
Miriam.</font></font>

273
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,500
The protection he got, right?</font></font>

274
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,040
Yeah.</font></font>

275
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,030
After we doing here?</font></font>

276
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,260
I'm sorry, Takrv ass.</font></font>

277
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,520
I lied.</font></font>

278
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,470
How much power.</font></font>

279
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,990
Really awesome.</font></font>

280
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,000
Until this Makn hold,</font></font>

No, up on us,</font></font>

283

00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,940
Wish I had a good fight,</font></font>

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,760
And as I think I have a real fight with Mvrakvmv.</font></font>
