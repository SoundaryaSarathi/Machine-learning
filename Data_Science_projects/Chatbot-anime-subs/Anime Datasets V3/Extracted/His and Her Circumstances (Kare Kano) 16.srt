1
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey Yukino.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,594
We're about to leave...

3
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:25,032
Wh..What is it?

4
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:27,204
I love you.

5
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,441
Today we're going to visit grandpa.

6
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,779
But it's really only a short train ride away.

7
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,382
Actually...

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,085
Yukino's really taken after mom.

9
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:44,183
Sometimes it feels like
I'm seeing mom in her youth.

10
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,658
You knew each other
since you were kids, right?

11
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:48,694
Yeah...

12
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,999
We used to play together all the time...

13
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:55,928
Your father always played the
stupidest, most dangerous games.

15
00:00:56,873 --> 00:01:00,199
He kept making me go along
and I had a terrible time.

17
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:01,867
Huh!

18
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,176
I'm feeling sick just thinking about it...

19
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,649
I was a bit mischievous as a kid.

20
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,045
Huh!

21
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,984
He hasn't grown up at all.

22
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,020
My feelings turned into love

23
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,513
when mom was in tenth grade.

24
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,415
Exactly the age Yukino is now!

25
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:21,000
So lately, when I look at Yukino...

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
I get this funny feeling inside...

28
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:30,930
The next stop is...

29
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,137
Hi Grandpa!

30
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:37,675
Oh, there you are!

31
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,141
I'm glad you came. Come in, come in.

32
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,119
Hey there. Why the hell
did you close the door?!

33
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,217
Shut the hell up! We don't need you!
Go home!

35
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,687
Mom and dad decided to get
married when they were young.

36
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,220
So dad got beat up by grandpa,

37
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,121
and they're still on bad terms to this day.

38
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,089
Hmph!

39
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,291
Oh!

40
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:00,329
Not again...

41
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:04,569
Why, the three of you have gotten even
more beautiful since I last saw you...

43
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,037
Just like the three dolls for the Girls' Festival.

44
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:08,402
HeeHee...

45
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:13,314
You've grown so well even under
the care of such a failure...

48
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,150
Such gallant effort!

49
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,577
It brings tears to my eyes.

50
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,412
The old geezer's as obnoxious as ever.

51
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:21,987
He keeps on grumbling just

52
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,255
because I took his daughter away.

53
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:26,694
You just don't know when to give up.
Let go of your daughter already!

55
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:28,263
You too, Dad.

56
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:30,925
You minimum-wage wimp...

57
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,129
Oh!

58
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,536
Don't bring my salary into this!!

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,004
Shut up, you brat!

60
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:47,274
You could never understand how it
feels to have married my precious
daughter off to a (bleep) like you!
64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,781
I'm so tired of it. A man's worth isn't (bleep),
it's love! The love overflowing from his heart!

66
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,623
Love! Heh heh!

67
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,219
Love! Here! I'll make it into calligraphy!!

68
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,000
Goddammit!

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,728
Are you frustrated that you can't
do anything, my little Hero of Love?

70
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,229
I dare you to defeat this old geezer!

71
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:10,037
Dammit! I'll bring him down!

72
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,896
I'll make that old coot shut up once and for all!

73
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:12,935
Look look,

74
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,042
these are old pictures of me.

75
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,973
Wow, you look just like Sis.

76
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,275
Come to think of it, we really are alike.

77
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,115
Even I coudn't tell us apart.

78
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:25,881
See, isn't your mother cute?

79
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,888
And she's still cute now.

80
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,621
Yukino-chan really does
look exactly like Miyako.

81
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,458
Just make sure you don't get
taken advantage of by some jerk.

82
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:35,664
I do have someone I'm going out with.

83
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:36,723
What!?

84
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,258
This is him.

85
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,201
He seems quite pleasant.

86
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:43,437
What's with the different treatment?!

87
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,868
I'm going shopping for dinner, okay?

88
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:48,634
Then I'll go too.

89
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,206
That's right.

90
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,837
Go carry my daughter's things.

91
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,575
Just like her servant.

92
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,981
Would you knock it off!

93
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,011
Check!

94
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,284
This neighborhood sure has changed.

95
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,723
They've put up condos and everything.

96
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,731
It really takes you back, doesn't it?

97
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,637
Yeah, shall we hold hands?

98
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,342
Dusk...The expanse of the city lights...

99
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:26,074
The aroma of dinner,
wafting in from somewhere.

100
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,778
It feels lonely at this time of day.

101
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,315
Yet strangely, it feels pleasant.

102
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,500
At times like this, I remember my childhood.

103
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,054
My departed grandfather,
the trees I used to climb,

104
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:40,287
my friends...

105
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,695
I remember those distant days
I can no longer touch.

107
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:54,976
Oh, there he is!

108
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,045
Hey, Hiro-chan!

109
00:04:59,148 --> 00:04:59,842
Yo!

110
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,752
Father, Age 6,
Full name: Miyazawa Hiroyuki.

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,312
Also known as the "Little Devil".

112
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:13,354
He did nothing but stupid things.

114
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,354
Breaking things,

115
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,230
fighting with elementary
schoolers and winning,

116
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,797
stealing a St. Bernard and riding on its back,
*He does not mean any harm*

117
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:22,795
sumo wrestling with cats, and so forth.

119
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:27,106
His nickname of "Little Devil" was
well known all over the neighborhood.

120
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,876
He was a being even adults feared,

121
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,872
saying "keep your valuables away from him."

122
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,376
His encounter with his wife, as well...

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,457
You girls wanna be let in our group?

124
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,689
Yeah yeah
Great, I got a perfect job for ya.

125
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,566
You get to be...HOSTAGES!

126
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,504
His encounter with his

127
00:05:58,207 --> 00:05:59,936
wife was also rather stupid.

128
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,871
All right already, I'll untie you.

129
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,470
We gotta go pee!

130
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:05,609
What?!

131
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:10,300
Since then, he was genuinely
trying to entertain her.

133
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:14,455
He did things to the girls thinking he was amusing
them, but they didn't take it that way at all.

136
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:16,483
Ready?

137
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:18,356
Not yet!

138
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,190
Ready?

139
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,187
Not yet!

140
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:23,855
Ready?

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,962
Okay!

142
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,635
Oh, Hiro-chan!

143
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,234
Hey, did you find him?

144
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,673
No.

145
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:34,975
Where IS Hiro-chan?

146
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,111
Where'd he go?

147
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,343
Maybe he's over that way...

148
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:39,876
Go to find him.

149
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,083
Hiro-chan

150
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,078
Hey

151
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:47,889
Hiro-chan, 

152
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,382
is it true you don't have a father and mother?

153
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:51,824
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:52,819
Oh!

155
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:53,984
Huh?

156
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:57,696
I don't have a mother either.

157
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:01,760
We match!

158
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,000
Match?

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,100
Later!
Bye!

160
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,078
Grandpa, I'm home!

161
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:17,248
How was your day, Hiroyuki?

162
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,216
I lived alone with grandpa back then.

163
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,592
With the small amount of
money my parents had left

164
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:26,653
and the savings grandpa had,
we were barely scraping by.

165
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,520
But I never felt lonely,

166
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,395
because it's always been the two of us ever

167
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,600
since I could remember, and I loved grandpa.

168
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,177
Now, it's about time for you to get off my lap. 

169
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,036
My legs hurt.

170
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,248
Out there you're the boss of the gang, 

171
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:48,743
but here at home you're such a

172
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:49,982
baby it's embarassing.

173
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,019
It's okay.

174
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:59,720
But at some point I stopped
clinging to grandpa's lap.

176
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,193
We didn't sleep together
in his futon anymore.

177
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,266
Because I started to think that

178
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,759
I can't demand the attention anymore.

179
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:11,665
Oh, 

180
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,570
It's Hiro-chan!

181
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:22,142
He's wearing a school uniform!

182
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:23,944
He's in junior high!

183
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,080
Do I look cool?

184
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:30,281
You look funny!

185
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,353
Ha!
I'm not going to hang out with

187
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,527
knapsack pipsqueeks like you guys anymore.

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,797
But Hiro-chan, you're
certainly taking your time.

190
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:43,762
The girl next door leaves
much earlier every day for school.

192
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,499
Oh SHIT!

193
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:49,834
I left home at the same time
I always did for grade school!

195
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:51,705
Hiro-chan...

196
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,309
I..I..I am so damn late!

197
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,043
Later, you two. 

198
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,283
Try to manage without me!

199
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:05,554
After that, he and his wife  went to different
schools and hardly ever saw each other.

203
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,157
Well, let's go.

204
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,694
Huh!

205
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,394
Hiro, how can you be so relaxed?

206
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,903
Today's the day the new students arrive!

207
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,603
We gotta go check out
if there are any cute girls!

208
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,236
We had bad luck of the draw

209
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,612
of girls in our class this year,

210
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,479
so the newbies are our last hope!

211
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,716
Bastards! You're so dead!!

212
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,083
Whatever. I'll pass.

214
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,488
What?
You're no fun.

215
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:36,356
You're not interested in girls at all.

216
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,549
You're pretty popular with the girls, too.

217
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:40,192
Aren't you gonna go out with anyone?

218
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,060
I don't get that stuff at all!

219
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:52,468
We will now begin the
22nd Matriculation Ceremony.

220
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:57,110
We will now begin the
22nd Matriculation Ceremony.

221
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:01,238
We will now begin the
22nd Matriculation Ceremony.

222
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,116
Wah!

223
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,183
Owww!

224
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,921
Uh-oh, that was a girl. Are you o...k...?

225
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,172
Hey, Hiro-chan!

226
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,098
Hey,

227
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:32,577
He was thinking of a girl as
cute for the first time.

229
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,512
Grandpa is thiner than before.

230
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,846
I'm home, grandpa.

231
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:46,258
Ah! Be careful!

233
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:53,767
Hiro-chan!

234
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:57,664
I should call you...
Senpai, good morning.

236
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,665
Huh?

237
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,040
Huh! You are so cute!

238
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,468
Oh no!

239
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,346
Oh, I like the sound of that.

240
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:06,738
Don't forget to respect your senpai.

241
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,010
Wet gwo oth mwe!

242
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:11,914
See ya.

243
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,369
Hey Miyako, is the guy you like...

244
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,875
Miyazawa-san in 9th grade?

245
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:38,904
What?

246
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,043
E..Err... I...

247
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:49,248
u..um....

248
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:50,953
Wah!

249
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:15,272
Oh, Hiro-chan.

250
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,447
I was surprised you got into Kawakita High.

251
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,046
It looked like you were always goofing off, 

252
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:20,647
but I guess you had been doing your work.

253
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:22,852
Huh!

254
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,121
I'm a pretty smart guy.

255
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:29,625
U..um....
I wonder if you can get into my high school?

257
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,030
Piece of cake, with the grades I have!

258
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,773
Okay. Then, if there isn't
somewhere else you'd rather go, 

259
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,145
come to my high school.

260
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,371
Okay. I promise!

261
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:04,294
U.um..
It's almost time for the freshmen to arrive.

264
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,561
What? You're not on the staff
for the Matriculation Ceremony.

265
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,794
You going to look for some hot little chick?

266
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,633
Or is there someone you like?

267
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:12,866
Are you waiting for her?

268
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:14,306
Morons.

269
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:15,371
Hi!

270
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,077
You're pretty early.

271
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,485
Hiro-chan, now that you're a senior,

272
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,780
you're not going to college?

273
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,492
Oh, we don't have any money.

274
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,452
What, with a big house like that?

275
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:36,696
It's only the outside that's big.

276
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,491
And it's just grandpa and me.

277
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,265
Besides, 

278
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,738
I can finally earn money on my own.

279
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,471
The next stop is...

280
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:50,839
I'm home, grandpa.

281
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:55,847
How was your day, Hiroyuki?

282
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,622
At some point grandpa began

283
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,319
to clearly show his age.

284
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,922
There's something painful
about living with the elderly.

285
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:11,500
It was painful to watch grandpa just
getting nicer with the passing years.

286
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,795
At some point I really began
to want to grow up quickly.

288
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,139
I didn't want to be a kid
who was just protected,

289
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,500
but an adult who could
support grandpa by myself.

291
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,110
I want to let him relax
and take it easy.

293
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,677
I want him to eat good
food and have a good time.

294
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,611
I want to somehow return all the love

295
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:34,315
he's given me all these years.

296
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,715
When I become an adult, it'll all come true.

297
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,066
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

298
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,273
It isn't something to make that much fuss over.

300
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,334
I'll be fine, so you be off to school.

301
00:14:58,947 --> 00:14:59,504
Okay.

302
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,913
Hiro-chan graduates soon!
How you've grown.

304
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:14,456
I thought you were a little kid
until just a while ago...

307
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,826
but now you're a fine young man.

308
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,729
How strange that

309
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,435
I never noticed until now.

310
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:30,843
Oh, Hiro-chan!

311
00:15:55,203 --> 00:16:02,200
Grandpa, I fixed some food.

312
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:06,069
Grandpa?

313
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:33,466
Hiro-chan, everyone who came for

314
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,007
the funeral has left.

315
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,339
You must be worn out.

316
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:39,343
Do you want anything to eat?

317
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,572
No, I'm fine. Thanks for all your help.

318
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:44,580
I'll be okay by myself,

319
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,345
so you go on home.

320
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,390
But Hiro-chan, you
haven't eaten anything at all!

321
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,391
That isn't good for you.

322
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,359
Thanks, 

323
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:54,921
but I'll really be okay.

324
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,925
Go on home.

325
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:48,647
What are you doing? What are you...

326
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:53,454
Because...! I wanted to be with you.

327
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,862
You idiot...

328
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,728
Why didn't I make it in time?

329
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,732
I couldn't do anything even
though I loved him so much.

331
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,270
I'd always been afraid that

332
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:20,639
I'd have to say goodbye
to grandpa some day.

333
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,084
So I wanted to have done something
to show for myself first.

335
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,454
It hurts...
I couldn't show anything.

336
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:34,752
I wanted to do for him in my mind...

337
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:39,857
There are only the things
And now I can't do a goddamn thing!

340
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,870
But Hiro-chan,

341
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,904
your grandfather may not
have seen things that way.

344
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,843
I'm sure his love for
you was bigger than that.

345
00:18:57,843 --> 00:19:00,312
So much that he was fully satisfied just

346
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,715
by your being born into this world.

347
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,989
I'm sure that love goes that deep.

348
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:13,430
I wonder if I couldn't take his place.

350
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,031
After that...

351
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,831
...we waited for Miyako to
graduate from high school...

352
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,031
...and were then married right away.

353
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,244
Starting the year after,

354
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,239
we were blessed with lovely
girls for three years in a row.

355
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,548
Our life was tough, but happy.

356
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,652
Now I understand grandpa's feelings.

357
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,621
Just being born is enough.

358
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,954
That alone makes me happy.

359
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,097
Grandpa's love now flows within me, 

360
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,396
and will be passed on to my children.

361
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,234
Because love is something that goes around.

362
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,001
They built a nice library

363
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:56,469
where your house used to be.

364
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:59,750
I had no choice.

365
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:01,944
I couldn't keep up that house by myself.

366
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,883
Dinnertime!

367
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,916
Dad, you're getting old, 

368
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,987
so don't be stubborn and come live with us.

369
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:15,790
Yeah.

370
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,765
No way. It's all over when you have to get

371
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,126
taken care of by your kids.

372
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:22,464
I want to have my freedom.

373
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,250
Come on.

374
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,434
I'll change your diapers any time!

375
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,872
Shut up, you punk!

376
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,539
Dad!

377
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:33,437
I swear...

378
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:34,374
how long are you going

379
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,110
to keep being stubborn like this?

380
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,076
Enough already.
What do you take me for?

381
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,748
Dad, you spewed rice.

383
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:44,090
Oh, leave me alone.

384
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,053
Because love is something that goes around.

385
00:22:11,073 --> 00:22:12,131
What'll happen next!

386
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:13,608
The summer vacation is both long and short.

387
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,599
Sis waits and waits but her
boyfriend hasn't come back yet.

388
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,341
She spends her days chatting
with friends and studying,

389
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:19,179
but the emptiness in her
heart does not get fullfilled.

390
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:21,981
And then, the long-awaited
Arima Souichirou returns!

391
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:24,080
But, however!

392
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:25,715
Next time on KareKano,
"Thoughts of Him"
