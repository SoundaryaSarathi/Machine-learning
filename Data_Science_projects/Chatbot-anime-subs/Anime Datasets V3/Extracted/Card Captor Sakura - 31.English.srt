1
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:06,626
Morning!

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,092
You’re so noisy in the morning.

3
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,363
I’m not noisy.

4
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,868
A monster will shakes the whole
house by just walking around.

5
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,505
I’m not a monster!

6
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,301
Have you gained weight recently?

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,577
It’s fall, the season
for monsters to gain weight.

8
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,307
I haven’t gained weight!

9
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,455
It looks like you haven’t
gotten any taller, at least.

10
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:36,186
This sucks!

11
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:40,994
One day, I’ll grow big, and for sure…

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,095
I’ll squish him for sure!

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,000
[Sakura and the Book wih No Name]

14
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,444
Naoko!

15
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:27,776
Sakura.

16
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,536
It’s lunchtime, right?

17
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:30,779
Come eat with us.

18
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:31,749
Yes.

19
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,449
What were you reading?

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,853
I borrowed it from the library.

21
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:37,584
Is it a scary book?

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,154
No, it’s a fantasy novel.

23
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:41,760
Fantasy?

24
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,495
Do you like reading fantasy novels?

25
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,364
It looks interesting.

26
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:50,600
What kind of story is it?

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,706
There’s a dragon, and there’s
a turtle bigger than a mountain!

28
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,634
There’s a story like that from China,
you know.

29
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:58,871
Mei-ling…

30
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,240
It’s like the one about the
old man who saved his village…

31
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:04,114
…from a day long siege by 100 horsemen.

32
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,041
Hey, you know where Shao-Lang is?

33
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:09,818
He’s supposed to eat lunch with me,

34
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:10,780
but he isn’t around.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,118
If you’re looking for Li,
he was heading towards the roof.

36
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,653
Oh, okay. Thanks!

37
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:39,947
Shao-Lang!

38
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:40,841
Mei-ling!

39
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,516
Why’d you disappear even though

40
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:44,980
you knew I made lunch for you?!

41
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:46,080
That’s…

42
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,722
Meanie, meanie, meanie, meanie, meanie!

43
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,955
It’s because I felt an aura!

44
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:53,558
By “aura,” do you mean…

45
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:56,758
A Clow Card.

46
00:02:58,437 --> 00:02:59,369
Hey, is that any good?

47
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,072
How nice…

48
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,207
A used book store.

49
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,238
Hey, can we go check it out
for a few minutes?

50
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,010
Sure.

51
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,351
Naoko sure is a book lover.

52
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,553
Just a while ago she was praised

53
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,386
by Miss Midori for her reading.

54
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:22,421
That’s right.

55
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,666
Is there something wrong?

56
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,359
The aura of a Clow Card.

57
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,103
Where is it coming from?

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,410
From there I think.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,147
Do you need to go find it?

60
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:44,779
Yeah…

61
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,549
Sakura, Tomoyo, what’s wrong?

62
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,211
Oh, nothing. We’ll be right there.

63
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,483
Is it alright about the card…?

64
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:57,823
There are too many people, anyway. We’ll
come back later tonight and find it.

65
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,123
As the Card Captor, right?

66
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,529
I made a new costume for you!

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,334
T… Tomoyo…

68
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,145
Huh?

69
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:22,779
There’s no name on the spine.

70
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:37,727
Huh?

71
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:48,242
Please write the next
chapter of this story.

72
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,884
Sounds interesting.
I’ll get this!

73
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,932
It’s so cute!

74
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,667
I’m so happy…

75
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,132
Your happiness comes pretty easy.

76
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,234
Being with someone you love…

77
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,440
…and being able to take a video of her

78
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,543
wearing cute clothes!

79
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,275
I couldn’t ask for a better situation!

80
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,144
You’ll get a shot of
the super-cool me, too, right?

81
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,485
Are you playing around?

82
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,486
Huh?

83
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,936
You getting in our way again,
brat and little wench?

84
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:49,496
You’re getting in our way.

85
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,369
You’re too late, anyway.

86
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,208
Shao-Lang noticed the aura of a Clow Card

87
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:55,880
around lunchtime.

88
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:58,515
Sakura had noticed by then, too!

89
00:05:59,218 --> 00:05:59,775
Right?

90
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,410
Yeah, but it was when
I was coming home from school…

91
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,983
Yay! Shao-Lang was first!

92
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:07,952
No way!

93
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,924
Sakura is gonna tell us

94
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,490
where the card is now!

95
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:15,329
Shao-Lang already knows!

96
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:17,229
Right, Sakura?

97
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:18,931
Right, Shao-Lang?

98
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,301
Yes.

99
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:21,228
Where is it?

100
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,005
Over there…

101
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,584
Just a cat…

102
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,919
I… it ain’t a normal cat…

103
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,036
What?

104
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:05,841
Fly!

105
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,808
Tomoyo!

106
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,153
Mei-ling!

107
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,420
I don’t taste good!

108
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:21,888
Let Mei-ling go!

109
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,034
Li!

110
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,748
What’s with this guy?

111
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,383
Eh?

112
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,153
It appears that it likes Li.

113
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,747
Might be the Big card.

114
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:46,752
“Big”?

115
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,786
“Big,” means enlarge?

116
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:52,062
Big can enlarge objects.

117
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,296
So where’s the card at?

118
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:01,730
Over there!

119
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,100
The card!

120
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,438
Hey, let me go!

121
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,816
Hey, quit interfering with Shao-Lang!
Get off of him!

122
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:22,824
There it is! Sakura,
that’s the Big card!

123
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,604
Sakura, seal it!

124
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:41,206
Eh?

125
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,605
It’s just a big fish!

126
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,743
Show me some Card Captor courage!

127
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:00,590
Return to thy true form,
Clow Card!

128
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:13,271
All right!

129
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:18,079
You did it!

130
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,276
Here you go.

131
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,426
Oh, geez.

132
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,066
It’s your fault we didn’t get that card.

133
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,797
Are you listening?

134
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,290
That was good.

135
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:13,703
This book leaves room for a sequel.

136
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,269
Oh, that’s right.

137
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,602
[Please write the next
chapter of this story.]
“Next chapter,” huh?

138
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:36,558
That’s right…

139
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:43,195
That card was going
to be Shao-Lang’s!

140
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,426
But what actually happened was…

141
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:47,703
That was just luck!

142
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,965
Now, now, you two…

143
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,707
If that big cat hadn’t
gotten in our way,

144
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,743
the card would be Shao-Lang’s!

145
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:57,076
If Sakura hadn’t sealed that card,

146
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,347
you might’ve been
eaten by that cat!

147
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,011
What was that?!

148
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,181
You little wench!

149
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,583
Um…

150
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:13,995
What’s wrong, Sakura?

151
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,596
Gh… h… h… g…gh…

152
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:18,767
A ghost?

153
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:19,862
Yes.

154
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:20,932
Ghost?

155
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:26,507
There’s nothing there.

156
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:27,478
Shuu.

157
00:11:52,938 --> 00:12:00,743
“And so, the princess
didn’t know where she was.”

158
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,683
What’s after that…?

159
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:10,513
That’s it!

160
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,489
I saw it! I saw it!

161
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,395
Did you see it too,
Mei-ling?

162
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:21,991
Yeah…

163
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:23,823
Then it’s not a ghost.

164
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:25,559
Why?

165
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,696
Because you don’t have
that kind of perception.

166
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:31,299
Tomoyo, did you see it, too?

167
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:32,309
Yes.

168
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,372
Tomoyo doesn’t have
magic powers either.

169
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,307
Which means…

170
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:38,680
It’s not a ghost?

171
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,208
Exactly!

172
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,615
What a relief!

173
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,047
Eh?

174
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:49,916
W… what’s that?

175
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:50,726
A panther!

176
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,957
Did it escape from the zoo?

177
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:00,329
What’s that?

178
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,466
It’s got graffiti-like eyes!

179
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,711
Do Japanese panthers have wings?

180
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,412
I don’t think you’ll find that in a zoo.

181
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,452
There sure are a lot of weird things

182
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,516
wandering around in Japan.

183
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:23,986
That’s not really…

184
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,086
This could be…

185
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:32,234
“The panther, hippo
and the others grew wings…”

186
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:36,902
“… and they enjoyed
the experience of flying.”

187
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,310
“But that’s not all.”

188
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:49,178
“Other animals

189
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,450
and fish grew wings, too.”

190
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,061
Are these all the work
of a Clow Card?

191
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,366
The only one that could
do this is the Create card.

192
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,237
Create is the one

193
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,401
where if you write it,
it will become reality?

194
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,772
Right. It’s gotta be nearby.

195
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,739
But we didn’t feel it at all.

196
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:18,343
Yeah, there was only
the Big card’s aura.

197
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,818
Then again, with all this,
someone must be using Create

198
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,321
To make all these things appear.

199
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,149
I wonder if it’s okay to undo all this.

200
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,789
Anyway, it’s a pretty forgiving card,

201
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,064
so I think it’ll be…

202
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,469
Now what?

203
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,234
“And then, finally…”

204
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,711
“… growing wings…”

205
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:57,621
“… the very, very big King appeared.”

206
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,765
A… a monster!

207
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,051
This is bad.

208
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:32,487
What should we do?

209
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,419
We can only hope the person
using Create will stop soon.

210
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:37,557
Oh, no!

211
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,097
It’s heading towards the city.

212
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,902
At this rate,
it’ll crush a bunch of houses!

213
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:58,138
Lightning, come forth!

214
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:01,916
Why won’t it stop?

215
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:03,621
It’s too big.

216
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,987
What? Big? That’s it!
There’s a way!

217
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:09,750
What?

218
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,626
No! Definitely no!

219
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,368
There’s no other way!

220
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,704
I don’t wanna!

221
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,840
At this rate it’s gonna
wreck the city of Tomoeda!

222
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,046
But…

223
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,783
You mustn’t forget your responsibility
as the Card Captor!

224
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:40,490
I’m asking you, too, Sakura…

225
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,888
Tomoyo…

226
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,458
Okay. I’ll try it.

227
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:51,764
That’s great!

228
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,735
This will make a fantastic video!

229
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,909
Give me the size to meet this challenge!

230
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:09,412
Big!

231
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,195
All right!

232
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,397
That’s fantastic!

233
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,332
This is so embarrassing!

234
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:36,444
What’re you talking about, Sakura?!
Go and beat that monster!

235
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:43,212
Hey, you monster!

236
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,464
That’s it, that’s it!

237
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,367
I saw something like this on TV!

238
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:00,201
The hero stopping the disaster…

239
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,605
I never thought I’d see it for real!

240
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,499
Stay away from me!

241
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,211
Hit it with some kind of beam!

242
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,685
Fight with it

243
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,951
Can she really do it?

244
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,017
I don’t know if Sakura has any way

245
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,616
to beat a monster like that.

246
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:01,990
Sakura!

247
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,169
Sakura!

248
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:17,872
Eh?

249
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,216
Time to go to bed.

250
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,367
All right!
Whoever’s using Create has stopped!

251
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:40,666
Eh!

252
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,528
Sakura,

253
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,873
seal it before
it disappears completely!

254
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:44,998
Yes.

255
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:51,472
Return to thy true form…
Clow Card!

256
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:11,724
Good job, Sakura!

257
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,669
I didn’t know what would happen!

258
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,036
You’re still looking kinda big.

259
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,977
This is so embarrassing!

260
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,335
The book is… gone…

261
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,608
This is a big mystery!

262
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,769
Good morning!

263
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,612
Your bumping around
is noisy again today.

264
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,106
I’m not noisy.

265
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,183
A monster will shake the whole
house by just walking around.

266
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:09,719
What? No counterattack?

267
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:11,690
I can step on you anytime.

268
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:12,528
Eh?

269
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:17,224
Big!
