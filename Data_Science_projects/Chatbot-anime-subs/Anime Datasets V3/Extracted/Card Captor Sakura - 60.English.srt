1
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:20,180
What a hard painting

2
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:26,012
I should have picked
an easier one to paint…

3
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:35,996
Eriol-kun.

4
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,700
Sakura-san

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,503
Can I look?

6
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,467
Sure.

7
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:48,002
Great! Eriol-kun, you can really draw!

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,920
Thank you very much

9
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,499
I… I… I…

10
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,627
Y… yes…

11
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:15,327
li… like…

12
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,096
Sakura!

13
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,115
What’s wrong?

14
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:31,977
Someone is looking.

15
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,390
Who’s looking at you?

16
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,094
The person is looking at you, Sakura-san.

17
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,791
Me?

18
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,460
He is troubled too.

19
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:59,611
What a pity, last night.

20
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:01,347
What do you mean?

21
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:07,254
Just when you were 
going to confess to Sakura,
Kero-chan suddenly appeared.

22
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:11,057
When do you plan to tell her next?

23
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,360
I won’t tell her for the moment.

24
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:19,856
Last night I was only thinking that
I have to tell her.

25
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:26,700
But before that, there is something
I must do first.

26
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:33,379
[Sakura and her Precious Friends]

27
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:36,808
I’ve made a promise.

28
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:39,881
Before I knew who the person I like was,

29
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,585
Mei Lin will still be my fiancee
So…

30
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:47,590
You want to tell
Mei Lin-chan how you feel?

31
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,664
I called her last night,

32
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,264
I said there were things
that we have to talk about.

33
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,069
What did Mei Lin-chan say?

34
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,734
She told me not to
tell her on the phone.

35
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,399
I told her I want to tell her in person

36
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,266
and she said she understood.

37
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,771
Really?

38
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:08,240
I really want to talk to Mei Lin.
And after that…

39
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,045
I’ll tell Sakura what I feel.

40
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,320
When will you see Mei Lin-chan again?

41
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:19,023
I’m going back to Hong Kong during
winter vacation…

42
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,154
I can’t wait that long!

43
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:22,587
Mei Lin-chan!

44
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,338
When you called her

45
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,232
she immediately came.

46
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,677
Mei Lin can’t wait until Christmas.

47
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,695
Mei Lin-chan!

48
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,028
It’s been a long time
since I’ve seen you!

49
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,456
How come you’re here?

50
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,083
I came to sort things out.

51
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:54,821
Right, Shao Lan?

52
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,962
How long are you staying here?

53
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,204
I still have to go to school so
I’m leaving tomorrow.

54
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,040
Tomorrow?

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,734
Your leaving so soon?

56
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,403
So today!

57
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:18,344
Today after school
we can go together and play.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,852
But,

59
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:25,694
you came to sort things out…

60
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,365
You’re still the same,

61
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,121
Kinomoto-san!

62
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:35,663
So after school
in at the front of the school.

63
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,966
That’s too bad,

64
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:41,102
I have ice skating after school.

65
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:45,209
– I have piano… 
– Me too…

66
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,046
You have to have fun

67
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,782
with Mei Lin-chan for us then.

68
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,847
So, I’m going to go say hi
to the Terada sensei.

69
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:56,387
See you later!

70
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,890
Shao Lan! I’ll be right back

71
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,643
Who is it? I’m playing video games!

72
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,249
Why don’t you call another time?

73
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,822
Kero-chan, you’re playing
video games again?

74
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,849
Oh, it’s Sakura!

75
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,252
Call me later after
I play this game.

76
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,825
Today I saw Mei Lin-chan.

77
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,960
So I’m going to come home late

78
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,925
so if I open the door don’t worry

79
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:43,359
That girl is back?

80
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,907
But she said that
she is leaving tomorrow.

81
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:49,239
So today I want to talk with her.

82
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:51,606
Tell that girl,

83
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,842
even though the way

84
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,480
that I look isn’t very scary,
I can get her

85
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,683
to see how cool
I am in my original form next time.

86
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,218
Cooker… remember
to press the button.

87
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:21,732
Sorry that

88
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,670
I overheard you talking on the phone.

89
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,371
No, nothing private.

90
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,874
A new girl came in our class that
I’ve never seen before.

91
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,452
– With long hair…
– Her name is Li Mei Lin-chan,

92
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,549
she is an old student

93
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,053
After the school year
she went back to Hong Kong.

94
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:43,752
She sat where

95
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,225
you sit right now

96
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,996
She is Shao Lan-kun’s cousin.

97
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:48,897
So it’s like that!

98
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,631
We said that today after class
we will meet each other and play.

99
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,469
Be careful.

100
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,373
When it becomes dark, it is dangerous.

101
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,538
Thank you!

102
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,129
Why do you keep on smiling at me?

103
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,692
Because I get to see you,
that makes me very happy.

104
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,493
– Just because of that small thing?
– It’s not a small thing.

105
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:27,766
Being able to see you, I’m very happy!

106
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:32,210
Really?

107
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,738
When I saw you I was also very happy.

108
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:35,907
By the way,

109
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,180
Your the new Clow cards master?

110
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,980
Yes.

111
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,882
But there is still some problems right?

112
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:47,292
Yeah.

113
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,256
Are you ok? You look like a dummy…

114
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:54,065
– What dummy?
– Dummy looks is a dummy.

115
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,069
No need to say it, you already know.

116
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:59,671
But it’s no big deal.

117
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:03,075
You can stop looking like a dummy…

118
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:04,469
Today?

119
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,274
Are you going to tell
Mei Lin-chan today?

120
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:09,375
Tonight I’ll tell her how I feel.

121
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:10,973
If I didn’t tell her,

122
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:13,080
I’d break the promise.

123
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,833
I want to keep my promise with Mei Lin
no matter what.

124
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,288
Since you are that kind of person,

125
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:24,160
Mei Lin-chan likes you.

126
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:35,170
It opened again,
the store that sells juice.

127
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:38,244
That place’s drinks
taste really really good!

128
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,670
Really?

129
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,076
Why don’t we talk there?

130
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,605
OK.

131
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:48,213
What’s wrong?

132
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,324
Its Clow-san’s presence!

133
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:00,524
I feel the aura of strong magic.

134
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,314
What?

135
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:23,923
What is that???

136
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,136
Tomoyo-chan, Shao Lan-kun.

137
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,542
Are these the kind of
problems you just said?

138
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,256
Watch out!

139
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:08,462
King of thunder descend!!

140
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,103
– Are you ok?
– Yes.

141
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,777
King of thunder, descend!

142
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,216
Shit!

143
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:38,696
Mei Lin! Sakura!

144
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,011
It hurts!

145
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,618
– Are you OK?
– Thank you.

146
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:19,865
I can’t fight something that big!

147
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,072
There’s still so many!

148
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,878
How are we going to beat this?

149
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,282
Damn

150
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:35,209
if we want to beat them then…

151
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,220
If we use Wood,
it won’t affect them.

152
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:43,541
If I use Time, I will lose my power and
then I won’t be able to fight them.

153
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,194
The weather is so cold
how can I think?

154
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,125
Use that card!

155
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,538
Which card?

156
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,903
The one where you caught
at the skating rink.

157
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,705
When everybody was frozen!

158
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,044
Freeze!

159
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,045
O Key which hides the forces of darkness,

160
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,645
reveal thy true form before me.

161
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,821
I, Sakura, command thee under contract

162
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,654
Release!

163
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:17,996
O Card created by Clow,

164
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:20,395
discard thine old form and be reborn.

165
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,266
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

166
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,003
Freeze!

167
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:55,900
It’s coming again!
King of Thunder, descend!

168
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:06,242
It worked!

169
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:09,344
This is because of
Mei Lin-chan’s idea!

170
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,179
Mei Lin, Sakura,

171
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:12,348
are you ok?

172
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:16,846
I’m fine, because
Mei Lin-chan helped me.

173
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,452
– Tomoyo-chan, are you ok?
– Yes.

174
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,395
Right! Mei Lin-chan are you ok?

175
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,494
Mei Lin-chan, are your hands ok

176
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,030
No problem, no problem, I’m very good.

177
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:33,733
I’m so glad!

178
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,919
Today it was because of that girl

179
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,720
from Hong Kong that helped.

180
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,941
There’s people coming.

181
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,830
Lets go drink some juice.

182
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:38,504
Yup.

183
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,805
But how come when it
happened nobody came by?

184
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,367
It is a place to jog.

185
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:45,845
Probably there is

186
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,578
something that scares away people.

187
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:49,606
Thinking about it,

188
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,017
before there

189
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,087
wasn’t any people.

190
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,554
Can he do that?

191
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,954
If he has the power
to control people then…

192
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:03,153
Power that controls people…

193
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,690
Mei Lin-chan,

194
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:10,334
I like you a lot too.

195
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:12,197
Why do you say that?

196
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,606
Because…

197
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,309
No matter what the problem you’re in,

198
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,974
remember me.

199
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,323
Yup.

200
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:34,797
Mei Lin-chan,

201
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:36,560
tomorrow, what time
will your plane come?

202
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,962
– 10 A.M.
– Really?

203
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,764
We have to go to school,
we cant send you off.

204
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:46,804
We’ll see each other later.

205
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:48,365
Maybe you can visit

206
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,140
Hong Kong over the summer.

207
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,870
Then we can see each other.

208
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:55,012
Yes.

209
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,792
What do you want to talk to me about?

210
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,196
If…

211
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:14,862
I have the person that I like.

212
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,999
I wanted to tell you.

213
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:23,272
Someone you like yourself?

214
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:25,734
Yes.

215
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:27,871
I see.

216
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,726
Is it Kinomoto-san?

217
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,388
How do you know?

218
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,454
Because you call her Sakura.

219
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,562
You will call girls by their names

220
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,425
and your sisters will have me.

221
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:01,227
So our engagement is over.

222
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,670
Thanks for the food.

223
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,151
– Where are you going?
– Daidoujii-san’s house.

224
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,038
I haven’t gotten to talk to her today.

225
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,750
– Your going by yourself?
– Shao Lan.

226
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,089
Wait, I’ll go with you.

227
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,428
– You don’t need to.
– Mei Lin.

228
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:33,437
It’ll be ok, I’ll take a cab.

229
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,815
Tommorow I’ll go from Daidouji-san

230
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:37,881
house to the airport.

231
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:40,945
See ya.

232
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,189
Let her go by herself.

233
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:10,174
It makes me mad to death!

234
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:15,880
I was the person
who liked Shao Lan the best.

235
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:23,288
I wouldn’t give him up
for any other person.

236
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:30,033
How come it ended up this way

237
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:33,329
I’m really mad

238
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,504
but I still like Kinomoto-san

239
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,674
I also like Kinomoto-san.

240
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,848
I know that she’s a good person.

241
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:45,208
That Shao Lan likes Kinomoto-san
isn’t a problem.

242
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,219
That’s how I’m thinking.

243
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,448
But I’m crying because of another reason.

244
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,517
Today I’m going to cry until morning.

245
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,635
I want to cry until I die. I want to

246
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,530
cry until I can’t cry
for Shao Lan any more.

247
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,613
– Are my eyes red?
– No,

248
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,652
you look fine
you look exactly as cute as you are

249
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,254
Shao Lan, are you
just going to stand there?

250
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,322
No… um…

251
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,528
Come and help me.

252
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,244
Have you told Kinomoto-san

253
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,040
that you like her yet?

254
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,674
No…

255
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:53,943
You still haven’t told her?

256
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:56,586
Kinomoto-san is that kind of person,

257
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,357
she won’t know unless you tell her.

258
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,392
If you weren’t so cute

259
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,091
then I wouldn’t care about Kinomoto-san.

260
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:03,763
But if you two don’t think about

261
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,023
it really good then I will get you!

262
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,464
Good bye, Shao Lan.

263
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,207
– Mei Lin… 
– Come back to visit on holidays!

264
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:18,935
Mei Lin!

265
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:30,819
Mei Lin has a really good heart.

266
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:32,582
Yeah.

267
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,726
Mei Lin wrote me letters!

268
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,329
I got some too.

269
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,928
What did she write to you?

270
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,140
She said sorry for making my dress wet.

271
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:54,406
What did Mei Lin-chan write to you?

272
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,015
She said that I look like a dummy.

273
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:58,910
So she wants me to

274
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,445
act a little tougher.

275
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:04,155
But she said that my heart is too big,

276
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:05,391
so she’ll forgive me.

277
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:10,418
Still at the end there is something.

278
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,867
What it says,

279
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,204
I dunno,

280
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,137
but I think it is something very nice!

281
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,181
I am very happy!

282
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,656
Stupid Shao Lan,

283
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,428
hurry up and tell her.

284
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,158
I’m in Hong-Kong and the weather
is very good.

285
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:50,093
Mei Lin…

286
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:52,601
My most important friend,

287
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,372
Li Shao Lan.
