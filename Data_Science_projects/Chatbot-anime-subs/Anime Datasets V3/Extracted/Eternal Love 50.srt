<i>[Episode 50]</i>

3
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:14,322
Anyway, I won't leave you before
you meet your destined calamity.

4
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,758
Who told you that I'm going
to meet my destined calamity?

5
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:24,110
Are you not?

6
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,550
Look at me.

7
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,496
Do I look like I'd die soon?

8
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:35,193
You... You don't.

9
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,918
I don't care who told me about it.

10
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,745
You're going to meet your calamity soon.

11
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:44,057
Before that happens,
I'll never leave you, no matter what.

12
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,770
I'll stay by your side every day.

13
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,555
I won't waste a minute on anyone else.

14
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:51,376
I'll cook you anything you wish to eat.

15
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:56,164
I'll go wherever you wish to go.

16
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,067
Your father is here.

17
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,385
It won't chang anything
even if my father is here.

18
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:05,066
I won't listen to anyone!

19
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,270
Lord Dong Hua.

20
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:15,919
What brings High God Bai Yi
to the Nine Heavens so suddenly?

21
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:20,688
I'm here to discuss my sister's wedding.

22
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,454
That's right.

23
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,104
The marriage between the Celestial Tribe

24
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,127
and Nine-tailed Fox Clan
is an important matter.

25
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,872
I'd better not keep you from it.

26
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,215
I'll take my leave.

27
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,128
Father...

28
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,299
You still know that you have a father?

29
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:50,331
Father, no matter how hard
you beat me up this time

30
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,790
I must stay here in the Nine Heavens
to keep Lord Dong Hua company.

31
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:01,449
You really can't give him up?

32
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,653
I can't.

33
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:34,012
Are you thinking about that time
when I took you to the mountain?

34
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:45,300
During the 20,000 years I'd trained
in Kunlun Mountain

35
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,415
we always kept a low profile.

36
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:51,483
It's only been 70,000 years, and
we now keep such a high profile?

37
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,550
They are just in awe.

38
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,598
Once they heard
that High God Mo Yuan had returned

39
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,507
they came immediately to worship him.

40
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,653
Kunlun Mountain is formed by
a protruding dragon's bone.

41
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:03,117
Perhaps it's detected that
Mo Yuan will soon return

42
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,658
so it's welcoming him back
with the divine energy

43
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,723
and hence attracted
all these little deities here.

44
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:12,247
So as not to disturb half a mountain full
of little deities from their fun

45
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,622
we'd better go invisible.

46
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,005
Yes.

47
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,211
High God Mo Yuan!

48
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,055
High God Mo Yuan?

49
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,533
That was High God Mo Yuan in the front!

50
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:32,014
High God Mo Yuan,
welcome back to Kunlun Mountain!

51
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,494
Greetings to Master!

52
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:51,285
I've kept all of you waiting.

53
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:03,281
- Master!
- Master!

54
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,536
Zi Lan sent us news
a few days ago that

55
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,644
the divine energy in
Kunlun Mountain rose greatly

56
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,163
and the bell rang on for a long time.

57
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,973
Although we didn't know what that meant

58
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,898
all the disciples rushed
back here overnight.

59
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,855
We didn't know when Master would
return to Kunlun Mountain

60
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,427
but we all knew that you would
return to Kunlun Mountain.

61
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:24,971
Then in the Eastern Sea

62
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:28,172
I learned that Master had borrowed
my brother's body to nurse your spirit.

63
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,658
Although he took the elixir

64
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,230
I thought that it would
at least take three months.

65
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,951
Yet here in the Grand Hall

66
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,619
we could sense your celestial aura
lingering outside the entrance.

67
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:40,697
We then hurried over here, but still
we didn't arrive in time to welcome you

68
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:42,274
at the entrance of the mountain.

69
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:47,170
Master, you've been away for
70,000 years.

70
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,795
You've finally returned...

71
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,999
Get up now.

72
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,625
Get up.

73
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,290
Master, I have a matter to report.

74
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,153
Ever since Master left

75
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,946
Seventeenth had also disappeared
for some reason unknown.

76
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:50,300
We've been searching for him
all these years to no avail.

77
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,504
I'm afraid that he might
have come to a grim end.

78
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,213
I didn't.

79
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:00,569
This is...

80
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:10,569
Seniors, I am Si Yin.

81
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,533
- Si Yin?
- Si Yin?

82
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,593
- This is...
- Master.

83
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:15,668
This is...

84
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:30,968
Master.

85
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:38,344
- She's Seventeenth?
- Seventeenth?

86
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:47,831
Master, I was the one who
drugged all my seniors back then.

87
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:48,976
What?

88
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:52,836
I then took your body with me
down Kunlun Mountain overnight.

89
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,115
I shouldn't have kept this from Master.

90
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,889
But 16th Senior didn't
mention it just now.

91
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,668
He must be trying to cover it up for me.

92
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,489
- This is...
- This is...

93
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:16,636
Seventeenth?

94
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,197
Seventeenth!

95
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,148
10th Senior did say that

96
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,674
Si Yin must have disguised himself
and went into hiding.

97
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:29,003
All these years
we've search the four seas

98
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,481
and all eight Far Lands
for you but in vain.

99
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:37,879
We know that you were hiding from us,
but little did we expect you to...

100
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:44,995
You'd even dress up as a female deity
to hide from us?

101
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:47,409
This is...

102
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:56,510
Senior Zi Lan, do you really think
that my face is but a disguise of a man?

103
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,014
Is this why
you never had a bath with us?

104
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,971
You're actually a girl?

105
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:08,706
Exactly, she is a girl.

106
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,166
I was worried that
you wouldn't confess to it.

107
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,378
When you arrived dressed as a woman,
I knew what you planned to do.

108
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:19,072
I just didn't dare to say it.

109
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:24,322
Senior, you already knew but there
you stood watching us like some show?

110
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,597
I wouldn't dare treat it as some show.

111
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:30,312
Now that Seventeenth is High God
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

112
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:34,119
nearly all deities have to address her
as Auntie in the realms

113
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,989
I'd have to greet her formally
according to our ranks.

114
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:41,691
Therefore, Sixteenth, how would I dare
speak for Seventeenth?

115
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,751
How would I dare say a word
before she does?

116
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,890
As long as Master is around

117
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:59,178
I'll always be Kunlun Mountain's Si Yin,
and my seniors' little Seventeenth.

118
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:01,307
- Little Seventeenth!
- Little Seventeenth!

119
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,000
Little Seventeenth, come here!

120
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,755
- You're so pretty!
- Exactly!

121
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:09,152
Seventeenth, I didn't even realize that
you're a girl all these years!

122
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,725
- Exactly!
- That's right!

123
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:13,006
- We couldn't tell!
- We didn't know!

124
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:15,653
Exactly!

125
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,529
I miss you all so much!

126
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:26,341
I thought that it would take
Master three months to wake up.

127
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,942
Who knew that it would be so soon?

128
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,971
It's truly incredible.

129
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:38,274
Ye Hua did use up all of his cultivation
to have Mo Yuan revived so quickly.

130
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:40,958
Ye Hua is a true hopeless romantic.

131
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,847
Fifth Sister, you're too unlucky.

132
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:46,750
You've just repaid Mo Yuan's kindness,
and now you owe Ye Hua.

133
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,037
You fed Mo Yuan 70,000 years of
blood from your heart to repay him.

134
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:53,976
How are you going to repay Ye Hua
for his 40,000-year cultivation?

135
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:59,275
I think that since Ye Hua and I
are going to be married anyway

136
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:02,917
a couple should be understanding
and loving of one another.

137
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,634
It's not so important to determine
what we owe each other.

138
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,238
Fourth Brother, what do you think?

139
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll return to my room now.

140
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:57,038
I've brought Peach Blossom wine with me.

141
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,702
Care for a drink?

142
00:12:58,702 --> 00:12:59,812
Sure.

143
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,027
You answered so quickly?

144
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:05,792
In the past
you wouldn't drink so easily.

145
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,705
I have much to ask you.

146
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,129
Wouldn't it seem lonely
to do so without wine?

147
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,993
Why would Seventeenth take
my body back to Qing Qiu then?

148
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,109
I knew you were going to ask about that.

149
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:36,429
Mo Yuan, think carefully
if you truly wish to know.

150
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,409
I've noticed that ever since you woke up
you've been very distracted.

151
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,341
By the time I finish answering
your questions

152
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,673
I'm afraid that you won't know

153
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:49,294
if you only see Bai Qian
as a disciple or more of a woman.

154
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:56,120
Do tell. I wish to know.

155
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,291
After your soul and spirit
were vanquished

156
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,350
Seventeenth sat on Ruoshui Riverbank
holding tightly to your body.

157
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,686
She allowed no one near her.

158
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,221
It was as if she had gone mad.

159
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,443
She wanted to wipe out the Ghost Tribe...

160
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,201
<i>Seventeenth, are you asleep?</i>

161
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,529
I'm already asleep.

162
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,586
<i>You talk when you're asleep?</i>

163
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:25,816
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

164
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,658
Kunlun Mountain hasn't been
so crowded for some time

165
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:35,375
and guest rooms are all taken.
My room is taken by some seniors.

166
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,461
I'll have to make do
in your room tonight.

167
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,340
Then I'll tidy up
another guest room tomorrow.

168
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,355
Seventeenth...

169
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:55,551
It's been tough on you having looked
after Master for 70,000 years.

170
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,505
In the past, my 16th senior would surely
pick on every word I say.

171
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,767
He would always say
the opposite of what I said.

172
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,859
If I said yes, he'd say no.

173
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,648
Yet you're now being nice to me?

174
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,932
Are you still my 16th Senior?

175
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,277
Are you Zi Lan?

176
00:15:15,277 --> 00:15:19,688
Serves you right for being
a spinster all these thousands of years.

177
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,312
You're indeed Zi Lan!

178
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,342
Serves you right for being
a bachelor all these years.

179
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:31,711
By the way, Senior Zi Lan.

180
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,316
Guess what I was thinking?

181
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,788
What were you thinking?

182
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:41,999
I was thinking that
although I'm already so old

183
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,644
and have made many mistakes

184
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:48,870
I suddenly felt that
none of that is regrettable

185
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,201
now as I lie in the small bed
of Kunlun Mountain.

186
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,554
You're right.

187
00:15:55,554 --> 00:16:00,287
After so many years,
it's easier to let go of some matters.

188
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,296
Do you still remember Yan Zhi?

189
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,432
The young princess of the Ghost Realm?

190
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:13,561
Yes.

191
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:19,014
After the battle of Ruoshui Riverbank,
I've never seen her since then.

192
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:23,548
I remember that she's very
righteous and likable.

193
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:27,798
Yes, she is very likable.

194
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,378
You've met her?

195
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,424
I happened to run into her
a few times these years

196
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:36,980
when I left the mountain
to search for you.

197
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,495
Judging by your tone,
you must have fallen in love.

198
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,567
Tell me all about it.

199
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,785
It's getting late. Go to bed.

200
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:51,149
You're going to bed when
we just got to a serious topic?

201
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,532
<i>You're not going to chat with me?</i>

202
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:04,892
<i>I wish I could have a chat
like this with Ye Hua.</i>

203
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:08,530
<i>He wouldn't understand
what I say now?</i>

204
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,490
<i>At this time, he should have just
turned one year old in the Mortal Realm?</i>

205
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,415
<i>I wonder what he looks like
at one year old?</i>

206
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,777
<i>Would he look like Riceball?</i>

207
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:32,432
Right from here.

208
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:37,880
She bled herself and then fed you blood

209
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,919
from her heart carefully
sip by sip from the bowl.

210
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,606
It's fine if she did that to save you

211
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,153
but she didn't know then
if you would even return.

212
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,292
She only did it to preserve your body.

213
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,728
She used her blood as
a nine-tailed fox of Qing Qiu

214
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:02,029
to preserve your spiritless body.

215
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:32,332
Lord Dong Hua...

216
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,278
Who wounded you?

217
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:38,165
My father said that since
I've already lost my chastity

218
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,551
to you in the Mortal Realm

219
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,175
he has to beat me to death.

220
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:43,151
I finally got away from him
just to see you.

221
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:48,433
Then I'll head back to be a filial child
and let my father hit me to death.

222
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,401
Lord Dong Hua...

223
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:54,593
This wound does look real.

224
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,839
You almost got me fooled.

225
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,642
Shouldn't you act out
the whole play better?

226
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:04,041
You should at least flinch when
I touch your wound or say that it hurts.

227
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,762
It hurts!

228
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,311
Make it look more believable.

229
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,268
I've done wrong.

230
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:18,579
It's a fake wound.

231
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,859
Who taught you to do this?

232
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,689
Cheng Yu did.

233
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:35,343
This girlfriend of Third Prince
doesn't know anything better

234
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:39,372
than new tricks to fool people.

235
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:46,201
I asked her for help.

236
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,478
Lord Dong Hua, just blame me.
Don't get her implicated.

237
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,741
Little fox, I already told you in
that shack in the Mortal Realm then.

238
00:19:57,741 --> 00:20:00,959
If you don't break off when you should
you'll only harm yourself and others.

239
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,556
Do you still not understand?

240
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:05,398
The debt you owe me for
saving your life is settled.

241
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:08,951
What brings you here to
my Taichen Palace again today?

242
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:13,018
It's because you're about to meet
your destined calamity

243
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:14,886
so I wish to stay by your side.

244
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,792
Who exactly told you that
I'm about to meet my destined calamity?

245
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:21,759
I can't tell you.

246
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,317
Do you know how much older I am than you?

247
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:33,726
I already looked like this
before your father was born.

248
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:35,817
Hundreds of thousands of years went by.

249
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:40,178
There were numerous of changes
in the world and deaths of creatures.

250
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:41,856
You've witnessed none of that.

251
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:45,326
Nor have you seen my hands
stained with blood

252
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,663
and I frenzied with killing.

253
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,057
Who is it that you're in love with?

254
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,303
Is it the man who stands before you?

255
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,750
Yes.

256
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,278
Yet, Feng Jiu, this man standing
right before you isn't who I really am.

257
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:07,163
The man who teased you in Taichen Palace
wasn't really me either.

258
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:10,805
The man who was in love with you
in the Mortal Realm wasn't me at all.

259
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:15,887
The man before you isn't just
the former God of Heaven and Earth

260
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:19,550
but also a man deprived of
any emotions and affection.

261
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,131
Whatever you do

262
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:25,277
it is but a child's play to me!
I'm Lord Shaoyang of Dong Hua Zi Manor!

263
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:28,890
But...

264
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,037
No buts.

265
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,554
Just leave.

266
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,534
Leave now.

267
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,007
You got frightened off by
Lord Dong Hua just like that?

268
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:51,846
He already saw through my fake wounds.

269
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,772
How could I still stay there?

270
00:21:56,702 --> 00:22:01,835
Star Lord, tell Feng Jiu what
Lord Dong Hua has been through.

271
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:04,714
When Heavenly Lord was still an infant

272
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,791
Lord Dong Hua already ceased wars

273
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,788
and led all gods to pacify the four seas.

274
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:14,599
Certainly, I only learned
of these from the historical records.

275
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,842
Lord Dong Hua is already so old.

276
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:19,885
It's no wonder he is to meet
his destined calamity.

277
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:21,170
Meet his destined calamity?

278
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,546
Lord Dong Hua?

279
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,451
Isn't it so?

280
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:30,412
You follow him around
all day and you're not aware of it?

281
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:34,412
I surely know that His Lordship
won't meet his calamity now.

282
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:36,545
Do you know how severe that is?

283
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,856
Lord Dong Hua was once the God of
Heaven and Earth.

284
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:39,856
If his end is near

285
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:42,465
the Nine Heavens will grieve
and the four seas will be informed.

286
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:45,647
How could it be so quiet
that only the both of you knew of it?

287
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,867
Then...

288
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,464
He won't meet his destined calamity soon?

289
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:50,673
Definitely not.

290
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,875
I can even guarantee
that His Lordship could still live

291
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,449
for some hundred thousand years.

292
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,653
He'd even outlive you, Little Princess.

293
00:22:56,653 --> 00:23:01,222
You mustn't forget that he's the only god
who sprang out of a rock.

294
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,019
He's very tough.

295
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,194
Who told you that Lord Dong Hua
will meet his destined calamity?

296
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:12,296
Cheng Yu did.

297
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,778
I accidentally overheard
Lord of Numinous Treasures talking to

298
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:22,128
Lord Dong Hua about meeting
some sort of calamity.

299
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:24,901
I thought it meant Lord Dong Hua.

300
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:28,144
It's no wonder Little Princess
showed up looking all forlorn.

301
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,913
Why didn't you ask me about it?

302
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:33,644
I'm the deity who's been
around His Lordship the longest.

303
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,750
If Lord Dong Hua isn't meeting
his destined calamity

304
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,489
what I just did today is
simply too shameful.

305
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:50,435
If my father learns of it,
he will surely hit me to death.

306
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,338
I wonder if Lord Dong Hua
has some time to talk to me

307
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:15,554
about that unfilial daughter of mine
Bai Feng Jiu?

308
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:19,853
High God, please have a seat.

309
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,632
What would you like to talk about?

310
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:36,096
I'll be frank with you.

311
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:41,461
Since you and my daughter were
once husband and wife in the Mortal Realm

312
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:46,284
I wonder if you could realize
her dream by marrying her.

313
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,157
Although I've often reprimanded her
for embarrassing Qing Qiu

314
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,518
by wooing you and following you around

315
00:24:54,518 --> 00:25:01,308
I could tell as her father
that she's very devoted to you.

316
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:08,724
I've come here today as a father
to propose marriage for my daughter.

317
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:11,934
I hope that Your Lordship will
consider this marriage.

318
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:16,166
Since High God is so sincere,
I will be honest with you.

319
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:19,638
Your daughter and I
are never meant to be together.

320
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:36,554
I'll take my leave.

321
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,788
Come out here.

322
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,202
Lord Dong Hua...

323
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:10,584
How long do you plan on fooling around?

324
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:13,260
I... I was mislead by someone

325
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,269
into thinking that you won't
have long to live.

326
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,570
Hence, I wanted to accompany you
until your end.

327
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,603
Even if I don't have long to live
who are you to accompany me?

328
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:26,884
In the Mortal Realm, we were once...

329
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:27,909
That means nothing.

330
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:29,010
It meant everything!

331
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,068
You were once my husband.

332
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,608
That was just you.

333
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:40,036
Feng Jiu, how many times
would you have me say this?

334
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,914
Whatever you had with me in the
Mortal Realm was but a heavenly trial.

335
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,438
Don't get your hopes up.

336
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,518
It's useless to do so.

337
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,957
We're not meant to be.

338
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:55,128
That's impossible...

339
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,665
That's impossible...

340
00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:00,686
Dong Hua, if you feel nothing for me

341
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,539
why would you still go to that shack?

342
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,345
You couldn't forget me.

343
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:08,150
Since you can't forget me,
why won't you give us a chance?

344
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,462
Back in the Mortal Realm...

345
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,596
That's enough!

346
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:01,788
Why?

347
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,603
Why would you be so cruel to me?

348
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,807
I treat everyone in the same manner.

349
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:11,154
It's not so...

350
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:13,705
It shouldn't be so...

351
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:16,192
Do you have a reason for doing so?

352
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,942
Could you tell me?

353
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:23,843
Do you know why
your father came to see me?

354
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:30,387
He begged me to marry you.

355
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:37,211
My father... begged you to marry me?

356
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,824
Exactly.

357
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:46,627
You still wouldn't marry me
even after my father begged you?

358
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,378
Indeed.

359
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:54,827
This is my fault.

360
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:58,559
This is all my fault.

361
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,034
My father has never begged anyone.

362
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,451
Not once.

363
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,461
I shouldn't behave like this...

364
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:09,961
I shouldn't embarrass Qing Qiu.

365
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,040
I've shamed Qing Qiu.

366
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:18,150
I shouldn't keep pestering Lord Dong Hua!

367
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,127
Father...

368
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,037
You find it shameful now?

369
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:16,059
All right now, let's leave.

370
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,180
Why are you looking at me?

371
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,689
Little Princess left early this morning.

372
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,557
Is there nothing you wish to ask?

373
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,366
Say what you will or just shut up.

374
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:26,265
You were once the God of
Heaven and Earth.

375
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:28,444
When the four seas were at peace

376
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,742
you passed on the throne to
the former Heavenly Lord

377
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:33,468
and then to the current Heavenly Lord...

378
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:34,897
Get to the point.

379
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:42,154
I think that Little Princess followed you

380
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:45,046
to Celestial Palace
to repay your kindness

381
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:47,775
and she willingly descend to
the Mortal Realm as a concubine.

382
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:51,111
Yet that isn't enough to win you over.

383
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:56,311
As an onlooker
I felt bad for Her Highness.

384
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:04,326
Star Lord, have you ever broken up
any couples on the Book of Destiny?

385
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:07,050
Certainly.

386
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,217
If it's clearly written on the book
that two people aren't meant to be

387
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:17,579
would they still have a chance?

388
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:24,038
Unless I make a few changes to it,
it's impossible.

389
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,646
If it were stated on the
Rock of Three Incarnations

390
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,308
that they aren't meant to be?

391
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,888
The Rock of Three Incarnations?

392
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,436
My Lord, in just a few days

393
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:08,380
the rumors of Old Ghost Lord's return
are already spread to the small clans.

394
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,930
It's said that he's returned
to punish you, the rebellious son.

395
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,455
Those clan leaders who support you
are all very troubled.

396
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:17,881
After all, the Ghost Realm
isn't as powerful as it used to be.

397
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:20,949
Everyone hoped that it could
be restored to its former glory.

398
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,598
My Lord, if we don't come up
with countermeasures

399
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:25,063
we are in for trouble.

400
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:29,195
Among the generals, most of the loyal
ones are killed by High God Bai Qian.

401
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:32,128
The remaining ones are once
faithful subjects of Old Ghost Lord.

402
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,884
They are all eager to take actions
after hearing such rumors.

403
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,808
Some of them are observing
the situation before making a decision.

404
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,807
When we got here, we visited
five or six of our peers.

405
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,329
None of them would see us.

406
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:46,813
In the end, only the both of us came.

407
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,268
If we could restore
the realm to its past glory

408
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,869
I'm willing to give this throne up.

409
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:03,218
However, we can't wait for
my father to return.

410
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:08,679
Judging by my father's past temperament,
he wouldn't care about his people.

411
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:20,157
Once he leaves the bell,
I'm sure he will avenge himself.

412
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:23,891
He would bring the entire world down
for the 70,000-year-suffering he endured.

413
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,376
We both share the same opinion.

414
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:28,505
Therefore, I'd never support
Old Ghost Lord.

415
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:31,164
We'd follow Ghost Lord to death!

416
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:37,965
Who would have known that only the both
of you stayed by my side until the end?

417
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:44,199
Perhaps, I have to carry out
a drastic plan in Grand Ziming Palace

418
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,181
to protect the Ghost Realm
and even the world.

419
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:56,771
Transfer our trusted soldiers over here
and safeguard Grand Ziming Palace.

420
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,018
- Yes!
- Yes!

421
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,163
Brother Li Jing.

422
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,269
Am I incompetent?

423
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:16,925
You're not!

424
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,652
70,000 years ago before that battle
it was the prime of the Ghost Realm.

425
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:27,373
Everyone misses those days and wishes
to restore the realm to its past glory

426
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:29,856
so they blame it all on you.

427
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:33,641
However, all the wealth
and military power

428
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:36,436
of the Ghost Realm
were used up in that battle.

429
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:39,260
You're the one who took over
the Ghost Realm

430
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,403
and restored it bit by bit
to how it is now.

431
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:44,619
If it had been some other Ghost Lords

432
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,954
they couldn't have done
any better than you did.

433
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,509
Whatever it is you wish to do,
I'll definitely assist you.

434
00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:00,293
I'll seek audience with the Crown Prince
in the Celestial Palace first.

435
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,030
Crown Prince Ye Hua?

436
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:06,134
Exactly.

437
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,375
<i>[Xiwu Palace]</i>

438
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:27,893
Ghost Lord.

439
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:34,322
I'm here to seek audience
with the Crown Prince.

440
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,460
The Crown Prince?

441
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,804
He won't be in the Celestial Palace
for two months.

442
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,594
- He's not in the Celestial Palace?
- Exactly.

443
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:43,849
Do you know where he's gone to?

444
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:47,431
This... Do forgive me that
I'm not allowed to tell you.

445
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:55,733
There's a joyous occasion
in Xiwu Palace?

446
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:58,666
Yes. Heavenly Lord has
invited Fox King over.

447
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,362
I reckon that in a few months

448
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:03,157
Ghost Lord will receive a wedding
invitation from Xiwu Palace.

449
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:09,360
You're referring to the
Crown Prince and A-Yin?

450
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:15,076
No, I should call her High God Bai Qian.

451
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:16,289
Indeed.

452
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:22,282
I'd congratulate them in advance.

453
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,864
I'll take my leave now.

454
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:52,835
Master, you must be tired.

455
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,981
I've made you some hot tea.

456
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:21,152
It's been 10 days already.

457
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:23,045
Why are there still so many visitors?

458
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:26,282
I wonder how the news of
Master's return got out?

459
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:30,108
All living creatures with
a bit of spiritual powers

460
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:34,032
knew that the ancient God of War
Mo Yuan has returned.

461
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,471
Here's what was said.

462
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,728
It's said that Master arrived at the peak
of Kunlun Mountain majestically

463
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:42,820
wearing a rose-gold crown
an armor of evergreen sacred wood

464
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,375
and a pair of ankle boots with
his Sword of the Yellow Emperor

465
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,467
as well as a sweet
young lady in his hands

466
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,262
on August 16th at a quarter to two
in the afternoon!

467
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,835
When Master landed at the peak

468
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:56,876
the entire mountain range
along Kunlun Mountain shook thrice.

469
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,266
All birds and beasts chirped
and howled to the sky.

470
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:02,938
Even the arowanas surfaced
and wept out of surprise!

471
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:06,222
Some tale this is.

472
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,518
It's not exactly all wrong.

473
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,686
The rose-gold crown, sacred wood armor

474
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,737
ankle boots and the Sword
of the Yellow Emperor...

475
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:14,313
Those are Mo Yuan's usual battle gear.

476
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,762
For the past 70,000 years

477
00:39:15,762 --> 00:39:18,101
they have been kept in
the main hall of Kunlun Mountain

478
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,661
to be worshiped by the disciples.

479
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:24,630
As for that sweet young lady
it should be referring to you?

480
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:31,369
A young lady is a bit far-fetched
but a sweet young lady?

481
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,898
That's horribly wrong?

482
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,516
Seventeenth.

483
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:37,570
At your age
you should already be married

484
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,034
or even have had quite a few children?

485
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,099
When do we get to meet your husband?

486
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:47,980
Judging by your looks and temperament
who knows what husband you married?

487
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,588
That's not a problem.

488
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:53,068
I'll invite all of you to
my wedding in two months.

489
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:58,360
- Grand Master.
- Grand Master.

490
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,965
More worshipers have arrived.

491
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:04,420
We'll take our leave.

492
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:18,114
He's already had quite a few visitors.

493
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,548
It's about time to get some rest.

494
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:21,568
Master just left like that?

495
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:24,302
What are we to do
if more worshipers arrive later?

496
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,592
Take them all
to the main hall for tea.

497
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,074
Send them out after
they finish their tea.

498
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:32,583
Do you have enough tea?

499
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:35,829
Yes, there's plenty.

500
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,460
Master seems a bit strange?

501
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,009
When Bai Zhen and I
spoke of your marriage

502
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:51,706
we thought that you're naturally
slow-witted in affairs of the heart.

503
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,007
But you're not so bad as a deity.

504
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:57,199
Romance wise, you know nothing.

505
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:01,427
Fourth Brother said that to me as well.

506
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,481
The exact same words.

507
00:41:05,394 --> 00:41:07,492
You really are slow-witted.

508
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,956
So slow-witted!

509
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,871
It's quite clean in here.

510
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:33,659
It should be.

511
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,840
Kunlun Mountain hasn't been
occupied for thousands of years.

512
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,177
Yet this elixir cauldron
hasn't stopped working at all.

513
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,288
Why is that so?

514
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:44,239
Your fiance didn't tell you about it?

515
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,983
Ye Hua?

516
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,775
He's never mentioned it.

517
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:54,014
That night, the Crown Prince came here
covered in blood with an arm bitten off.

518
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,753
He gave me quite a fright.

519
00:41:55,753 --> 00:41:58,532
I thought that he was hurt
and came to seek help at Kunlun Mountain.

520
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:00,858
Who knew that he was here to
create an elixir?

521
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:03,646
Who do you think he did it for?

522
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,436
Why did he have to come to
Kunlun Mountain?

523
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:08,117
Why didn't he use the elixir cauldron
up in the Nine Heavens?

524
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:15,355
He left the Nine Heavens

525
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:18,923
because he didn't want anyone
to know about the elixir he was making.

526
00:42:21,135 --> 00:42:25,623
He made that elixir for my sake.

527
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,400
It was for your sake?

528
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,494
Crown Prince is so devoted to you.

529
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,297
All right, I'll leave you to your chores.

530
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:33,844
I'll prepare dinner for everyone now.

531
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:34,844
Yes.

532
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,164
<i>He suffered so much for me.</i>

533
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:43,588
<i>Be it the divine fungal grass
or the loss of his cultivation</i>

534
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,768
<i>that's what I owe Mo Yuan for
his years of mentoring.</i>

535
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>Yet he...</i>

536
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:05,668
