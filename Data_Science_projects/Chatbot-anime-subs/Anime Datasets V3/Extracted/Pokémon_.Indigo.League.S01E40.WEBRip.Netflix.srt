You're not going to give up your dream
that easy, are you?

-But--
-If your show's no good,

So is his act.

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,595
Pika-pika.

157
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,641
All my life,
I've dreamed of becoming a magician,

158
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,019
entertaining people,
seeing their faces light up.

159
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,605

-Huh?
-Pika.

164

What kind of a magic show?

165
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,494
I'll do a Pokémon magic show.

-Uh, fire.
-Okay.

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,564
[laughing]

177
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,028
Water vanish!

178
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,739
[sizzles]

179
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,408
Squirtle.

180
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,494
-Char?
-[grumbling] Squirtle. Squirtle.

181
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,246
Squirtle. Squirtle.

182
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,123
-Bulbasaur.
-Squirtle!

183
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,207
-Squirtle!
-Char.

184
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,250
-Squirtle!
-Char.

185
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,167
Cut it out!

186
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,961
What's happening?

187
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,715
Stop it. Quit fighting!

188
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,591
Ah!

189
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,592
[screams]

190
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,593
[all whimper]

191
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,304
Squirtle

192
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,515
I guess I need a bigger box.

193
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,684
-Squirtle
-Char.

194
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,477
[all] Exeggcute.

195
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,397
So the only Pokémon you have
are Exeggcute?

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,314
That's right.

197
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,692
They don't really do very much, do they?

198
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,904
[all]
Exeggcute! Exeggcute! Exeggcute!

199
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,574
Why are you staring at me?

200
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,161
[all]
Exeggcute! Exeggcute! Exeggcute!

201
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,871
[all] Exeggcute!

202
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,039
Stop it, Ash.

203
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,750
A staring contest
isn't going to get you anywhere.

204
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,045
-I'd like all of you to stop now.
-Exeggcute.

205
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,880
-Okay.
-[all] Huh?

206
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,095
Turn around three times
and act like a Bulbasaur.

207
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,767
-Exeggcute.
-Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur.

208
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,644
-Pika-pi--
-What's with Ash?

209
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,897
He's acting kind of weird.

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,857
Hmm.

211
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,359
Aha.

212
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,322
Keep going straight into the leaf forest.

213
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,491
-Exegg--
-Yes, master.

214
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,994
I hate to do this to you,
but I hate exercise.

215
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,999
It looks like that magician
has the little brat under his spell.

216
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,876
They're just where we want them.

217
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,419
What's our plan?

218
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,173
We follow them and see what they're up to,
then we make our move.

219
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,467
With Melvin?

220
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,178
Yeah, someone saw them
headed for the leaf forest.

221
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,515
Pika-pika pika.

222
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,227
Ash and Melvin must have just
come through here.

223
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,646
But why would Ash have gone with Melvin?

224
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,189
-Wait a minute.
-Huh?

225
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,692
[all]
Exeggcute. Exeggcute. Exeggcute.

226
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,031
What if Ash was put under hypnosis attack
by those Exeggcute

227
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,574
and now they're controlling him?

228
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,370
They belong to Melvin,
so he's making Ash do whatever he wants.

229
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,124
-Mm-hm. Keep looking, Pikachu.
-Pika.

230
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,209
Stop.

231
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,627
[Exeggcute] Exegg!

232
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,048
Now, Ash, you say
that you want to become a Pokémon master.

233
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,384
-Yes.
-Then use your Pokédex

234
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,803
-and tell me what those are.
-Yes.

235
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,181
[Pokédex]
<i>Exeggutor. A coconut Pokémon.</i>

236
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>Also known</i>
<i>as the walking tropical rainforest.</i>

237
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>Each coconut has a distinct face</i>
<i>and its own character.</i>

238
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,566
<i>Its special attack is hypnosis.</i>

239
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,861
I'd like you to battle these Exeggutor
for me.

240
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,070
Yes, master.

241
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,824
Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, attack.

242
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
-Squirtle.
-Bulbasaur.

243
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,871
-Char. Char!
-[Exeggutor roaring]

244
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,832
Now I'll capture all the ones you weaken.

245
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,670
One Exeggutor.

246
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,922
Squirtle!

247
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,678
Now I've got two Exeggutor.

248
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,180
-Char!
-Exeggutor.

249
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,932
Squirtle!

250
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,267
Bulbasaur!

251
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,187
I've got another one and another one
and another one and another one.

252
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,939
Char!

253
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,774
[roaring]

254
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,192
Bulbasaur!

255
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,445
[laughing]

256
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,196
[all panting]

257
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,700
Look at all the Exeggutor I've caught.

258
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,703
-That's all for now.
-Yes.

259
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,788
Return, everyone.

260
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,166
Now that I've captured these Exeggutor,

261
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,793
I can put everyone at the carnival
under hypnosis

262
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,296
and command all of them
to come see my magic show.

263
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,132
At last, I'm finally on my way
to Las Vegas.

264
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,717
[all] Exeggcute! Exeggcute!

265
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,594
In your dreams.

266
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,720
Who's that?

267
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,640
Prepare for trouble.

268
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,266
Make it double.

269
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,146
-To protect the world from devastation.
-To unite all peoples within our nation.

270
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,232
They look more like magicians than I do.

271
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,652
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

272
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,113
To extend our reach to the stars above.

273
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,324
Jessie.

274
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,495
-James.
-Alakazam kalamazoo!

275
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,830
Pesto!

276
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,208
That was great. You guys are wonderful.

277
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
[Jessie] It's not over yet.

278
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,338
Team Rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

279
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,257
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

280
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,761
Meowth. That's right.

281
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,346
[laughs]

282
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,599
If you were a real magician,
you'd be able to do tricks like that.

283
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,517
That's right.

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,894
They're right. My magic stinks.

285
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,146
You obviously have no talent
as a magician,

286
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,524
but you're good
at catching Exeggutor for us.

287
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,359
Now we'll make them disappear.

288
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,528
And we'll use their hypnotic power

289
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,863
to capture all of the Pokémon
in the world.

290
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,948
No, you can't.

291
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,868
-You have...
-...no choice.

292
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,870
Stop it. Let me go.

293
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,372
-Hey.
-Huh?

294
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,125
Be quiet,
or I'll knock the cholesterol out of you.

295
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,626
[all] Exeggcute.

296
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,003
That's better.

297
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,797
Now, there's something
we need you to do for us.

298
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,800
[all] Exeggcute. Exeggcute.

299
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,302
-Huh?
-It's looking at us strangely.

300
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,220
Yeah.

301
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,556
-Could it be...
-...some sort of magic?

302
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,892
-No, it's...
-...evolving.

303
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,478
Exeggutor.

304
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,564
[all] It's an Exeggutor.

305
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,734
-Uh, I'm feeling...
-A bit sleepy.

306
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,653
Hypnosis waves are coming out of its eyes.

307
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,656
Well, then just don't make eye contact.

308
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,742
[all] Exeggutor.

309
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,993
Too late.

310
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,995
-I'm going...
-...under.

311
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,915
-Good work, Exeggutor.
-Exeggutor.

312
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,923
Exeggutor, no more hypnosis.

313
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,926
[all] Exeggutor.

314
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,847
Exeggutor. Exeggutor. Exeggutor.

315
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,849
What happened?

316
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,393
Hey, where are all of you going?

317
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,312
Whoa.

318
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,776
I don't get the respect I think I deserve.

319
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,611
Ah. Look, over there.

320
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,196
The forest is moving.

321
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,533
That's no forest.
That's a herd of Exeggutor.

322
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,118
[both scream]

323
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,540
What...? What's going on? Ah!

324
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,959
-Team Rocket.
-Exeggutor. Exeggutor.

325
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,420
Ash. Ash.

326
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,464
-Are you okay, Ash?
-Melvin.

327
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,592
Pikachu, you've got to do something
to help Ash, quick.

328
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,345
-Pikachu!
-Ah!

329
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,721
What's going on?

330
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,390
I don't remember anything.

331
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,725
You were under deep hypnosis.

332
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,728
Hypnosis? Oh, yeah. Where's Melvin?

333
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,729
Ash.

334
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,357
What's going on here?
What have you done, Melvin?

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,403
The Exeggutor used hypnosis on each other
and got all confused.

336
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,239
The Exeggutor are heading into town
right now, Ash.

337
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,408
Oh, we got to stop them.

338
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,993
Now they're beyond my control.

339
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,912
[grunts]

340
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,956
[lively music playing]

341
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,166
[creaking]

342
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,336
-Hey, what's that noise?
-[woman] The forest is moving.

343
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,547
No. Those are Exeggutor.

344
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,428
-[crowd screaming]
-Exeggutor. Exeggutor. Exeggutor.

345
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,432
Looks bad.

346
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,101
They must have stampeded
right through the carnival.

347
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,019
-Hey! You better get out of here!
-Huh?

348
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,062
[all] Hm?

349
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,524
Those Exeggutor are coming back this way.

350
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,902
I've planted a time bomb in this clearing.

351
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,030
It'll blow up
just as they make it to this field.

352
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,533
[explosion]

353
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,703
You can't.
Those Exeggutor are under hypnosis.

354
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,956
They don't realize what they're doing.
It's not their fault.

355
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,668
Who cares? We can't let them cause
any more damage to the town.

356
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,962
Now, get out of here and fast!

357
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,964
Wait. Come back.

358
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, why are people so stubborn?

359
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:13,681
-What are we supposed to do now?
-Now I'll have to stop them myself.

360
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,893
You're coming with us, Melvin.

361
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,896
[all] Exeggutor. Exeggutor. Exeggutor.

362
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,108
Squirtle. Bulbasaur. Charmander. Attack!

363
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,155
Squirtle, water gun.

364
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,240
Squirt!

365
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,743
That should wake 'em up.

366
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,079
Ash, it looks like
they're liking the water.

367
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,332
Bulbasaur, razor leaf attack now.

368
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,338
Don't prune them. Stop them.

369
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,590
Squirtle and Bulbasaur, return.

370
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,968
Charmander, flamethrower.

371
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,513
Char!

372
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,351
The Exeggutor are waking up.

373
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,852
Stop, Exeggutor!

374
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,689
Exeggutor are weak against fire.

375
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,984
All right. Charmander,
rapid fire flamethrower attack.

376
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,279
Char!

377
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,283
Char!

378
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,869
Char!

379
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,787
-Char!

380
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,624
Exeggutor! Exeggutor!

381
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,671
Hurry, Ash. Don't forget, that time bomb's
going to go off any second.

382
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,798
I know. I know, but--

383
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,384
Char!

384
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,387
-Oh, Charmander.
-Pika.

385
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,225
We've got to stop those Exeggutor
before they reach the time bomb.

386
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,310
Wait. I've got it.

387
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,188
Melvin, you can wake all of the Exeggutor

388
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,399
at the same time
with your fire magic trick.

389
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,819
Huh? But all I ever do
is make a mess of things.

390
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,070
I can't do it.

391
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,114
But, Melvin, you have to try.

392
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,283
You said it was your dream
to be a magician.

393
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,870
You've got to wake these Exeggutor
for their sake and for yours.

394
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,080
[sighs]

395
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,459
I know I can't do it.

396
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,671
You can do it.
Just look at Ash's Charmander.

397
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:14,093
If that little Pokémon worked that hard,
then you have to at least try.

398
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
[sighs]

399
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,018
Then I'll give it my best shot.

400
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,269
Melvin.

401
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,938
Melvin, Charmander, it's up to you.

402
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,273
-Char.
-Uh-huh.

403
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:32,278
-Raging fire!
-Char!

-What?

-I did it.
-[Exeggutor] Exeggutor. Exeggutor.

410
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,046
I did it.

411
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,881
I really did it.

412
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,051
-Yeah. A great job, Melvin.
-[all] Huh?

413
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,598
Exeggutor, your hypnosis spell is broken.
This is so wonderful.

414
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,269
Wow. That was a close call.

415
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,147
You're right.
Thank goodness no one was hurt.

416
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,399
Char. Char?

417
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,902
What's the matter, Charmander?

418

Pika?

419
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,154
