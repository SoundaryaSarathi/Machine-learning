00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,040
Heat haze

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
That was my middle school.

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,300
Let's go see.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,500
Okay.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
You used to wear those too?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Yeah.

22
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,500
Looks like middle schoolers from the country.

23
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,700
Jeez.

24
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Hello.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Hello.

26
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,600
He owns a tea shop in the neighborhood.

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,200
I see.

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
It sure is cold today.

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,800
You're right. It looks like it might snow.

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,100
My...

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,900
You must have left home very early to get here this early.

32
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,000
Sorry. We just suddenly decided to come.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
That's right

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,600
I slept over at my brother's house last night.

35
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,500
I see. You guys must get along very well.

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh yeah. What's that?

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,500
Oh, that?

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,900
That's just for a little change of mood.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,300
Oh.

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, take your time.

41
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,300
Yeah.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes? Welcome. The usual?

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,900
Yes, please. Oh yes, the shampoo you gave me last week, it's so good...

44
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Koshiro?

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,900
Yeah?

46
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,400
Do be careful.

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm not a pro, so I'm not sure if I can fix it.

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,300
I think it's because a tile is cracked.

49
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
Could you at least try?

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,700
The leak is terrible.

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,100
I guess it can't be helped.

52
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,500
Man, it's freezing.

53
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Is it fixed?

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Probably... Actually, I don't know.

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Eh, what? Which one?

56
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
That's because the kid next door...

57
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Even if that's so, this is so bad.

58
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Ah! Don't look!

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,700
You really do look like a middle schooler from the country.

60
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,800
Just because there aren't many photos of you, brother. It's not fair!

61
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,400
Jeez...

62
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh, yeah. I found these too.

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Your collection of compositions from elementary school.

64
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Ah, mom, not that.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,100
"My dream is to become a beautician."

66
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,900
Jeez...

67
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,400
"That is because my mother is a beautician, so I want to take after her."

68
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,300
"I will also get married. I want lots of children."

69
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,400
"I will call my mother, father and brother and we'll all live together."

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,200
"Then I think it will be a lot of fun."

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
So she said.

72
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,500
It does seem like a lot of fun, though.

73
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,400
Your husband is going to have a tough time.

74
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Umm...

75
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
Sorry for dropping in all of a sudden.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Umm... I'm sorry.

77
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,700
What are you saying?

78
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,400
You actually helped me out a lot.

79
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,500
At this rate, I would like you to come everyday.

80
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Bye then...

81
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,300
Good night.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,300
Be careful on your way back.

83
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Should we commit lover's suicide?

84
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,800
I don't mind either way.

85
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,200
If you're okay with it, then I don't care which.

86
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Don't say things like that.

87
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
I can't decide which...

88
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:00,300
I don't know... what to do... so easily...

89
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Let's go home.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
If you're not sure, then let's just go home for now.

91
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,700
I think it's fine to go home and then think it over.

92
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,700
Are you okay with that?

93
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm fine.

94
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,900
That's why I said that I'm fine as long as I'm with you, brother.

95
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,080
And in the end, we're still alive.

96
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,090
Resignation

97
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,480
Unable to find the answer to...

98
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,180
What the right thing to do is...

99
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,080
Yo!

100
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,080
Hey.

101
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,480
You really did quit?

102
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
Yeah.

103
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,380
I really did quit.

104
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
What are you going to do from now on?

105
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,080
I haven't decided yet.

106
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,580
You sure do have absolutely no direction in your life.

107
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,080
If you're not able to do anything anymore, then you should just come back.

108
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,080
If I'm not able to do anything?

109
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Do you really think it'll solve itself?

110
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
Sorry. I said that I wouldn't say anything anymore, didn't I?

111
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,080
Whatever happens... I can't wish you good luck, but...

112
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,080
Stay well.

113
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,780
Bye, now.

114
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's go home, Nanoka!

115
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Do you want to do some karaoke on the way?

116
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,880
Sorry, but there's somewhere I have to go.

117
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,780
Next time.

118
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,480
She doesn't hang out with us much anymore.

119
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,680
Yeah.

120
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
I bet it's a boyfriend.

121
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,380
I wonder.

122
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,880
Probably, most likely.

123
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,380
Yeah.

124
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,880
Do you want to follow her?

125
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,580
Let's follow her!

126
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,880
I want to see what kind of guy he is!

127
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Nanoka's boyfriend!

128
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,580
But...

129
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,580
You guys peeped at my date!

130
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,680
Let's go!

131
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,180
What's wrong?

132
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Let's not.

133
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,080
I'm kind of scared.

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,780
I'm sorry...

135
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
I'm sorry.

136
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,480
The one thing I do know is...

137
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm home.

138
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Welcome home.

139
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,380
I'm home.

140
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
Let's eat.

141
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,980
This moment...

142
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,180
Itadakimasu.

143
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,180
...is something that I don't want to let go of.

144
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880
Do you have everything?

145
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,580
Yeah, I'm fine.

146
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,680
Suburban shopping malls are the trend of life.

147
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,180
But if this place is gone, then I think that many people will be sad.

148
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,180
Actually, there are more people in favor than in opposition.

149
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,040
There isn't that kind of an institution around here, so...

150
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,170
I think many of the residents felt that it was inconvenient.

151
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,390
Ah, is that so?

152
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,580
I feel that destroying the row of trees would be wasteful.

153
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,080
But I guess you can't do business with just sentiment.

154
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,780
Sorry, but you...

155
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,970
Why, you!

156
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,620
No!

157
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,380
Come here, you...

158
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,140
Stop it.

159
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,750
You rascal!

160
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,880
I'll go clean myself.

161
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,090
Yeah.

162
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,830
Here!

163
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,010
For me?

164
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,730
Thank you.

165
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,210
What are you doing?

166
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,250
Come here.

167
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Hey...

168
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Hurry, brother!

169
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,080
Amusement parks are...

170
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,380
Hmm?

171
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,580
...fun even if they aren't moving.

172
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,910
Is that so?

173
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,180
Wow!

174
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
How disappointing...

175
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,210
That it doesn't move.

176
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,920
I thought you said that it was fun even if it wasn't moving?

177
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
The ferris wheel is different.

178
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,050
You sure are hard to please.

179
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
But... it's better if it moves.

180
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,580
I bet it would be beautiful.

181
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,880
The town.

182
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,980
Yeah.

183
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,290
I wonder if we can't move it.

184
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,520
I was wondering if we can move it somehow.

185
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,080
How?

186
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,020
By praying.

187
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,620
Ehh...

188
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,320
You don't know unless you try.

189
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,850
But...

190
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,220
Come on, you try praying too.

191
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,550
It's impossible!

192
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,120
Don't give up so easily.

193
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,120
Come on, once more.

194
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,720
Ready...

195
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,690
We did it!

196
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,950
We did...

197
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,850
I can't believe it!

198
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,550
Once more, again!

199
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Yeah...

200
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,750
Aren't we doing something stupid?

201
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,550
You're the one who started it!

202
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,000
Don't say that!

203
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,900
Ready? One... two...

204
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,850
Really... what are we doing?

205
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,200
Nanoka

206
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,520
Here.

207
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,850
Let's come again!

208
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,020
Sure.

209
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,140
Every year, when it's spring.

210
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,880
Yeah.

211
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,110
It's a promise!

212
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,410
Yeah.

213
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,190
I'm going home then.

214
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,290
Do you want to take a bath at my place first?

215
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,690
I'm fine like this.

216
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,590
I see...

217
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,950
Bye!

218
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,290
Ah!

219
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,590
Ah, no... It's nothing.

220
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,890
What?

221
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,090
It's nothing.

222
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,990
Later.

223
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,990
I love you.

224
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,990
I love you!

225
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,010
