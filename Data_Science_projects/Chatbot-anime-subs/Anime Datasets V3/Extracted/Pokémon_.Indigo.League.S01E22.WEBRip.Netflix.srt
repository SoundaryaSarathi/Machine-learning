00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,161
Gastly.

183
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,417
Might as well check in this room first.

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,044
[Misty]
Maybe we should just get out of here.

185
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,922
Nah, there's no way we can turn back now.

186
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,007
We've got to go in.

187
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,678
Uh, hey, ghost Pokémon,
if you're in here, say hello.

188
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,346
I'm going to capture you.

189
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,974
Don't say that. If they know
you're trying to capture them,

190
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
they won't come out of hiding.

191
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,268
You're right.

192
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,519
[laughs]

193
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,979
-Char, char.
-Pika...

194
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,189
-What's this?
-It looks like...

195
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,190
Huh?

196
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,277
It looks like some kind
of fancy restaurant.

197
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,904
Maybe it's a party
or some kind of reception.

198
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,157
But who's it for?

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,533
[Ash]
What's that string?

200
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,618
[Brock]
There's something written on the card.

201
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,287
[Misty]
It says "pull this."

202
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,872
[Ash]
Well, why not?

203
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,623
[Misty]
Wait!

204
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,295
-[Ash] Are we...?
-[Misty] Being welcomed?

205
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,796
[Brock] By who?

206
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,506
[Misty] Look!

207
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,800
[all] Huh?

208
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,763
[all screaming]

209
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,223
Whoa! Help me!

210
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,183
[all screaming]

211
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,351
-Ah!
-Hold on!

212
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,772
Ah!

213
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,148
[both screaming]

214
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,191
Come on!

215
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,442
Jump!

216
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,651
-Pika.
-Char.

217
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,611
[screams]

218
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,613
-Pika, pika, pika.
-Char!

219
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:40,497
[all laughing]

220
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,417
Gastly. [laughing]

221
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,962
[Misty panting]

222
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,507
There is no way
I'm going back in that tower.

223
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,050
It's just too scary in there.

224
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,301
Me neither.

225
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,844
What are you saying?

226
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,890
There's no way we can capture a ghost
Pokémon if we don't go back in there.

227
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,642
Right, Pikachu? Charmander?

228
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,519
Pi... Pi...

229
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,687
Char!

230
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,565
[all groan]

231
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,568
Hold on! Are you two really cowards?

232
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,196
How do you expect to beat
Sabrina's psychic Pokémon

233
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
if you don't go back in?

234
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,741
-Do you want to lose again?
-Pi...

235
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,123
Cha! Cha!

236
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,459
Cha.

237
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,379
Listen, if you're ever going to beat
psychic Pokémon,

238
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,215
you got to learn to overcome your fear,
understand?

239
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,884
-Pi...
-Mander.

240
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,848
I say it's time to give it another try.
Pikachu, Charmander, are you with me?

241
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,224
-Pi.
-Char.

242
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,601
Great. Let's do it!

243
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,192
Come on, guys. What about you?

244
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,029
-We'll both be waiting for you right here.
-Have a nice time.

245
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,406
[all] Wah!

246
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,956
[Ash] Hello, everybody.
We're back.

247
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,458
We'd love to meet you.

248
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,670
Feel free to introduce yourselves
whenever you like.

249
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,547
Huh?

250
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,675
What was that?

251
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,680
[Pokédex]
<i>Ghost Pokémon are in a vapor form.</i>

252
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,975
<i>Their true nature is shrouded in mystery.</i>

253
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,438
Oh, well.
Guess I'll try to solve the mystery.

254
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,524
-[Meowth] Cut it out.
-[James] Could you please knock that off?

255
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,401
-[Jessie] What's this?
-[James] Stop it.

256
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,905
They're down there.
Time for us to go get them.

257
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,740
Pikachu, electric attack.

258
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
Pika.

259
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,534
Pikachu!

260
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,122
[screaming]

261
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,501
Charmander, flamethrower, now.

262
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,669
Char!

263
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,838
[screaming]

264
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,757
[Ash] Hey, it's working.

265
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,675
Go, Poké Ball!

266
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,801
Huh?

267
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,219
Ouch.

268
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,223
[sobbing]

269
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,684
Huh, I wonder if I captured it.

270
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,312
Oh, it's that stuck-up little brat again.

271
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,231
I'll get him
if it's the last thing I ever do.

272
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,193
Someday, I'm going to make him pay dearly
for what's he's done.

273
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,320
She's got fire in her eyes.

274
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,113
Yeah, and in her hair too.

275
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,075
Huh?

276
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,285
[squealing]

277
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,746
[Ash] Hey, a fireball.

278
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,210
He's going to pay for this.

279
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,587
Aw, the fireball's gone.

280
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,214
Guess we'll get it next time.

281
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,132
Pi. Pika, pi!

282
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,510
Huh? What's what?

283
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,054
You must be seeing things.

284
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,013
Huh?

285
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,683
Uh...

286
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,060
[all] Argh!

287
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,020
[laughing]

288
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,939
Is this a ghost Pokémon?

289
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,190
[bleeping]
[Ash grunts

<i>No further information.</i>

292
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,155
Huh? Is that all?

293
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,534
Well, we're not going to lose
to some stupid ghost Pokémon.

294
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,077
Go, Charmander.

295
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,036
Huh?

296
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,295
Don't bother me now, Pikachu. Quit it.

297
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,048
Cut it out.

298
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,091
Uh...

299
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,926
[Ash screams]
[Haunter laughs]

300
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,678
I'm not afraid of you.

301
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
You just surprised me a little bit.

302
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,391
-Charmander, you're on.
-Char!

303
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,353
Charmander, time to use your leer attack.

304
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,398

Bah!

307
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,446
Huh?

308
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,865
[laughing]

309
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,326
What are you doing, Charmander?
You're not supposed to make it laugh.

310
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,245
Mander?

311
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,290
[whimpers]

312
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,751
Oh, this isn't working.

313
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,877
Charmander, return.

314
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
Bah!

315
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,257
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?

316
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,216
Gengar...

317
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,551
Pika-pi!

00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,179
Gengar. Gengar.

319
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,222
There are more of these?

320
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,141

I better find out about this one.

326
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,572
Not again.

[laughing]

329
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,957
I don't get it. They're weird.

330
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,084
Huh?

00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,212
[squeaking and grunting]

332
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,214
Are you guys trying to be funny?

333
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,174
Your routine really isn't working for me.

but their humor really leaves me cold.

00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,902

-[Ash] Hey! Don't go!

-You're saying we're alike now?
-Pika?

Oh, no! We've been totally separated
from our bodies!

No way. I don't want to be a ghost yet.

[Ash screams]

361
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,344
Ah, no! Wherever you're taking us,
we don't want to go.

00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,805
Ah!

00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,562
[Ash] Ah! Oh, what a view.

364
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,273
-Ah!
-Pikachu.

365
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,486
Huh? [chuckles]
Now's our chance to have some fun.

366
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,362
Pika.

367
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,239
Ash is taking too long.

368
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,492
I think we'd better go in
and see how he's doing.

369
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,743
That's a good idea.

370
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,162
So, Misty, you're really worried about me.

371
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,121
Huh?

372
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,414
What's wrong, Misty?

373
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,292
I just thought I heard a voice.

374
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,961
-Come for a ride with me, Misty.
-[screams]

375
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,630
-[Brock] Ah! Misty!
-Help!

376
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,756
[Ash laughs]

377
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,050
The ghost has got me!

378
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,552
Okay, ride's over. Catch her, Brock!

379
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,096
[Brock grunts]
[both groan]

380
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,265
Wait a minute. That voice...

381
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,477
I think something terrible's happened
to Ash.

382
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,231
Yeah!

383
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,858
[all laughing]

384
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,737
[Ash] I'm flying!

385
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,660
Ah, cool.

386
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,828
[all sigh]

387
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,372
Ah!

388
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,750
[screams]

389
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,918
Ah!

390
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,878
You fooled me.

391
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,547
[all laughing]

392
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,506
[laughing]

393
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,924
Pikachu.

394
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,012
Whoa.

395
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,598
Wow, look at all these toys.

396
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,600
Pikachu!

397
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,269
Haunt, haunt, haunt.

398
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,729
Gengar, Gengar, Gengar.

399
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,190
Gastly, Gastly.

400
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,233
Huh?

401
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,152
Do you mean you only wanted somebody
to play with?

402
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,113
-Gengar, Gengar.
-Haunt, haunt, haunt, haunt.

403
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,448
Really? Was that all?

404
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,952
You just wanted to have some fun,
not scare people?

405
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,287
-[Pikachu] Chu.
-Huh?

406
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,164
-Gastly, Gastly.
-Pikachu. Pika, pika.

407
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,626
I understand how you must have been bored
for such a long time.

408
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,586
That's tough.

409
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
[groaning]

410
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,592
I'm sorry, but I can't stay with you
and play with all these great toys.

411
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,053
There are still lots and lots of opponents
out there for me to battle.

412
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,515
I have to fulfill my dream
of becoming a Pokémon master.

413
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:20,975
[both] Hmm.

414
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,561
Sorry, but I really have to go.

415
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,187
[moaning]

416
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,981
I'll miss you all.

417
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,525
[sobbing] Uh...

418
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,486
[sighs]

419
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,364
Ash? Pikachu?

420
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,782
Come on, wake up.

421
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,535
-Oh, Ash, can't you hear me?
-Please say something.

422
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,664
Ash, open your eyes. Please, Ash.

423
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,084
Huh,
I guess it's time to go back, Pikachu.

424
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,044
[all sigh]

425
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,003
Whoa.

426
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,011
Hi, Misty.

427
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,763
Huh?

428
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,722
You're alive.

429
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,931
Pika.

430
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:01,974
Pikachu.

431
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,435
Hey, guys. Sorry to worry you.

432
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,437
No sweat. Glad to have you back.

433
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,899
[sobs softly and chuckles]

434
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,653
[laughing]

435
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,155
[laughs]

436
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,201
But, Ash, what about the ghost Pokémon?

437
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,037
Ah, it's impossible to catch them.

438
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,083
What? Then how are you ever going to beat
the psychic Pokémon?

439
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,544
Hmm, maybe I'll have to use
my sense of humor.

440
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,129
[both] Huh?

441
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,214
Pika!

442
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,173
[both] Huh?

443
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,800
Huh?

444
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,718
Blah!

445
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,763
[screaming]

446
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,722
[laughs]

447
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,266
Pika. Pi, pika, pi.

448
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,102
Pikachu!
