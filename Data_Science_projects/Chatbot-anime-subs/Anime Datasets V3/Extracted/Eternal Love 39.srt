<i>[Episode 39]</i>

3
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
And you...

4
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,360
When I felt the strongest for you,
you knocked me down.

5
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,919
You only saw that I let go easily

6
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,159
but did not see how sad
and miserable I was.

7
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,439
When my master passed away

8
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,719
despite my abject heart

9
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
I went to Grand Ziming Palace
to borrow the soul jade from you.

10
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,919
You will never understand
how much courage I had to summon.

11
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,500
Nor will you ever understand
how sorely you disappointed me.

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,080
It wasn't like that.

13
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,199
I did not know you were
seriously injured at the time.

14
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,400
If you had told me you were using
blood from your heart

15
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,719
to preserve Mo Yuan's body

16
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,960
I never would have withheld it from you.

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,439
I didn't give you the soul jade then

18
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,960
because I knew you were
protecting Mo Yuan.

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,759
Yes, I envy him. I envy Mo Yuan.

20
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,199
But, A-Yin, I actually...

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,639
I have never forgotten you.

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Can you forgive me?

23
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Ghost Lord, you say today that
you never forgot me.

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,000
That is only because
you are always searching

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,783
for things you cannot attain
or that you have lost.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,479
Once you possess them,
you no longer cherish them.

27
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,439
Are you saying this
just to lessen your own guilt?

28
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Actually, you have never
loved me, have you?

29
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,639
You were able to let go so easily
when Xuan Nu and I came together.

30
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,720
You already hated me, didn't you?

31
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,600
Who doesn't make mistakes?

32
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,839
You are the love of my life.

33
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,480
Why can't you forgive me?

34
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,040
After what you did

35
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,519
do you still expect me
to share a husband with Xuan Nu?

36
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,040
After leaving Grand Ziming Palace,
I did blame and hate you.

37
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,720
But when I lost too much blood
in Yanhua Cave

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,399
and my life was hanging by a thread...

39
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,160
I discovered that your face
was not what I saw in my head.

40
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,680
That was when I knew
my heartbreak was over.

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,439
I was finally free.

42
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,519
A-Yin, don't say any more.

43
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,319
Li Jing.

44
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,480
You are indeed the only man
that I wholeheartedly loved

45
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,704
in all my 140,000 years.

46
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,720
It's just that too much time has passed.

47
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,920
We cannot return to the way we were.

48
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,759
I understood this too late.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,360
And so...

50
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,439
you aren't in the same place,
waiting for me.

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,360
From now on, we are acquaintances.

52
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Farewell.

53
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
They were clearly such sweet words.

54
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,519
But how come they sounded
so heartbreaking coming from you?

55
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Look at the sky.
I'm afraid it'll be raining soon.

56
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,319
We should hurry.

57
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,779
Are you here to see Aunt?

58
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,439
Didn't she just return last night?
Where has she gone now?

59
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,480
To the Celestial Palace.

60
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,519
The Crown Prince said

61
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,000
the Lord of Numinous Treasures
has a Heavenly Spring.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,879
A soak in it will aid Aunt's recovery

63
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,319
so he took Aunt to the Nine Heavens.

64
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,720
Where is Zhen Zhen?

65
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,245
Fourth Uncle has gone to the market.

66
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,218
He said he was going
to pick ingredients himself

67
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,000
to cook dinner for you.

68
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,519
He isn't Feng Jiu.
Is his cooking edible?

69
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,240
It'll just be torture for me.

70
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,000
By the way, I came for
another important matter.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
A few days ago, when Bai Qian
brought Mo Yuan back

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,759
did she bring him back to Yanhua Cave?

73
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,199
Yes, Mo Yuan is still in Yanhua Cave.

74
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,271
However, it wasn't Aunt
who placed him there.

75
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,920
When she returned, she was very
injured and unconscious.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,360
It was the Crown Prince who
brought Mo Yuan back.

77
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,639
Why don't you take me to see Mo Yuan
since Zhen Zhen isn't back yet?

78
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,920
All right. Please follow me.

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,519
I can go in by myself. You can head back.

80
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
Don't tell anyone yet
that I came to see Mo Yuan.

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,759
Yes, High God.

83
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,679
Zhe Yan! Come, let's drink.

84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,120
What wine is this?
It's certain to be inferior to mine.

85
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,039
It seems you've wasted your money again.

86
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,919
This is already
the best wine in Qing Qiu.

87
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,679
Just bear with it for today.

88
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm afraid I won't have the time today.

89
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,320
I must hurry back to
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

90
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,039
Back to the woods?

91
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,279
Didn't you say you were going
to stay in the Fox Den for a few days?

92
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,159
I thought of a way that could
save the West Sea's eldest prince

93
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,360
but I must hurry back to the woods
to look through my medical texts.

94
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,399
Is that true?

95
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,399
Then hurry.

96
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,919
Come back soon!

97
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
<i>It is as I expected.</i>

98
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,200
<i>Kunlun Mountain is a divine mountain
formed at the apex of dragon bones.</i>

99
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,000
<i>It was abandoned after Mo Yuan left.</i>

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,679
<i>Now, there is a faint trace
of divine energy</i>

101
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,583
<i>bubbling up from
the base of the mountain.</i>

102
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,279
<i>There is surely some
unusual activity happening here.</i>

103
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,799
High God Zhe Yan.

104
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,919
You are...

105
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,559
Second Disciple of Kunlun Mountain.

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,039
I saw you before
when Si Yin became a disciple.

107
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,879
That's correct. I had the fortune
to see you then.

108
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,120
When I was feeding
Master's cranes just now

109
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,840
I heard them crying out simultaneously

110
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,799
and knew an honored guest
must have arrived.

111
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,559
I did not expect it would be you.

112
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,759
May I ask what you have come
to Kunlun Mountain for

113
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,080
and how I may help?

114
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
When the Heavenly Father passed away

115
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,120
I had the artifact, Fuxi Zither,
permanently sealed under Kunlun Mountain.

116
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,080
So many years have passed
in the blink of an eye.

117
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
I suddenly longed to see
this companion of mine

118
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,679
so I came to take a look.

119
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,559
I once heard Master mention
that magical artifact.

120
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,080
High God, please go ahead.

121
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,799
Are you now the only disciple left
at Kunlun Mountain?

122
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,080
In the past 70,000 years

123
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,240
those who had families,
returned home to help out

124
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,270
while those who didn't have families

125
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,480
continued searching for
Seventeenth and Master.

126
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,240
Zi Lan returned recently
and cleaned the place inside and outside.

127
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,000
Ghost Lord came by unexpectedly
and said he had seen Si Yin.

128
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,159
Zi Lan was overjoyed and said he was
leaving to search the Mortal Realm

129
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,440
and told me to take care of the cranes.

130
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,399
Ghost Lord said he had seen Si Yin?

131
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,879
I don't know if it is the truth.

132
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,240
However, Zi Lan was restless
and left to search.

133
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,799
Even Qing Qiu's entrance
has Mi Gu guarding it.

134
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,679
But this Great Overarching Heaven,
holding 36 heavens

135
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,600
doesn't even have someone
guarding the door?

136
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,480
How unimposing.

137
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,799
The Supreme Venerable Sovereign
began a sermon today.

138
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,279
I suppose they have all left
to attend the assembly.

139
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,159
So there is an assembly?

140
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,490
Qian Qian.

141
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,299
I heard that while you
were helping Yuan Zhen

142
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,799
through his trial in the Mortal Realm

143
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,879
you often discussed Taoism
with Yuan Zhen.

144
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,360
You must be well-versed in Taoism now.

145
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,759
In the past dozens of millennia

146
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,679
nobody has been a good match to debate
the Supreme Venerable Sovereign.

147
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,000
It is quite lonely at the top.

148
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,120
Now that you are here,
you can debate with him.

149
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,279
You flatter me.

150
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,480
I heard the Heavenly Lord granted you
the name of Xiwu Palace

151
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,840
when you were establishing your official
residence when you were 30,000 years old.

152
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,519
That's correct.

153
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,279
It's so dim inside.

154
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,799
It's like the Crystal Palace of
the Eastern Sea during the banquet.

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,360
That's because
you can't stand bright lights.

156
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,080
Because of me?

157
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,480
Qian Qian.

158
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,080
I'll bring you inside.

159
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Who knew that to get to the Nine Heavens,
I'd have to jump in

160
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,860
instead of walking through
the front entrance?

161
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,559
To walk in from the front

162
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,879
all the halls high and low
would have been alerted.

163
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,279
All the commotion
would have been annoying.

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
It wouldn't have been
as convenient as jumping in.

165
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,879
That is reasonable.

166
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,379
Oh, yes.

167
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,679
We are here early today.

168
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,120
Jia Yun hasn't delivered
your official documents yet.

169
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Don't tell me you didn't tell him
not to send them to Qing Qiu

170
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,279
so he'd save his trip?

171
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,480
You were right.

172
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,740
It's a good thing we didn't enter
through the front door

173
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,840
and alert all the other immortals.

174
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,559
Otherwise, it would have been
very troublesome.

175
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,200
Anyhow, we returned late last night.

176
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,639
Have you made any progress on the
official reports that have piled up?

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
<i>The Crown Prince always looks serious
and calm as an immortal, like Dong Hua.</i>

178
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,279
<i>But today, he's displaying an expression
that only a youthful man would have.</i>

179
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,519
<i>It is rare indeed.</i>

180
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,159
I have something to discuss with you.

181
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,679
You are suddenly so serious.
What could it be?

182
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,799
It isn't anything serious.

183
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,080
I will be recuperating here in
the Nine Heavens for a few days.

184
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
Since I came in secret

185
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,960
I didn't make known
my title as High Goddess.

186
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,600
I mustn't have you arrange chambers
for me with great fanfare.

187
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
Why don't I stay in
Riceball's Qingyun Hall for two days?

188
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,840
You want to stay in A-Li's Qingyun Hall?

189
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
Would it be inconvenient?

190
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
I...

191
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
I have already prepared chambers for you.

192
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,000
By the way, about my master...

193
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Nobody else will know.

194
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,200
You have peach blossoms
in your hall as well?

195
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,364
Were they brought over from
the Heavenly Peach Garden?

196
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,680
I planted these 300 years ago.

197
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Only this year have they finally
blossomed for the very first time.

198
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,759
300 years for the first blossom?

199
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,960
You sure have patience.

200
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,200
The Hall of Beautiful Youth?

201
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,000
That is a nice name.

202
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
It fits well with Xiwu Palace.

203
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,440
<i>Ever since I stepped into this hall</i>

204
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,799
<i>why have I felt uneasy and uncomfortable?</i>

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,640
High Goddess, have some tea.

206
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,880
Your Highness!

207
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,039
Your Highness, it really is you!

208
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,640
I have waited for you for 300 years.

209
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,160
You've finally returned!

210
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,119
Crown Prince's Soul-gathering Lamp
truly is a sacred item!

211
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,279
Your Highness looks no different at all!

212
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,519
You must be mistaken.

213
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,000
I am Bai Qian of Qing Qiu,
not the lady you speak of.

214
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,920
Nai Nai.

215
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,599
This is High Goddess Bai Qian
of Qing Qiu.

216
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,920
She will be staying here for a few days.

217
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
You will attend to her.

218
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
Stand up.

219
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
She will be going to the Lord of
Numinous Treasures' Heavenly Spring.

220
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,319
Go make preparations.

221
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,359
Yes.

222
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,000
Rest for now.
I'll bring A-Li here.

223
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,279
All right.

224
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
What?

225
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,279
High Goddess Bai Qian has come
to the Nine Heavens?

226
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,799
Yes, Your Highness.

227
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,799
She entered from
the South Heavenly Gate just now.

228
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,240
She is now in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

229
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,720
What did you say?

230
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,839
The Hall of Beautiful Youth?

231
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,319
That place...

232
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,119
Didn't His Highness
never allow anyone to go near it?

233
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,880
I also find it strange.

235
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,920
It is reasonable to say that
in these 300 years

236
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,319
His Highness has always safeguarded
the place where that mortal lived.

237
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,519
How come he has suddenly allowed
another woman to live there?

238
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,079
Xin Nu.

239
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,599
I think this Bai Qian...

240
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,279
will be harder to to deal with
than I had imagined.

241
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,240
Why does Your Highness say that?

242
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,519
His Highness has broken his own rules
again and again for her.

243
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,839
It's as if he has lost his mind.

244
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,160
I had comforted myself before
by saying that it is all right.

245
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,799
At least the one His Highness
loves the most is dead.

246
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
But now...

247
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,839
Xin Nu.

248
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,119
You will help me, right?

249
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,759
No matter what

250
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,599
you will help me win back
Ye Hua's heart, won't you?

251
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,599
Rest assured, Your Highness.

252
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,319
I will always be
your most capable assistant.

253
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,519
I will definitely help you.

254
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,480
Your Highness, do not be afraid.

255
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,119
She has just arrived in the Nine Heavens.

256
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,960
She is not familiar with this place yet.

257
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,319
We have been living in the
Celestial Palace for dozens of millennia.

258
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,759
Yes.

259
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,200
I must not panic.

260
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,720
I am the side consort who was
officially wed into Xiwu Palace.

261
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,559
I shouldn't panic.

262
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,119
I should wait and see...

263
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,960
how I can force her back.

264
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,880
Has the Crown Prince always liked
peach blossoms so much?

265
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,599
My lady really liked peach blossoms.

266
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,839
After she left, the Crown Prince
planted peach trees all over the hall.

267
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,960
Are you referring to A-Li's mother?

268
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,759
You have heard of her before?

269
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,920
When I first met A-Li, he told me.

270
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,519
My lady left after she gave birth
to the young prince.

271
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,319
The young prince was raised by me.

272
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Mother!

273
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,839
You're here.

274
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,000
Nai Nai, what's wrong?

275
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,559
It's nothing.

276
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,200
My hand slipped. Please forgive me.

277
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,680
<i>Riceball's mother has already passed away</i>

278
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
<i>and cannot enjoy
the joys of having a child.</i>

279
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,160
<i>Yet, I have gained that pleasure
as the stepmother.</i>

280
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,319
<i>This maid must find it hard to watch.</i>

281
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,519
<i>What a faithful and devoted maid.</i>

282
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,720
Mother, I want a hug.

283
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,079
I am not feeling too well.

284
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,079
Have your father hug you.

285
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:27,039
I know. You're going to have
another baby, aren't you?

286
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,079
That's what's written in the books.

287
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,119
It said a madam was with child

288
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,599
and her family wouldn't allow her
to hold a child from another family

289
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,839
because they were afraid she would...

290
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,599
Yes, disturb the fetus.

291
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,039
You are only as tall as garlic sprouts.

292
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,599
How come you know about
disturbing a fetus?

293
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,440
A-Li.

294
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,279
Who gave you that book?

295
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,440
It was Cheng Yu who lent it to me.

296
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,480
Cheng Yu again.

297
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
This Cheng Yu sure is
an interesting person.

298
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,759
Even if you were pregnant,
why would you be blushing?

299
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,039
I'm delighted.

300
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,680
If Mother has a baby

301
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,599
then I won't be the youngest
in Heaven anymore.

302
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,759
Qian Qian, why don't we have one
as soon as we are married?

303
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,680
If you are the one to
give birth to the baby

304
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,000
I would be very happy to help.

305
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,559
Since A-Li is here, why don't we
all go to the Realm of Supreme Purity?

306
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,839
Let's go.

307
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,640
Greetings, Crown Prince.

308
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,119
Ye Hua, if I were to come here
as your wife

309
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,839
how many maids would lead the way for me?

310
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:07,519
10. Why?

311
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,279
I feel as if my rank
would actually be decreasing.

312
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,103
This isn't a good deal for me.

313
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:14,279
When we accede to Heavenly Lord
and Heavenly Empress

314
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,680
there will be 24 maids
to lead the way for you

315
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,200
as well as 4 dexterous ones
to rub your back.

316
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
That sounds nice.

317
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,720
Greetings, Crown Prince.

318
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,759
There's wine here?

319
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,440
These are fruit wines.

320
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,839
If A-Li wants some,
you can give him a little

321
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,680
but he must not drink too much.

322
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,680
You can also let him eat
some seasonal fruit

323
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
but limit him to only half of each fruit.

324
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,000
It's really not easy for you
to be his mother and father.

325
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,720
It's been so many years.
I'm used to it now.

326
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,599
The peach blossoms on your fan
look very nice

327
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,799
but you're missing an appropriate poem.

328
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,559
Why don't you take a soak
and I'll add a poem for you?

329
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,200
You can come to the study to find me.

330
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,559
All right.

331
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,880
Mother, how come Father left?
Isn't he having a soak with us?

332
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,319
The Heavens have assigned
an important task to your father.

333
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,160
He's gone to do his duty.

334
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,119
You liked peach blossoms as a mortal.

335
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,000
Who knew that as a high goddess,
you would still have the same taste?

336
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,319
<i>Qian Qian, whether I am lying to myself</i>

337
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,920
<i>or you're just an expert
at concealing things</i>

338
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,279
<i>the affection between us may not be
as deep as what you had with Mo Yuan...</i>

339
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,960
<i>but you are the only woman
I have ever loved in my life.</i>

340
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,440
<i>I am willing to wait for you.</i>

341
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,480
<i>I will wait for you to forget Mo Yuan
and truly fall in love with me.</i>

342
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,720
Sister, were you looking for me?

343
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,519
His Highness finally returned
to Zichen Hall today.

344
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,759
If you don't seize this chance

345
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,359
you can't blame me for not helping you.

346
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,799
I don't really understand what you mean.

347
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,640
This is a restorative tonic.

348
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,000
His Highness has finally
returned to Xiwu Palace.

349
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Be more accommodating and
attend to His Highness's needs tonight.

350
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,200
If His Highness is upset...

351
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,519
You don't understand this man.

352
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,519
If he has intimate relations with you,
he will bear the responsibility.

353
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,039
You also don't have to be afraid
that he will be angry.

354
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:10,279
First, you are A-Li's savior.
He won't take your life.

355
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,359
Second, you have me.
I will protect you.

356
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,960
After all, I am the only one
you can rely on in Xiwu Palace.

357
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,400
And other than you,
I don't have any sisters.

358
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,240
Thank you, Sister.

359
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,039
Please enjoy, High Goddess.

360
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,400
The last one was plum wine.
What is this one?

361
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
High Goddess, this is loquat wine.

362
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,680
Loquat?

363
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,559
I loved eating loquats
with A-Li in Qing Qiu.

364
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,400
Yes, my mother loved to feed me loquats.

365
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,039
He's drunk?

366
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,759
His body is so hot.
He doesn't seem to be faking it.

367
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,599
He has such a low tolerance.

368
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,000
This is the first time His Highness
has drunk so much wine.

369
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,599
He is so drunk. I think I should take him
to the Medicine King's manor for a look.

370
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,799
There's no need. I've been drinking
for dozens of millennia.

371
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,799
I'm almost an expert.

372
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,720
The wine A-Li just drank
was fermented from divine fruit.

373
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,920
It is not intoxicating,
no matter how much one drinks.

374
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,000
But I'm still worried about any mishaps.

375
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,759
He is boy. He doesn't need to be
so pampered and spoiled.

376
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,640
Listen to me. Take him back
and let him sleep.

377
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,240
He'll wake up in six hours.

378
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,480
Yes.

379
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,160
Please enjoy.

380
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,079
This young maid is still so devoted
to her old mistress.

381
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,440
Hasn't her old mistress
been gone for 300 years now?

382
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,599
High Goddess, I do not know much
about Xiwu Palace.

383
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,440
Do you not all know what happens
in the Crown Prince's palace?

384
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,279
I only heard that something happened
in Xiwu Palace.

385
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,000
The palace maids and guards at the time

386
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
were demoted to the lower realm's
Deity Mountain by the Heavenly Lord.

387
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
<i>It seems the Heavenly Lord
has been very thorough</i>

388
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,400
<i>in covering up this incident.</i>

389
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,799
<i>He even replaced the palace maids.</i>

390
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,880
<i>No wonder why when I was in Qing Qiu,
I only heard the Ye Hua doted on Su Jin</i>

391
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,809
<i>and that he had
no other consorts in his palace.</i>

392
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,240
<i>Thus, I naturally thought that Su Jin
was the mother of his only son.</i>

393
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,920
This is my first time in
the Celestial Palace.

394
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,400
I am not familiar with the pathways here.

395
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,119
Please lead the way for me
to the Crown Prince's study.

396
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,359
Please follow me, High Goddess.

397
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,359
Your Highness.

398
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,839
What is it?

399
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,599
I have been waiting
for Your Highness for a long time.

400
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,200
Your Highness has finally returned.

401
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,880
Will Your Highness
listen to me say a few words?

402
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,799
In the beginning, I saved
the Imperial great-grandson

403
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,279
and thus, I had the chance to serve
Your Highness for a few days.

404
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,200
It was my good fortune.

405
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,359
However, because of this

406
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:59,319
I requested permission from you to
allow me to be a maid at Xiwu Palace.

407
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,559
It was a vain attempt to obtain
Your Highness's favor.

408
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,400
That was wrong of me.

409
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,920
I have decided to leave the Nine Heavens
today and return to the Eastern Sea.

410
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,720
This soup tonight will be
the last I make for Your Highness.

411
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,160
Will Your Highness eat it

412
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,960
and consider it an end to
the relationship between you and me?

413
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,359
There is no relationship
between you and me.

414
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,640
However, you once saved A-Li's life.
You and I were also master and servant.

415
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,839
This soup will mark the end of that.

416
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,960
That's not necessary.

417
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,720
Do you really want me to eat this?

418
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,400
I made this soup myself.

419
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,920
Of course I hope that
Your Highness will eat it.

420
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,599
It is a token of my appreciation.

421
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,039
Your Highness, why?

422
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,400
I'd like to ask you
a few questions first.

423
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,840
What would Your Highness like to ask?

424
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,840
A few days ago,
you went to the Eastern Sea.

425
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,679
I really missed my brother
so I went back to visit him.

426
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,760
Did you know that on the day
you visited your brother

427
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,800
Dong Hua Dijun was going through
a trial in the Mortal Realm?

428
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,960
I did not know.

429
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,719
That day, Dong Hua Dijun was pushed
into the water in the Mortal Realm.

430
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,039
At the same time, High Goddess Bai Qian
was also pushed by someone.

431
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,760
I had sealed all her powers.

432
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
She nearly drowned.

433
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,519
Is that so? That's very dangerous.

434
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,920
It was very dangerous.

435
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,840
Do you know what identity and status
High Goddess Bai Qian has in this world?

436
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,280
Neither Qing Qiu nor the Celestial Tribe
would forgive the one who pushed her.

437
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Miao Qing.

438
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,400
Do you truly not fear

439
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,360
that your brother and the Eastern Sea
will be incriminated as a result?

440
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,840
Do you truly not fear

441
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,824
being permanently reborn as an animal
for harming a high goddess?

442
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,440
I had a moment of weakness!
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

443
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,159
If it weren't for that fact that
you saved A-Li's life

444
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,440
do you really think you could have
lived to see this day?

445
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,119
I was a fool!
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

446
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,119
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

447
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,039
Now tell me. What is in the soup?

448
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,960
The...

449
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,960
In the soup...

450
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,065
is something that can make
Your Highness like me after eating it.

451
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:19,760
It's that powerful?
Who gave it to you?

452
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,480
I... I bought it in the Mortal Realm.

453
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,599
The Mortal Realm?

454
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,039
Did you really think this elixir from
the Mortal Realm would work on me?

455
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,800
I only...

456
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,639
Your Highness!

457
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,159
I heard the maids saying

458
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:42,159
Your Highness was chastising
Sister Miao Qing.

459
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,719
I don't know what she has done

460
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,800
but it must not have been malicious.

461
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,880
It must be because
she admires Your Highness too much.

462
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,440
On account of the fact that
she once saved A-Li

463
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,840
I hope Your Highness can
forgive her this time.

464
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,119
<i>Is there nobody standing guard here?</i>

465
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,360
<i>Don't tell me I had the luck</i>

466
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,304
<i>to stumble upon someone else's amusement
in a lady's chambers.</i>

467
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,559
<i>Ye Hua may be rather calm and indifferent</i>

468
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,320
<i>but he is young and vigorous after all.</i>

469
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,840
<i>All the maids in Heaven are quite pretty.</i>

470
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,440
<i>It must be agonizing
to look at dull reports all night.</i>

471
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,599
<i>If he raises his head</i>

472
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,119
<i>and sees a maid as pretty as a painting
by his side serving him</i>

473
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,079
<i>he would naturally want
to take her to bed.</i>

474
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,519
<i>I should stay away.</i>

475
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,039
<i>Qian Qian.</i>

476
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,400
<i>What are you doing coming and going?</i>

477
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,199
I've finished the inscription
on the fan. Come in and get it.

478
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,239
<i>Never mind.</i>

479
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:19,559
<i>Let me see what a maid
you take a liking to looks like.</i>

480
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,880
Here.

481
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,760
What's happening here?

482
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
<i>What beautiful eyes.</i>

483
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,000
<i>It's a shame that although
this maid is pretty</i>

484
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,639
<i>she is not worthy of these eyes.</i>

485
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,599
Your eyes are very pretty.

486
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,519
Su Su...

487
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,880
Princess Miao Qing.

488
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,960
I truly have no place
for you in Xiwu Palace.

489
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,840
Return to the Eastern Sea
tomorrow morning.

490
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,679
If you do not overstep your bounds again

491
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,199
I will not pursue past events.

492
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,280
Consider it repayment
for saving A-Li's life.

493
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,119
Su Jin.

494
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,519
You seem to value
this friendship very much.

495
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,199
If you can't bear to part with
Princess Miao Qing

496
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,679
why don't you ask the Heavenly Lord
to issue a decree

497
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,000
to have you married off
to the Eastern Sea?

498
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,599
Your Highness, I was
momentarily possessed.

499
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,960
That's why I used a drugged soup
to try to seduce Your Highness!

500
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,079
Your Highness, no matter how
you punish me, I won't resist!

501
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,440
Even if I must be struck by
49 bolts of lightning every day

502
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,639
I will not be afraid!

503
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,199
I only ask that Your Highness
not make me leave Xiwu Palace.

504
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,480
My life's only wish is to
remain by Your Highness's side

505
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,599
and serve Your Highness
for the rest of my life!

506
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

507
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,079
Last time, I mistook you for another.

508
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,699
You helped me once.
Please help me again!

509
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,800
Your Highness.

510
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,079
Since Princess Miao Qing
has knelt in front of me...

511
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,840
even if I kneel, it would still be
inappropriate for me to refuse her.

512
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,239
I must say a few things.

513
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,559
Go ahead.

514
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This really isn't only
Princess Miao Qing's fault.

515
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,400
You knew she had feelings for you,
yet you still brought her up to Heaven.

516
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,139
I know you did it to repay her
for saving A-Li.

517
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,139
You also let her escape
her marriage arrangement.

518
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,230
You thought she would return to the
Eastern Sea after she came to her senses.

519
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,719
But that might not be what she thought.

520
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,880
She must have thought
you'd fallen for her as well.

521
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,119
Since you gave her that idea

522
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,239
and seemed like such a man of honor,
so slow to make your move

523
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,559
she must have felt forced
to make a move herself.

524
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,400
But in the beginning

525
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,744
she said she would be content
just to be a maid in Xiwu Palace.

526
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,360
How can you believe
the words said by a woman in love?

527
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,960
Listen to me.
Hurry back to the Eastern Sea.

528
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,519
She is my wife

529
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,679
as well as the only lady of Xiwu Palace.

530
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,679
Since she has said it

531
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,280
you should return to the Eastern Sea,
Princess Miao Qing.

532
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,079
Your Highness.

533
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,840
Your Highness, Your Highness!
