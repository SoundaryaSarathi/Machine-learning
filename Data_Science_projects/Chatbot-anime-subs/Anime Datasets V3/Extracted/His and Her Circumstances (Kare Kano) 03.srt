950
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,703
What's happened so far!

951
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:14,406
This is our sister,

952
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,593
Miyazawa Yukino, 10th grade!

953
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:18,261
At first glance, she's elegant and
graceful, blessed with both beauty and wit.

954
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,664
Although she comes from a middle-class family...

955
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,767
...once you saw her you'd think she was
someone with intelligence, culture, and grace.

956
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,017
But in reality,

957
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,437
she lives only to show off in front of others...

958
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:28,372
...hiding her true

959
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:30,022
identity behind a mask.

960
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,474
But the other day,

961
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:33,876
Sis screwed up and

962
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,161
her other persona was discovered!

963
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,215
This guy is the real model of a perfect student:

964
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:39,516
Arima Souichirou.

965
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:40,266
He gets excellent grades,

966
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:43,750
is good at every sport and is generally a
sociable guy who would never make any enemies.

967
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,623
And he's a thoroughbred from a famous family
of doctors dating back to the Edo Period.

970
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:49,658
But he's quite
a scoundrel himseIf!

971
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,262
He schemed to make Sis help him with
his work by mercilessly exploiting her weakness!

973
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,501
Combined with feeling love for the first time,

974
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,002
Sis was falling fast into big trouble.

975
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:03,539
She finally snapped after a period
of total ineffectiveness, but...

978
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,441
However. . . 
After much fuss, they made peace.

979
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Since they both have
reputations to protect...

981
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
...they became comrades
sharing the same secret...

982
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
...and it looks as though everything will be all right.

983
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,684
But, however...!

984
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:36,754
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

985
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,513
Why'd I remember that all of a sudden?

986
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,782
I'd forgotten it long ago...

987
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:02,513
I think Arima's been acting weird lately.

988
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,167
Oh, you're still here. Work?

989
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,119
Yeah.

990
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,238
You, too?

991
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,988
Yup, but I just finished.

992
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:13,907
If it's taking long, I can help out.
After all, today's a half-day.

993
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,294
That's okay. I'm almost finished.

994
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:22,483
I'd better get going to practice. Later, Miyazawa.

995
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,259
Definitely weird.

996
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,911
Why is he keeping me at a distance?

998
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,964
We were getting along great until last week...

1000
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,966
Hey, Miyazawa.

1001
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,884
Want to form a study group?

1002
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,005
Our school has lots of tests, right?

1003
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,306
If we cooperate, I think we

1004
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,841
might both be able to do better.

1005
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,891
I see! That's a wonderful idea.

1006
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,560
Cooperation is such a beautiful thing!

1007
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,580
I can just see you thinking about

1008
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,730
getting good grades without working...

1010
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,250
This is just like on Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous!

1012
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's exaggerating a bit...

1013
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,711
Wow, it's so big! You're so rich!

1014
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:10,782
Father, Mother, this is
Miyazawa from my class.

1016
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:14,737
Hi, welcome.

1017
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,340
I had no idea that Souichirou
had such a darling classmate.

1019
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:21,126
Oh, surely not.

1020
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,679
I hope you and Souichirou

1021
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,579
will be friends from now on.

1022
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,431
I'll cut some cake later.

1023
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,852
Girls are so much more fun to entertain.

1024
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:32,122
Souichirou, come down 
for tea at 3 o'clock.

1026
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:33,750
Miyazawa, too, of course.

1027
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,373
Yes, Father.

1028
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,725
Your skill of feigning
innocence is really amazing.

1029
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,079
Sometimes frighteningly so.

1030
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,901
It's the result of extremely rigorous training.

1031
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:47,301
But your parents are really wonderful.

1032
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,854
Must be nice.

1033
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,643
My house is really small.  It just doesn't compare.

1034
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,143
I said to forget about my house already.

1035
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,099
I'm home!

1036
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,519
Oh, Yuki, you brought your fr...

1037
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,769
Good afternoon.

1038
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:06,789
A guy!

1040
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:13,996
What?!

1041
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,915
A guy!
*Father*

1042
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,268
I won't stand for this!

1043
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:22,239
How dare you approach my precious
princesses, you goddamn maggot!

1044
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,039
Prepare to meet your doom!

1045
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,843
Pleased to meet you.

1046
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,628
I'm Arima Souichirou.

1047
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,354
We entrust our daughter to you.

1048
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,254
What the hell are you doing?

1049
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,725
I guess Yukino really goes for looks.

1050
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,250
Or like, I don't think she
acknowledges anyone below her level.

1053
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,432
She's not that interested in
guys in the first place.

1054
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:53,136
I'm sure she sees most guys
as nothing more than paper dolls.

1056
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,739
You can say that again.
She's as cold as a demon

1057
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,573
when it comes to stuff like that.

1058
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,042
Anyway, I'm surprised
you allowed this, Dad.

1059
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Well, you see...

1060
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,180
A guy like that may never
appear in Yukino's life again.

1062
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,684
I see, a keeper, is he?

1063
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,334
Parents are such schemers.

1064
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:12,355
But I hear Aririn's family operates a big hospital.

1066
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,705
No way! For real?

1067
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:14,924
So if I tell them that

1068
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,092
my daughter is a friend of his,

1069
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,460
maybe they'll give me a discount.

1070
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,629
Right! Next time, let's all go together!

1071
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,729
But we're all perfectly healthy!

1072
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,932
Miyazawa, don't worry,
I don't mind...

1074
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,773
Why the hell does my family
have to be so DUMB?!

1076
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,500
That was so embarassing.

1077
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:36,862
But it was fun too.

1078
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,583
Up until then, he laughed a lot

1079
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,783
and was with me a lot of the time.

1080
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:45,555
But this week, he became cold all of a sudden,

1081
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,605
and barely speaks to me at all.

1082
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,341
I wonder if it's something I did.

1083
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,401
Arima.

1084
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,753
Yeah, what?

1085
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:05,006
Um, I was asked to give this to you.

1086
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,026
Thanks.

1087
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,211
This is different.

1088
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,000
This is...rejection.

1089
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,139
Why?

1090
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,841
We were friends until last week!

1091
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,510
How'd it get this way?

1092
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,179
I became afraid.

1093
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:46,764
I don't know why these things happen.

1094
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,686
I realized then for the first
time how clueless I am.

1095
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:50,986
I've always just

1096
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,139
pretended to be nice...

1097
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,959
...played the model student,

1098
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,795
and never seriously made friends with anyone...

1099
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,564
...so I have no idea what to do at a time like this.

1100
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,433
I've never spoken from my heart.

1101
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,833
I've never fought.

1102
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,637
Because I never took off my
honor student mask...

1103
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,506
...because I deceived people with it

1104
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,806
and never looked for my true self...

1105
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:16,000
. . . so now, I have nothing.

1107
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,700
So you're depressed, Sis?

1108
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,188
That's what you get for trying
seIf-criticism for the first time.

1110
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,792
You don't have immunity
to your own weaknesses...

1111
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,043
...or to the existence of a boyfriend.

1113
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:36,132
You never cared until now.

1115
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,632
Aren't you glad you found out all
this stuff since meeting Arima?

1117
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,603
That's right. I found out that

1118
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,923
I have many different sides to me.
But what about Arima?

1119
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,143
Well, we're here for you any
time you have problems,

1120
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:47,843
Sis.

1121
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,178
Except when it comes to money.

1122
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,013
That's right. I wonder what Arima does

1123
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:54,566
when he has problems.

1124
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,301
Well, unlike me he's got wonderful parents,

1125
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,904
so maybe there's nothing to be worried about.

1126
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,265
Thanks for the meal.

1127
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,584
Souichirou.

1128
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:13,502
Yes?

1129
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:16,105
The girl you brought over a while ago...

1130
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:18,555
I seem to recall her name was Miyazawa.

1131
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:22,677
Yes, she was such a composed, nice girl.

1133
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,747
That was the most enjoyable tea party

1134
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,182
we've had in a long while.

1135
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:27,082
Oh, yes.

1136
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,952
So, Souichirou, don't mind us,

1137
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,653
and bring her here again, alright?

1139
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,005
Yeah...

1140
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:42,212
What about Arima?

1141
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,734
Arima acts like any

1142
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,870
other normal high schooler sometimes.

1143
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,938
Why doesn't he show that to
anyone, except around me?

1144
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:53,138
I thought about it a lot,
and just can't figure it out.

1145
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,193
If he's not vain like me,

1146
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:57,295
why does he stay so "perfect"?

1147
00:08:58,348 --> 00:08:59,648
Isn't it tiring?

1148
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,516
Is he happy?

1149
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:07,088
Did I do something to
upset him after all?

1151
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,673
But you know...

1152
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,862
...he's probably regretting that
he told me he liked me so hastily.

1153
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,364
I'm really like this after all...

1154
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:15,965
It must've totally ruined it for him.

1155
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:23,773
Could it be that...he realized that
I secretly like him...?

1157
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:29,327
That's the most likely explanation!
And I bet he now finds that annoying or something!

1160
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,399
If so, why doesn't he just tell me?

1161
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,259
Arima...

1162
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,931
You have something you
want to say to me, right?

1163
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:48,781
Say it!

1164
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:50,867
What're you talking about?

1165
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,068
Don't play dumb!

1166
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,703
You've been ignoring me all this time!

1167
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,203
I hate that! Why don't you just tell me?

1168
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,590
It's nothing.

1169
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,111
Why're you running away?

1170
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,080
How am I supposed to
understand if you won't tell me?

1171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,780
Shut up! Leave me alone!

1172
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,566
That's my only memory of my parents.

1173
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,116
Just that little bit.

1174
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,159
Now, won't you come with me?

1175
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:14,064
That liar. He said we were friends.

1176
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:17,118
He said he liked

1177
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:18,887
me the way I am.

1178
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,433
Oh, it's no use!

1179
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,750
No use! No use! No use! No use!
I just can't figure it out!

1180
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,000
Wow. When you get to high school you
get homework that not even Sis can solve.

1183
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:44,729
I can't understand what Arima's up to,
no matter how hard I try!

1185
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,451
I can't make a guess.

1186
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,051
But I know what to do!

1187
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,253
Which means...

1188
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:54,891
I've gotta do it
according to the Code of Hamurabi

1190
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,092
An eye for an eye! A tooth for a tooth!

1191
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,326
A slight for a slight!

1192
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,928
That's it! That's my only choice!

1193
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,230
This isn't some kid's fight, you know...

1194
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,280
She's good at academics, but...

1195
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:13,909
Move it!

1196
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,062
Get your asses out of my way.

1197
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,986
Hey, Miyazawa, could you explain

1198
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,886
this translation here to me?

1199
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,025
Oh, my! From now on,

1200
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,593
would you mind asking Arima to
help with such difficult problems?

1201
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,061
It seems he's far smarter than I!

1203
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,667
Something's up with Miyazawa this morning.

1204
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,369
Yeah. Arima, did you do something to her?

1206
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:42,500
But I guess even she has bad days.

1207
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,707
So she's human too...

1209
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,664
Iron and concrete, and the sight of rain.

1210
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,901
They stir memories from deep within me.

1211
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:03,107
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

1212
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:06,377
Oh, did you wet your bed?

1213
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,864
If I answer "yes," what would they do to me?

1214
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:17,371
I bet you were scared all by yourseIf.

1215
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,343
The hand that should have slapped me,

1216
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:21,943
gently patted my head.

1217
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
My new mother

1218
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,764
changed my pajamas.

1219
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,933
My new father held me close

1220
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,685
while I fell asleep.

1221
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:34,404
Such a strange feeling...
Why am I crying so much?

1222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why does my chest hurt so much?

1223
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,428
Iron and concrete,

1224
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,497
and the sight of rain.

1225
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:45,000
They stir memories from deep within me.

1226
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,485
They give me both fear and peace,

1227
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:49,971
joy and anxiety...

1228
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,207
...along with memories of those parents.

1229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,096
And Miyazawa...What was I to her?

1230
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,720
Miyazawa?

1231
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,700
Hmph! I don't care! I'll ignore HIM this time!

1232
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,111
Hey, Miyazawa!

1233
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,440
Hmph!

1234
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,060
How pathetic! Why can't I ever be brilliant?

1235
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,730
So I'm a stupid baby who
can only deny her problems!

1237
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,580
Here. I'm no match for you.

1238
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,383
You're just so extreme.

1239
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,119
W...well excuse me! Leave me alone!

1240
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,311
Sorry, okay?

1241
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,814
He's back to normal.

1242
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:23,763
I have a past that I don't want touched.

1243
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,736
You touched it without realizing it.

1244
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,500
Your existence caused problems for me.

1246
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,308
I realized it,

1247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,078
so I tried to run away.

1248
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,813
Even though it's not your fault.

1249
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,998
I first noticed during our study
meeting when we went to your place. 

1251
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,750
I thought, "It's so different
from my place.

1252
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,337
So this is what a 
normal family is like..."

1253
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:50,124
See, I'm adopted.

1254
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:54,397
My current father is my
real father's oldest brother,

1256
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:55,347
my uncle.

1257
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,348
I really love my current parents.

1259
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,000
But I could never say or do anything I wanted,

1260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,105
Like you can in your family.

1261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
I was forced to realize that.

1262
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,260
It seems that my real parents

1263
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:11,178
were really rotten people.

1264
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:14,884
Stealing and extortion were nothing new to them.

1265
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,620
In the end, they vanished, leaving a huge debt...

1266
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,970
...and me behind.

1267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,257
I'm sure they were the shame of the family.

1268
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,292
After my parents abandoned me,

1269
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,461
the heads of the family gathered.

1270
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:27,250
I bet they thought a kid wouldn't understand.

1271
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,750
They told me to my face:

1272
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,759
That a kid born from such parents
would never amount to anything.

1273
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:32,918
So,

1274
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,838
I had to become a perfectly flawless person.

1275
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:36,788
I HAD to.

1276
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:39,075
For my own pride,

1277
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,043
and for the parents who raised me.

1278
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,500
I was satisfied with the way I was...
this person I created.

1279
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,331
Until I met you, Miyazawa.

1280
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:50,184
Why was it you?

1281
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:54,500
At first I thought I liked you
because you were just like me.

1283
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,057
But, the more I got to know you,

1284
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,043
I found myself being influenced.

1285
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,000
I really hadn't known
about that side of me.

1286
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,232
At that point,

1287
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
it occurred to me.

1288
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,372
Could it be that what I had
believed was "me" until then...

1289
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:11,073
...was merely a fake I had

1290
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,023
created through effort alone?

1291
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:15,793
Was there another "real

1292
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:17,512
me somewhere inside?

1293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,250
I thought, "This is bad."

1294
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,085
I never should have realized that.

1297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You lit up one mask after another.

1298
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:30,791
You were like the light to me...

1299
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,477
Light shining through the darkness.

1300
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,896
Just by its existence,

1301
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,431
Light clearly reveals where darkness is.

1302
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,551
The darkness inside my heart.

1303
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,287
To be honest, I resented you.

1304
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:44,940
So I tried to get away from you.

1305
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,640
Why?

1306
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,910
You found your real self, didn't you?

1307
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,712
Then why can't you be honest?

1308
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:51,247
Why do you try to hide it?

1309
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,297
What if I'm a terrible person?!

1310
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,400
If I inherited my parents' blood...

1311
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,536
I'm afraid of my blood.

1312
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,655
I can't become 
a good-for-nothing!

1313
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,000
For my father...and my mother...

1314
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,335
You really like your

1315
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,835
current parents, don't you.

1316
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,673
But, Arima...

1317
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:18,823
...as long as you keep

1318
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:22,278
stressing yourself like this,

1319
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:24,547
they'll never become your real family.

1320
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:26,449
Real families and friends love you,

1321
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,449
even if they know your faults.

1322
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,035
I love him.

1323
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,121
He wants to protect those whom

1324
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,940
he loves so much that he hurts himself.

1325
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,814
Miyazawa...

1326
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,756
What the hell did you do that for?!

1327
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:55,392
This is the real Arima.

1328
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:59,095
Don't worry. You're not a good-for-nothing.

1329
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:00,850
I like this Arima better.

1330
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,685
What did you think I was gonna do?

1331
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,285
Kiss you? Yeah, right!

1332
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:06,337
Not on your life!

1333
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:08,557
The real Arima wanted

1334
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:09,957
to come outside...

1335
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,660
He wanted to take off his mask and

1336
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,510
show his face to the world.

1337
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,463
And he found me.

1338
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:18,467
What was hiding inside you discovered

1339
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,102
what I was hiding inside me.

1340
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,852
I think that's wonderful.

1341
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,906
Have more confidence!

1342
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,356
Arima's a good guy!

1343
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:28,593
I've decided.

1344
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,746
I'm going to throw away
my model student mask.

1345
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,249
I'm going to live for
my own sake from now on.

1346
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,599
So I can like who I am.
How about you?

1347
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,469
I'm glad you're here.

1348
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,121
Me, too.

1349
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,946
And what happened to us after that?

1350
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,516
Of course, we became great friends.

1351
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:55,570
Living honestly to ourselves
has become our motto, but...

1353
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,575
M:Arima!
A:Don't hurt me!

1354
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,375
Pretending they didn't see

1355
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,280
...there's what they call public image,
and nobody wants to face reality.

1356
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
We both have to laugh at them.

1357
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,449
But I've gotten strangely
self-conscious about my love,

1358
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,470
and my heart is in turmoil.

1359
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,425
Darn, I should've taken him up on his offer

1360
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,025
when I had the chance.

1361
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,927
I guess we'll have to just
stay friends for the time being...

1362
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,566
But one day while we were talking,

1363
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,416
Arima said out of the blue:

1364
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:26,385
Oh, yeah.

1365
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,403
There's one part I really like about myself.

1366
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:34,810
You became weirder and weirder every day
but my feelings for you never changed.

1369
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,160
I've really liked you the whole time.

1370
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,190
What'll happen next!

1371
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,259
Arima again tells lucky Sis

1372
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:17,311
that he likes her.

1373
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,679
But she gets so excited that she

1374
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,283
Loses the chance to reciprocate!

1375
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,484
Will Sis finally be

1376
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:22,685
able to confess her love?!

1377
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,285
Next time on KareKano:

1378
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:25,854
Her Problem.
