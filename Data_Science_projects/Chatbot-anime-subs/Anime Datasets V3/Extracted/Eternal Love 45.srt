4
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:16,122
My Lord, Xuan Nu fled to
Yingzhou yesterday.

5
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:17,524
She has a mortal with her.

6
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:19,270
We staked out the area.

7
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,806
Once Xuan Nu poses a threat
to the princess, we'll take her down.

8
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:27,007
What are they doing in Yingzhou?

9
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,419
Are they here for the
divine fungal grass?

10
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,897
My Lord, there is another matter.

11
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:33,180
Speak.

12
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,610
Xuan Nu has the little prince
in her arms.

13
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,639
If we were to get into a fight
we might hurt the little prince.

14
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,381
Therefore, we didn't dare
to get too close to them.

15
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,787
I understand. We'll put the
little prince's safety first.

16
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:51,237
You're wrong.

17
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,092
There is no little prince.

18
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:04,014
My child was dead at birth.

19
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,311
I understand.

20
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,121
You are dismissed.

21
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,376
Yes.

22
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:18,031
<i>Xuan Nu, you've deceived me
for 70,000 years</i>

23
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,878
<i>why would you keep holding
on to that child?</i>

24
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,525
<i>I can't figure you out.</i>

25
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:54,150
Do you also think that I'm crazy
for carrying a sick child around all day?

26
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,296
No.

27
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,409
Grand Ziming Palace is a cursed place.

28
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,269
It's filled with hatred and desire.

29
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:12,868
If anyone stays there...

30
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:19,375
they will be forced to do
all sorts of harm to others.

31
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,824
And they can never redeem themselves.

32
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,156
If you didn't follow
my second brother home...

33
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:39,276
You wouldn't end up losing everything
and be filled with so much hatred.

34
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,862
Indeed.

35
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:48,956
If I hadn't gone to the Ghost Realm
with your second brother...

36
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:59,067
Do you know that I'm the youngest
daughter in my family?

37
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,338
When I was still a baby

38
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:08,685
my eldest sister married
Qing Qiu Fox King Bai Zhi's eldest son.

39
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:17,559
I kept hearing how my eldest sister
made our family proud.

40
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:25,637
It's because of my sister that
I grew up with Qing Qiu's Bai Qian.

41
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:32,444
She is the princess of Qing Qiu
the most beautiful woman of Qing Qiu.

42
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,091
But I am nothing.

43
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:49,370
Then my mother made me
marry a Black Bear Spirit.

44
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,538
I ran away to Kunlun Mountain.

45
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:59,908
Yan Zhi, I really do love
your second brother.

46
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:05,132
I stole Si Yin's sweetheart.

47
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:10,290
I took one wrong step
and it all went awry.

48
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,038
I could no longer turn back.

49
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:20,382
I gave up everything
for your second brother.

50
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,204
He thought that all I wanted was
to be the Ghost Queen.

51
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,692
But if I don't truly love him,
how would I end up like this?

52
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:22,036
Your second sister-in-law keeps holding
her sick child?

53
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:27,970
It is her child,
but it still seems quite scary.

54
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:31,660
You came all the way here with us.

55
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,439
Are you not frightened?

56
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,192
Of what?

57
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,973
I am no mortal. I'm from Ghost Tribe.

58
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,802
You're talking about that?

59
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,410
I've always liked listening
to plays since I was little.

60
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,603
The beautiful ladies of the Ghost Tribe
only exist in books.

61
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,915
Now that I've met one
why should I be scared?

62
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,802
This is Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

63
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,355
Not even deities dare to come here.

64
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,524
Yet you insisted on coming with us.

65
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,915
Aren't you afraid of getting killed?

66
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,442
I don't know a thing about
Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

67
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,708
The ignorant has nothing to fear.

68
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,740
Who knew that you could say
such wise words?

69
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,086
I'm a constable.

70
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:30,845
I would hear that from the officials.

71
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,835
I remember those words
after listening to them so often.

72
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:37,008
Go to bed now. I'll keep watch.

73
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:43,330
No, this can't be all there is to you.

74
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:51,460
Women...

75
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,918
Women always think too much.

76
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:59,134
Do you like anyone?

77
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,528
Why would you suddenly ask me so?

78
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,735
I just want to know.

79
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,529
70,000 years ago,
I guess I liked someone.

80
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,514
He was a deity and
I was still young then.

81
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,706
I just find him really cute.

82
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:21,407
But then that affection died away.

83
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,128
I don't know if that means I liked him.

84
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,919
You really do say
whatever is on your mind.

85
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,960
I have always been so.

86
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,596
It's just that in the Mortal Realm
mortals are too hard to tackle.

87
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,933
I might as well pretend to be mute.

88
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:48,015
As for me, the mortal constable
I also say whatever is on my mind.

89
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:50,797
Little mute girl.

90
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,799
I like you.

91
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,014
You...

92
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,190
You what?

93
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,725
Don't you always say
what is on your mind?

94
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,539
Why are you stammering now?

95
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,235
Do you like me?

96
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,013
- I...
- All right.

97
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,977
Don't tell me your answer
and don't fall for me.

98
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:24,062
You already knew who I am?

99
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,529
Yes, I know who you are.

100
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,365
You're Yan Zhi
the princess of the Ghost Tribe.

101
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,671
Ghost Lord's younger sister.

102
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,182
You knew it all along?

103
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:40,148
I knew it from the start.

104
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,922
Who are you?

105
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:46,245
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

106
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:51,663
Just pretend that
you know nothing for now.

107
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:59,517
Just treat me as a constable and
let me protect you on this last journey.

108
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,260
Please?

109
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,498
All right.

110
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,111
Great.

111
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,530
This is the Yan Zhi I like.

112
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,798
Go to bed. I'll be on watch.

113
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,575
The four mythical beasts
Hundun, Qiongqi, Taowu, and Taotie

114
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,586
inherited half of
Heavenly Father's powers.

115
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,519
They are very ferocious.

116
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,698
Common deities wouldn't dare
go near them.

117
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:57,317
Really? Is it that scary?

118
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,001
That's good. I'll get to meet them today.

119
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:03,042
There's a celestial shield here
that traps the four beasts in.

120
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,803
They can't get in and out freely.

121
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:08,736
However, once we get inside this cave
nothing can stop them.

122
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:12,956
Therefore... wait for me
outside the cave.

123
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,961
No matter what happens
and matter what sounds you hear

124
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,118
don't go in there.

125
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:22,514
If I don't get out before dusk
take my second sister-in-law away.

126
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:24,741
You're going in there alone?

127
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:25,861
Exactly.

128
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:28,004
I'm going in alone.

129
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:31,054
My second sister-in-law
doesn't see very well.

130
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,090
It's too dangerous to
leave her outside alone.

131
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:38,096
Constable, I'll leave
my sister-in-law to you.

132
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,748
Sister-in-law, wait here for me.

133
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:48,053
I'll get the divine fungal grass
to save your child.

134
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:00,202
Yan Zhi!

135
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,715
She's seeking her doom.

136
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,674
Listen, stay here.

137
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,822
Don't go anywhere if
you want to stay alive.

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,995
<i>No, I have to get the
divine fungal grass myself.</i>

139
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,426
Didn't I tell you to stay
outside the cave?

140
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,309
Are you joking? I'm a man.

141
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,388
How can I wait outside the cave?

142
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,976
Quickly! Take my sister-in-law away!

143
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:18,024
The four mythical beasts aren't
as easy to deal with as you think!

144
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,221
Beasts!

145
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,402
Listen up!

146
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm the 16th disciple
of Kunlun Mountain, Zi Lan!

147
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,351
As long as I'm here
don't dream of hurting anyone!

148
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,625
This is bad!

149
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,625
Yan Zhi has provoked
the four mythical beasts!

150
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,166
Protect Ghost Lord!

151
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:59,759
Yan Zhi!

152
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,144
Li Jing!

153
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,421
Escape now while
your guards are still alive!

154
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,969
Do you not know the powers
these beasts possess?

155
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,272
Even if there were ten of you
you couldn't escape from them!

156
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,335
You!

157
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,693
My Lord!

158
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,995
Is it Your Lordship?

159
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,534
You're also here for the
divine fungal grass to save our child?

160
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,172
Forget about that grass!

161
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,594
Get the women out of here!

162
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:12,385
If it weren't for your sister I would,
but I don't need you to save me!

163
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:14,862
Let's go. I'll get you both out of here.

164
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:16,049
No!

165
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,579
The divine fungal grass is here!

166
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,619
I won't leave!

167
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,276
I have to save my son!

168
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,752
I have to save my son!

169
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:23,769
Do whatever you please.

170
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,104
Try to get killed quickly.

171
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,930
It seems that no one survived.

172
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,689
Crown Prince?

173
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,106
What are you doing here?

174
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:53,968
Who disturbed the four beasts?

175
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,305
It's the Ghost Tribe.

176
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,836
They are here for
the divine fungal grass to save a child.

177
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:59,490
Ghost Tribe? Who is it?

178
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,111
Both the Ghost Lord and
Ghost Queen are in there.

179
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,224
Leave now!

180
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,431
Run!

181
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:41,525
Let's go!

182
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,098
I won't leave!

183
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,596
Why are you still here?

184
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,333
Leave now!

185
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,018
I won't leave!

186
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,498
The divine fungal grass belongs
to my son! I need to save him!

187
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,335
- You...
- I won't leave...

188
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,438
Come with me.

189
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,325
What is Your Highness going to do?

190
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,515
I am going to sink Yingzhou
of the Eastern Sea

191
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:33,834
to wipe out all traces of
the divine fungal grass.

192
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,789
Crown Prince!

193
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:14,800
Please bestow a blade of
the divine fungal grass.

194
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:20,742
You couldn't use it anyway.

195
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:22,472
It's a sacred item of
the Celestial Tribe.

196
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:26,531
I know but this child is a
half-blooded celestial tribesman.

197
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,801
I think that it might work on him.

198
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:37,057
Crown Prince, for the sake of 70,000
years of friendship between our tribes

199
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:39,740
please bestow a blade of the
divine fungal grass to that child.

200
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,421
I know that Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea
is now destroyed

201
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:48,497
and the divine fungal grass
no longer exists.

202
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:55,549
What you now hold in your hand
might be that child's last hope.

203
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:17,105
Thank you, Crown Prince!

204
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,903
Brother Li Jing, I've asked Crown Prince
for a blade of the divine fungal grass.

205
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:40,053
Try and see if it can revive your son.

206
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,759
Second Sister-in-law, she's...

207
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:05,037
You're awake?

208
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:11,223
Yes, that divine
fungal grass is for our son.

209
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,342
My Lord...

210
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,840
Don't say a word.

211
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:37,231
I'll take you to Grand Ziming Palace
and you'll get better soon.

212
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:39,531
Very soon.

213
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:47,118
Back in the cave of
Kunlun Mountain, I really...

214
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:48,448
I know...

215
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:11,443
<i>Xuan Nu, after 70,000 years</i>

216
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:17,241
<i>I've finally remembered
your true face.</i>

217
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,690
<i>What a ridiculous couple we are.</i>

218
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:27,092
<i>How pathetic.</i>

219
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,239
Brother Li Jing...

220
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:58,236
Where has the Crown Prince gone?

221
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:02,663
He went toward the valley.

222
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:31,079
Crown Prince.

223
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,662
I've given the divine fungal grass
to your sister.

224
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,564
I wonder what brings you here?

225
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,111
Crown Prince.

226
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:43,494
Could you tell me who you're going to
save with the divine fungal grass?

227
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:48,586
Since when does the Celestial Tribe have
to report to the Ghost Tribe?

228
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:52,347
I only wish to remind Your Highness

229
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:57,556
that you can use this grass
to save anyone but Mo Yuan.

230
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,965
Crown Prince, rest assured that

231
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,703
I wish not to meddle in
the affairs of the Celestial Tribe.

232
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:12,297
I only gave you such an advice
to repay your kindness

233
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:14,846
in saving my son by giving me
the divine fungal grass.

234
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,351
Why can't I save High God Mo Yuan?

235
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:26,047
70,000 years ago, Mo Yuan used his spirit
to seal up Bell of the East Emperor.

236
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,692
If he is revived 70,000 years later

237
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:33,488
the spirit that sealed up
the bell would be gone.

238
00:28:33,488 --> 00:28:38,969
Qing Cang could then
break out of the bell.

239
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,882
High God Mo Yuan
created the bell himself.

240
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:45,688
Could he not manipulate it?

241
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:50,796
Has Crown Prince ever considered
that should Qing Can become more powerful

242
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,896
how long could the bell trap him?

243
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:59,685
By then, Mo Yuan's spirit will vanish

244
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:04,528
and I dare say that it won't be long
before Qing Cang breaks out of the bell.

245
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:09,096
Since Qing Cang is trapped in the bell
how could he become more powerful?

246
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,944
My siblings and I are
Qing Cang's power vessels.

247
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:21,491
With the death of each child
Qing Cang grows more powerful.

248
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:25,215
Just a few days ago, my brother died.

249
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:33,522
Since you and A-Yin are engaged

250
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:38,223
the both of you will become
the next Heavenly Lord and Empress.

251
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:43,224
Why would you help A-Yin
revive High God Mo Yuan?

252
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,594
High God Mo Yuan is Qian Qian's mentor.

253
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:54,702
It's been Qian Qian's only wish for
the past 70,000 years to revive him.

254
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:57,384
If Qing Cang really breaks
through the bell

255
00:29:57,384 --> 00:30:02,826
will you use your own spirit to
seal up Qing Cang

256
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:06,055
for the sake of A-Yin and Mo Yuan?

257
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,623
This is all I have to say.

258
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:16,327
You now hold the last
of the divine fungal grass.

259
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:22,576
Only Your Highness could
decide what to do with it.

260
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:57,077
I'm actually...

261
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:00,019
The 16th disciple of
Kunlun Mountain's Mo Yuan, Zi Lan.

262
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:01,963
How did you know?

263
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:03,596
What did I let slip?

264
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,241
When I was knocked out
by the mythical beasts

265
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,999
I overheard you say who your mentor was.

266
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,307
That's the rule in the Celestial Realm.

267
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,217
Before we get into combat
we have to say who we are.

268
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:21,924
Otherwise, if we're defeated
no one would collect our bodies.

269
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,946
- Yan Zhi, I...
- You...

270
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:30,961
I'll be honest with you.

271
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:33,623
Back then, your second brother
barged into Kunlun Mountain

272
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:34,855
and said that he saw Si Yin

273
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:37,644
so I thought of coming to the
Mortal Realm in search of my junior.

274
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:41,551
Who knew that I'd run into you
when you were in trouble.

275
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,853
I took that chance to get close to you.

276
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,412
I wanted to stay by your side to see

277
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:49,287
what the princess of the Ghost Tribe
is really up to

278
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,977
by acting mute and running a restaurant.

279
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,028
What I am really up to?

280
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:56,757
What have you discovered?

281
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,037
Nothing.

282
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,738
I'm very stupid so I didn't
find out anything at all.

283
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,717
The fact is... I had no ulterior motive.

284
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,751
I just didn't want to stay
in Grand Ziming Palace

285
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:12,800
to witness the power struggle
and the killings.

286
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,724
I wanted to get some peace and quiet
in the Mortal Realm.

287
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,222
I see.

288
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:33,598
So... are you going to leave now that
you didn't discover any schemes?

289
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:36,825
Exactly.

290
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:43,205
If I return to the Mortal Realm again
would you come with me?

291
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,328
No.

292
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,804
I've been summoned by Kunlun Mountain.

293
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:50,118
All my seniors are already there.

294
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:53,602
So... I have to head back as well.

295
00:32:55,938 --> 00:33:02,759
Knowing that I am of the Ghost Tribe and
you're a high immortal I still asked.

296
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,171
I just don't know when to give up.

297
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,751
Yan Zhi, I...

298
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,325
I'm leaving now.

299
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,125
Don't come after me.

300
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:32,938
<i>The cranes behaved exactly like this
during the battle of Ruoshui Riverbank...</i>

301
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,563
<i>What is happening?</i>

302
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:50,320
No one is allowed to enter besides
the disciples of Kunlun Mountain!

303
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,137
Master!

304
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,722
I'm Crown Prince, Ye Hua.

305
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,934
What brings Crown Prince to
Kunlun Mountain late at night?

306
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:27,038
I'd like to borrow your elixir cauldron.

307
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,503
The elixir cauldron?

308
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,318
Sure.

309
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:35,077
Crown Prince, please come with me.

310
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:49,664
This used to be
our mentor's elixir cauldron.

311
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:51,362
I wonder if it still works.

312
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:52,684
Thank you very much.

313
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:54,733
Crown Prince, what else
could I help you with?

314
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:55,766
It's fine.

315
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:56,831
But your injuries...

316
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:59,494
It's fine. You are dismissed.

317
00:34:59,494 --> 00:35:00,610
Yes.

318
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,746
Don't tell anyone that I was here.

319
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:07,420
Rest assured, Crown Prince.
My lips are sealed.

320
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:42,621
<i>I'll retrieve the divine fungal grass
from Yingzhou</i>

321
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:46,795
<i>and then use 70,000 years of
my cultivation to create an elixir.</i>

322
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:48,034
<i>Once Die Yong takes it</i>

323
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:52,184
<i>Master should be able to wake up
within three months.</i>

324
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:44,811
<i>Qian Qian, this is the last thing
I could do for you.</i>

325
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:01,914
Seventeenth.

326
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:12,239
I just heard the maids
chatting in private

327
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,960
about your upcoming wedding with
the Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe?

328
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:20,126
I have yet to know if he's willing
to be a Heavenly Lord

329
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:21,820
without a Heavenly Empress for some time.

330
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,371
In 20,000 to 30,000 years

331
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,768
I can't withstand the sacred blaze
and holy thunderbolts.

332
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:26,889
Why is that so?

333
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't you know me well enough?

334
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,266
I didn't train well enough.

335
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:34,960
When I ascend to a high immortal

336
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,190
Master took the heavenly trial for me.

337
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,869
It was three holy thunderbolts then.

338
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,048
Now, as the Heavenly Empress

339
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:45,528
it's 81 bursts of sacred blaze
and nine holy thunderbolts.

340
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:46,836
This is no laughing matter.

341
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:49,030
You...

342
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,757
Just because you don't train well
it's even affecting your marriage now?

343
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:55,351
You really rendered me speechless.

344
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,141
You just need to stay up one more night.

345
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:04,679
Have some food to get through the night.

346
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,452
Thank you, Senior.

347
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,304
What's the matter?

348
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,737
Give this to Qian Qian.

349
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:31,115
You're going to die and
you still care about this thing?

350
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:06,623
Crown Prince of West Sea,
how are you feeling?

351
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,972
- His Highness is awake.
- His Highness is awake.

352
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:15,454
Inform Water King now.

353
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,704
- Yes.
- Yes...

354
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:30,125
I haven't felt so energetic
for 600 years.

355
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:37,181
I must head out to West Sea today
and have a swim.

356
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:42,764
I'll take a look at the scenery that
I've missed in the last 600 years.

357
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:44,264
Go ahead then.

358
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:45,626
Don't wait around any longer.

359
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:48,402
If I had slept for 600 years
like you did

360
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:50,476
I'm afraid that I wouldn't
be able to withstand it.

361
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:53,456
Emissary, you've had a hard time.

362
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,434
Get some rest now.

363
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,655
I'm going to bed.

364
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:01,615
I've been staring at this flame
day after day.

365
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:02,951
My eyes are so sore.

366
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:07,396
Please tell my senior not
to visit me.

367
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:29,429
He was fine but then
why would he end up like this?

368
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:32,094
Who knows?

369
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,925
If he could survive this
he would be able to tell us.

370
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:38,394
Are you sure that he
would tell us the truth?

371
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,414
He's so severely injured and yet instead
of returning to the Celestial Palace

372
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:44,251
he's here in my
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

373
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:46,929
He must be hiding something.

374
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,507
He doesn't want Heavenly Lord to find out

375
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:52,085
so he could only come to me for help.

376
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,164
That makes sense.

377
00:40:56,494 --> 00:40:58,340
What are you doing with that?

378
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,652
He's the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe

379
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:05,505
but now he's missing an arm.

380
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,210
How bad will that look?

381
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,333
I went and picked a 10,000-year-old
lotus root from Jade Lotus Pond

382
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,871
to make him a prosthetic arm.

383
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:15,090
Can this fake arm wield swords?

384
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,597
It can't wield swords.

385
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:17,894
It can't even move.

386
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,057
It's just for looks.

387
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:20,893
What's the point of having it then?

388
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,875
It looks nice.

389
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:29,101
Would you want him to
marry Qian Qian with one arm?

390
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:30,797
That's true.

391
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:33,065
Make it look more convincing.

392
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:35,070
It's best if no one
would notice the difference.

393
