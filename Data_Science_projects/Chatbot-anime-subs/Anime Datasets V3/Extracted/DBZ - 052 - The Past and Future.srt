1
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,838
Can I talk to Goku?

2
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:17,842
Place your hand on my
shoulder and speak.

3
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,512
Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

4
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:24,516
Yeah! I'm glad to hear
you're all doing okay.

5
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:28,186
Yeah, but the gravity here has us beat.

6
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:31,189
Our bodies are so heavy,
we can barely even run.

7
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,858
Yeah, I know, I know.

8
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:38,196
But I'm heading for a place called
Planet Namek, where they have Dragon Balls,

9
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:41,700
and I've started training under even
more incredible gravity than that.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,703
I've got to get a whole lot stronger
in the next five and a half days,

11
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,538
or we're going to be in bad shape.

12
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:49,874
<i>Huh? Why?</i>
<i>Has something happened?</i>

13
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:52,544
I was injured really bad,

14
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:57,549
so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan went to Planet
Namek to search for the Dragon Balls.

15
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:02,220
But that Saiyan, Vegeta, had also gone
to Planet Namek to find the Dragon Balls.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,158
--W- what!?
--So, did they get themselves done in by him?

17
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:12,497
No, it appears that Vegeta still ain't
discovered Kuririn and the others yet.

18
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:17,836
But that ain't all. There's
something even more unbelievable.

19
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:21,506
They said there are these other strange
guys who are after the Dragon Balls.

20
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,342
<i>The weird thing about them</i>
<i>is that they were wearing</i>

21
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:27,175
<i>the exact same outfits Vegeta was.</i>

22
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:32,851
What's more, they said that one of them
has a <i>Ki</i> that's far greater than Vegeta's.

23
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,519
W- what!?

24
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,189
What? Has something happened?

25
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,529
E- even greater than Vegeta, who was
too much for even Goku to handle?

26
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:49,200
B- by any chance,
was his name Freeza?

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,204
<i>l don't know, I ain't heard,</i>
<i>but once I know, l'll tell you.</i>

28
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,542
<i>lf it is Freeza, then this</i>
<i>is exceptionally bad...</i>

29
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:01,813
G- Goku, I'm going to check out
Planet Namek for you.

30
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,815
Could you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

31
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:07,717
Let's see, which direction
is Planet Namek in?

32
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,821
Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

33
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,166
I'm definitely sensing a tremendous <i>Ki</i>.
Now to find the source of this <i>Ki</i>...

34
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:54,199
F- Freeza!

35
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,535
<i>What, you know him, Kaio-sama?</i>

36
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:01,473
Goku, this foe is more than just too much
for you, he's the worst of the worst.

37
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,809
There is no way you can
handle this opponent.

38
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,812
Huh? W- what do you mean by that?

39
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:12,150
Listen to me, Goku. This is an
order from Kaio. Do not go near him.

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,651
When you get to Planet Namek,

41
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,155
take the other three aboard and get
out of there immediately. Got that?

42
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>l'm not just saying this</i>
<i>for your own sake.</i>

43
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,328
I'm saying this for the sake
of everyone on Earth, Namek,

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,163
and many other planets as well.

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,332
If you launch some shoddy attack
on Freeza and get him angry,

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,502
something terrible is going to happen.

47
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,172
You have to leave that guy alone.

48
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,842
Is he really that incredible a guy?
I'd kind of like to have a look.

49
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,846
Absolutely not! Do not go near him!
Do you understand me!?

50
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,680
But still...

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,013
" But still" my spongy hind end!

52
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:55,193
Goku, whatever it takes, gather the
Dragon Balls, and bring us back to life.

53
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,861
Piccolo!

54
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,465
<i>l'm going to build myself up even more</i>
<i>than you did here, and go to Planet Namek.</i>

55
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:02,133
All right!

56
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:07,472
The two of us will blow away
this ridiculous whatever-his-name-is.

57
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:12,477
Don't be absurd! You guys don't
know a thing about Freeza!

58
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:15,814
There's no time.
Hurry and start training us.

59
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:19,150
If you're planning to fight
Freeza, I cannot teach you.

60
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,813
Promise me that you won't
go to Planet Namek.

61
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:26,491
All right.

62
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:30,495
You mean it, right?
I'm trusting you.

63
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,157
That goes for you, too!

64
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:41,840
<i>There's no way l'm going to keep</i>
<i>a worthless promise like that.</i>

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,844
<i>l won't be able to surpass Goku</i>
<i>by doing the same training that he did.</i>

66
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:48,012
<i>l'll have to pick up</i>
<i>the points of the training,</i>

67
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,503
<i>and then hone the techniques on my own.</i>

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,457
All right, how about we get started?

69
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:02,126
<i>Here we go...</i>

70
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,356
<i>Let's do this...</i>

71
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:21,479
First of all...

72
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,315
...try to make me laugh with a pun.

73
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:28,149
I will allow anyone who passes
this test to train under me.

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,495
Even if he has told me not to mess with him,
there's no harm in getting stronger!

75
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:42,159
All right, let's try jumping
all the way to 50-times gravity!

76
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,845
Hey, if we keep flying at this pace,

77
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,514
how long before we arrive
at the Grand Elder's place?

78
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:00,177
We should be able to make it
in another five hours.

79
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,127
Damn, I can't find anywhere
that has multiple powers.

80
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:12,619
What does that mean?
Aren't there any more villages?

81
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:18,469
There are two powers moving.

82
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:25,143
That's strange... one of them doesn't feel
like a Namekian, or one of Freeza's men.

83
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:28,806
That's disconcerting.
Maybe I should go check it out.

84
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:37,144
<i>Meanwhile, on Kaio's World...</i>

85
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:44,495
<i>...a fierce battle of puns was unfolding.</i>

86
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:51,162
<i>Sure enough, the ones who had trouble</i>
<i>with this test were Tenshinhan and Piccolo.</i>

87
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:57,508
I am chagrined...

88
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,111
Ten-<i>san</i>, hang in there!

89
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,779
Tenshinhan...

90
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,179
(mumble mumble mumble)

91
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:09,454
And I can really make
him laugh with that?

92
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:13,124
You'll be fine. This is
my ace-in-the-hole gag.

93
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,792
It is, huh?

94
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,127
All right,

95
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,685
I'll be right back.

96
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,458
Ten-<i>san</i>, fight!

97
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:35,207
Here I go!

98
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,142
Bring it on.

99
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,887
Here goes!

100
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:53,729
Y- you think... you think...

101
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,491
You think...

102
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,108
Ten-<i>san</i>! Hang in there!

103
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,908
<i>Have faith in yourself! This one</i>
<i>is definitely going to go over well!</i>

104
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,442
Huh? What was that?

105
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,458
This is different! His determination
is different than the others up to now!

106
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,516
<i>Now!</i>

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,692
You think up your nose
is secret, but it's (s)not!!

108
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,807
You think up your nose
is secret, but it's (s)not!

109
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:43,714
You think up your nose
is secret, but it's (s)not!!

110
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,553
<i>What's that? A secret up my nose?</i>

111
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:52,717
<i>l</i>- <i>l'm not sure I understand it,</i>
<i>but in any case, it is funny, huh?</i>

112
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,728
<i>W</i>- <i>what should I do?</i>
<i>Should I laugh?</i>

113
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,840
I did it!

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,508
You did it, Tenshinhan!

115
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,843
Ten-<i>san</i>!

116
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:16,180
--You did it! You did it, Ten-<i>san</i>!
--Well done! Good for you!

117
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,171
This is nonsense!

118
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,860
Stop, Dende!

119
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,696
It's Vegeta! He's
discovered us, all right!

120
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,029
He's coming straight toward us
at incredible speed!

121
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,526
Hide! Hurry!

122
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:17,997
Huh?

123
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:23,841
W- what happened?
He changed direction.

124
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,192
There's another large <i>Ki</i> out there!
He went in that direction!

125
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:38,362
This power is Zarbon,
no doubt about it.

126
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:41,195
I've been waiting for him
to move out on his own.

127
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,210
28...

128
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,548
29...

129
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:01,882
30!

130
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:13,161
Damn... I finally made it to 30...
That's 50-times gravity for you...

131
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:27,511
Now then, to begin your
conditioning. I should warn you,

132
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,845
my conditioning is
un-" condition" -ally severe.

133
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:36,012
I just said another one!

134
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:41,848
H- huh?

135
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:49,697
You guys want to go home?

136
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:56,540
--That's funny!
--That was funny! That was funny!

137
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,203
Yeah, wasn't it though? Wasn't it though?
You can laugh even more.

138
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,147
Laugh!

139
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,707
That was great!
That was great!

140
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,151
Go ahead, laugh!

141
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,653
Okay, let's get started right away.

142
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:24,332
Hey! Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

143
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:37,515
First of all, you are going
to catch Bubbles-<i>kun</i> here.

144
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:39,517
Oh, is that it?

145
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,185
Easy, easy.

146
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:46,857
I'm not so sure. It took even
Son Goku three weeks to do it.

147
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:48,192
Goku!?

148
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,861
<i>lt took him three weeks?</i>

149
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,862
Question!

150
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:53,197
What is it?

151
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:58,202
If we catch that monkey,
will you train us, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

152
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:02,139
That's wishful thinking. After this,
you have to train with Gregory.

153
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,701
You'll train with me after
all that is done. Understood?

154
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,816
All right.

155
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,808
Okay, run, Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

156
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:19,145
--Wait up!
--Wait up!

157
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,650
Wait up! Wait up!

158
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:28,158
I'll fly.

159
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,661
Good luck!

160
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,335
Now then...

161
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,848
W- what the-!?

162
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:55,192
Is this what you call training?
This is laughable.

163
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:59,526
I don't remember giving you permission
to participate in the training!

164
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:12,800
Hmph! I don't wish to undertake any training
under you if it undermines my own dignity.

165
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,489
" Under" -take any training " under" me...
if it " under" -mines your dignity...

166
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,821
You made a triple, did you?

167
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,828
Piccolo, you passed the test.
I will train you.

168
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,170
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are
you all standing around for?

169
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,664
Laugh! Laugh! That was funny!
That was funny, right?

170
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:03,685
If only I had a Scouter,
a village would be easy to find.

171
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,933
That's... Vegeta!

172
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,479
Yo, it's been quite a long time,
hasn't it, Zarbon-<i>san</i>?

173
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:26,817
I have disposed of Dodoria.
Next, it's your turn.

174
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:27,818
What!?

175
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:32,156
Y- you disposed of Dodoria?

176
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,825
Without any trouble.

177
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,327
Unbelievable.

178
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:41,499
You'll find out once we go at it.
You'll realize how strong I am.

179
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:45,836
Vegeta, why are you turning
against Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

180
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:52,176
It's a simple matter. I've never
liked that Freeza bastard.

181
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,012
Up until now, I've been
pinned down by his power,

182
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,181
and had no choice
but to do as he said,

183
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:01,785
but then I unexpectedly learned
that I could gain eternal life.

184
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,121
You mean the Dragon Balls.

185
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:07,124
You think I'm about
to let Freeza have them?

186
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:12,796
Once I have obtained eternal life, my chance
to beat Freeza will come along for sure.

187
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:18,135
You fool. Do you think you can beat
Freeza-<i>sama</i> with just eternal life?

188
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,804
It's too bad you don't have a Scouter.

189
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:27,478
I have gained more power than you
could imagine over my many battles.

190
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:30,147
<i>You're</i> the one who doesn't understand.

191
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:35,819
Freeza-<i>sama</i>'s ability
far transcends even your level.

192
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,656
I'm through with all of this pointless talk!

193
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:43,494
I heard from Dodoria that
Freeza is afraid of Saiyans.

194
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:48,165
I'm going to show you that
Saiyan power, right now!

195
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,167
You really are full of yourself.

196
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,171
What Freeza-<i>sama</i> was afraid of
was the Saiyans banding together.

197
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,507
You can't do anything all by yourself.

198
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,840
Well, let's see about that.

199
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,209
He deflected it!

200
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,560
Incredible! It's a clash
of <i>Ki</i> against <i>Ki</i>!

201
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,163
Vegeta and someone else
are banging into each other!

202
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:57,167
H- his opponent is probably the one
who was at that Freeza guy's side.

203
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:01,772
T- they're both monsters. There's no way
I can square off against them.

204
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:06,443
I hope the two of them
end up flattening each other.

205
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,445
All right...

206
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,447
Hold on to me tight!

207
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:11,849
This is our chance!

208
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,119
We'll hurry to the Grand Elder while
the two of them are fighting each other!

209
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,351
If I fly as fast as I can, we'll
get there a lot sooner! Let's go!

210
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,462
What's the matter!?

211
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:29,466
Zarbon-<i>sama</i>, of all people! Your movements
make you look like you're standing still!

212
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:30,865
Damn it!

213
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,222
To think that you'd be
so helpless at <i>this</i> level!

214
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:19,350
You've surprised me. You have
indeed made magnificent progress.

215
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,185
But as a result,

216
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:27,858
you have awakened my true power,
which has been dormant for many years.

217
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:32,196
<i>Zarbon's expression</i>
<i>has suddenly changed.</i>

218
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:38,533
<i>Exactly what is this hidden,</i>
<i>fearsome power of his?</i>

219
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:49,533
