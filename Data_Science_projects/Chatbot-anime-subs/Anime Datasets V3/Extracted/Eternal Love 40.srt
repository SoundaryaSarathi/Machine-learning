<i>[Episode 40]</i>

3
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,783
Xiwu Palace is so large.

4
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:34,984
Will you be able to find
the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

5
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:39,544
I probably can.

6
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:40,943
I'll walk you.

7
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,183
Your Highness.

8
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,864
Your Highness!

9
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:08,663
Please beg His Highness.

10
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:11,424
It was Your Highness who
told me to do this.

11
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:13,463
Your Highness.

12
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:19,544
You're saying I made you do it?

13
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:30,704
Miao Qing.

14
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:33,984
I had taken pity on you because of
your infatuation with His Highness.

15
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,743
Yet, you are going to use this
to accuse me of an injustice?

16
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:40,783
Your Highness, that is not what I meant!

17
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:45,144
I had misjudged you.

18
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:49,864
Your Highness, I spoke irresponsibly!
Please forgive me!

19
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:59,704
Since His Highness has asked you
to leave, you should not delay.

20
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,223
Leave now.

21
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,623
Your Highness...

22
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:36,863
Your Highness!

23
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:39,704
Are you all right, Your Highness?
Did it go well?

24
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,223
Xin Nu.

25
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:48,584
I finally know why Ye Hua...

26
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:52,144
is so attached to her.

27
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,944
Your Highness, what are you saying?

28
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,723
Just now...

29
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,144
Just now, I saw Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

30
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:06,983
Do you know who she looks like?

31
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:15,064
She actually looks
no different from that mortal.

32
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,423
Your Highness.

33
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:21,463
What are you saying?

34
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,944
Su Su.

35
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:30,384
It's Su Su!

36
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,824
She and Su Su...

37
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:38,663
actually look so much alike...

38
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,783
Your Highness.

39
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:58,624
Here is fine. I know the way from here.

40
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,384
Really, I can find my way from here.

41
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:12,504
I escorted you all this way
not just to lead the way for you.

42
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,903
I wanted to ask you a question.

43
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:20,264
Why did you tell the princess
to return to the Eastern Sea?

44
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:25,744
Didn't you want her to return
to the Eastern Sea as well?

45
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,543
Is that the only reason?

46
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:35,343
I don't know how to answer you
now that you ask me that.

47
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,663
As I expected.

48
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,303
What did you expect?

49
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,184
I didn't forget my promise to you.

50
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,903
I will remember to find
a few consorts for you.

51
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:53,504
But since you don't like that princess

52
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:56,663
then just send her back
to the Eastern Sea.

53
00:06:56,663 --> 00:07:00,223
Speaking of which, the princess
was a bit too calculating.

54
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,223
She tried to drug you today.

55
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:06,223
Who knows what she might do another day?

56
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,903
It's better for the palace to be
more peaceful and quiet.

57
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:11,343
What do you think?

58
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,343
I shouldn't have asked you this question.

59
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:20,423
I asked you to go into the room
because I wanted you to be jealous.

60
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:27,303
But I didn't realize that you
were just putting on a show.

61
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,343
In your heart...

62
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,863
I have no standing.

63
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,064
Bai Qian.

64
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,783
Does your heart only have room
for one person?

65
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:49,824
How long will you wait for him?

66
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,744
<i>In your heart, I have no standing.</i>

67
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,184
<i>Bai Qian, does your heart
only have room for one person?</i>

68
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,463
<i>How long will you wait for him?</i>

69
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,144
<i>I was so sleepy earlier.</i>

70
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:36,543
<i>Now that I'm lying under
this soft blanket, I can't sleep.</i>

71
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:45,624
In your heart, I have no standing.

72
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,864
Bai Qian.

73
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,823
Does your heart only have room
for one person?

74
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:20,984
<i>A-Yin.</i>

75
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,543
<i>A-Yin, where are you?</i>

76
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,943
<i>A-Yin.</i>

77
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,183
<i>A-Yin.</i>

78
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>In this lifetime, I, Li Jing,
will only be with A-Yin.</i>

79
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,024
If I break this oath

80
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,384
I shall have no posterity,
and live a life of loneliness.

81
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:29,423
<i>Back then, you said</i>

82
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,464
regardless of who I am...

83
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:35,063
you would be with me.

84
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,384
But now?

85
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,543
Very well.

86
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,823
I'll let you two be.

87
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,303
<i>Li Jing.</i>

88
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:49,224
You are indeed the only man
that I wholeheartedly loved

89
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,528
in all my 140,000 years.

90
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:54,504
It's just that too much time has passed.

91
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:56,943
We cannot return to the way we were.

92
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:24,823
<i>I mustn't die.
Millions of people still depend on me.</i>

93
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,464
Your Majesty!

94
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,744
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

95
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,744
Report!

96
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,563
Xuan Nu escaped from
the dungeons last night!

97
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,703
Before she left, she killed Li Yuan
by stabbing him in the heart!

98
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,543
What did you say? My brother is dead?

99
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,943
Yes!

100
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,144
Cut his head off.

101
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:27,384
Hang it outside Grand Ziming Palace
in public view for seven days.

102
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,504
Burn the body.

103
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:33,943
He was the former Ghost Lord's
eldest son

104
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:36,104
and your older brother.

105
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:40,024
If word spreads, I'm afraid
the generals will be displeased.

106
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,703
The people will criticize you as well.

107
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,875
His death will bring
great a catastrophe to the Ghost Realm

108
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,464
and the rest of the world.

109
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,224
Doing this...

110
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:57,183
is already the most merciful way
of handling him.

111
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,464
Quickly, send men to
track down the princess.

112
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,344
She must be brought back
to the Ghost Realm.

113
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,864
If they come across Xuan Nu...

114
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:15,464
No need to report to me.
Just kill her on the spot.

115
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,663
Bring her corpse back to the Ghost Realm.

116
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:24,264
She was the woman that I
officially wed into Grand Ziming Palace.

117
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,943
After I die...

118
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,864
I want to be buried with her.

119
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,264
- Yes.
- Yes.

120
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,024
<i>They've flown away!</i>

121
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,903
<i>No, I must find Yan Zhi quickly.</i>

122
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,144
<i>I must find her quickly.</i>

123
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,024
<i>[Linhe Dining]</i>

124
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:29,264
Linhe Dining! Meat and wine at
fair prices! Equal treatment to all!

125
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:31,264
Don't pass us by!

126
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:35,224
Sir, have you eaten yet?

127
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,464
Come on inside.

128
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,583
Sir, have you eaten yet?

129
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,504
- Come on inside.
- All right.

130
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:52,063
<i>The jade is burning hotter.
Yan Zhi must be nearby.</i>

131
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,984
Madam, you...

132
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:06,703
Have you eaten yet?

133
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:10,024
Sir, is there a lady nearby?

134
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,823
Very beautiful, very fair,
with large eyes?

135
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,624
She's about the same height
and build as me.

136
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,224
<i>This woman is looking for Yan Zhi?</i>

137
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:21,264
Why aren't you speaking?

138
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:22,984
Is there not a lady like that?

139
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:26,823
Madam, what is wrong with your eyes?

140
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,464
Do you need to find a physician?

141
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:32,783
My eyes were injured by villains.

142
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:36,984
Sir, tell me quickly.
Is there such a lady nearby?

143
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,543
There is a lady who
fits your description.

144
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:41,104
She is in this restaurant.

145
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:42,744
Take me to her!

146
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,063
All right.

147
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,543
Watch your step.

148
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,864
Madam, wait here.

149
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,303
All right.

150
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,984
Take a look. She was searching for you.

151
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:42,183
<i>The jade is suddenly very hot.</i>

152
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,624
<i>Yes, Li Yuan was right.</i>

153
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:48,583
<i>This is Yan Zhi in front of me.
It's Yan Zhi!</i>

154
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,783
Yan Zhi! Yan Zhi!

155
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,744
I am Xuan Nu. Xuan Nu!

156
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:55,504
<i>Xuan Nu? She is Xuan Nu?</i>

157
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:58,663
<i>It can't be.
Xuan Nu doesn't look like this.</i>

158
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:04,023
Sister-in-law?
Why do you look like this?

159
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,304
I know my face has changed.

160
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:16,183
It was Bai Qian.
She took away my beauty.

161
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:22,663
Yan Zhi, do I look really ugly
like this? Do I?

162
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:26,983
No, Sister-in-law, you don't.
Don't be afraid.

163
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,943
Little Mute!
You can actually speak?

164
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,864
Yes, I can speak.

165
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,943
I don't have time to explain.

166
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:41,463
Can you go out to the main hall
and attend to the guests for me?

167
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:42,903
All right.

168
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,943
I happen to be free today.

169
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,983
You can take your time talking.
There is no hurry.

170
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,864
Oh...

171
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:58,463
If your sister-in-law needs a physician,
let me know.

172
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:01,544
I will call for you if I need you. Go on.

173
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,784
Yan Zhi, who was that man?

174
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:13,183
Is it someone you brought
from the Ghost Realm?

175
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:16,463
No, I didn't take anyone with me
when I left the Ghost Realm.

176
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:20,824
Don't worry.
He is just an ordinary mortal.

177
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,503
He has been taking care of me
for the past few years.

178
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,304
Taking care of you?

179
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:32,023
Is this child yours?

180
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,463
It is my son.

181
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,703
A prince? Let me see!

182
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:46,263
Good, good boy.

183
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,703
<i>Why aren't there any signs of life?</i>

184
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,183
<i>It's really not breathing!</i>

185
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,903
Doesn't my son look a lot like me?

186
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,263
Yes.

187
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:19,903
I raised him myself
from the moment he was born.

188
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,023
It's been 300 years.

189
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:25,824
He doesn't cry or throw tantrums.
He's very obedient.

190
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,503
Yan Zhi, isn't he a good boy?

191
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,824
Yes.

192
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:41,503
<i>How could a mother not know
whether her child is a boy or a girl?</i>

193
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:46,064
<i>It hasn't grown or cried for 300 years.</i>

194
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,001
<i>From the moment it was born,
it was clearly...</i>

195
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:52,624
<i>She must not have been able to accept it.</i>

196
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,943
<i>That's why...</i>

197
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,824
Sister-in-law.

198
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:03,223
Have you also noticed he doesn't cry,
doesn't make noise, and doesn't breathe?

199
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,023
He is just asleep.

200
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:10,344
Yan Zhi, trust me.

201
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:15,503
Once I find a way,
he will surely wake up.

202
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:19,183
My son will definitely wake up.

203
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>I've been following
the Ghost Realm princess for three years.</i>

204
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,943
<i>There haven't been any leads.</i>

205
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:38,023
<i>Now Xuan Nu appears with a different face
and cuts all over her body.</i>

206
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,824
<i>It seems there hasn't been peace
in the Ghost Realm for the years.</i>

207
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:44,423
<i>Perhaps I might discover something
if I stay here.</i>

208
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:52,344
<i>Wait! What if Yan Zhi heals
Xuan Nu's eyes?</i>

209
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:56,384
<i>Xuan Nu will recognize me.
I can't let her see my face.</i>

210
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:47,104
Sister-in-law, try now.
Can you see clearly?

211
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,864
No, everything's still a blur.

212
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,503
That's odd.

213
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:08,263
This is clearly just a normal wound.
Why doesn't it heal?

214
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,384
It's all right.

215
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:24,263
I don't want to see
this fake face anyway.

216
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:25,864
It's too hideous.

217
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:30,743
Sister-in-law, don't fear.
I will try something else another day.

218
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,463
Your eyes will be healed eventually.

219
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:38,223
Tell me what happened first.
What happened to you?

220
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:10,624
<i>Li Jing killed Li Yuan</i>

221
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,983
<i>and hung his head
outside Grand Ziming Palace</i>

222
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,983
<i>for public viewing for days.</i>

223
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:18,304
<i>The body was burned to ash.</i>

224
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:20,344
<i>I tried to persuade him</i>

225
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:22,503
<i>but Li Jing flew into a fury.</i>

226
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:25,064
<i>He yelled at me for
giving birth to a sick child</i>

227
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:27,663
<i>causing him to have no progeny.</i>

228
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:31,023
<i>Then he wounded my eyes.</i>

229
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:35,624
<i>He drove me and my child
out of the Ghost Realm.</i>

230
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:50,663
You... Why are you crying?

231
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:56,544
There has been misfortune in the family.

232
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,344
My eldest brother is dead.

233
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,104
<i>Li Yuan is dead?</i>

234
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:08,344
That's... Death is
a natural part of life.

235
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:11,743
Don't be too upset.

236
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:25,183
I didn't speak all those years...

237
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:29,304
because I didn't want to
have to deal with others.

238
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:35,183
I really didn't deceive you on purpose.

239
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:39,824
It's all right. It's fine.

240
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:52,624
Thank you for taking care of me
for all those years.

241
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,703
It was... It was nothing.

242
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:03,304
I just remembered I have
things to do at the bureau today.

243
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:04,624
I have to leave.

244
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:08,183
Weren't you free today?

245
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:11,983
I... I forgot.

246
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:30,943
There is unrest among the people.

247
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:35,023
There has been a rumor that
the former Ghost Lord will be returning.

248
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,023
Is that true?

249
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:40,743
Hasn't the former Ghost Lord been
sealed away by Mo Yuan at Ruoshui?

250
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:43,463
There was activity at Ruoshui
a few days ago. That was a sign.

251
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:47,344
If the former Ghost Lord were to escape

252
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:48,824
then with his temper

253
00:25:48,824 --> 00:25:51,463
he would definitely fight to the death
with the Celestial Tribe.

254
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:54,703
How many people will die this time?

255
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,384
I'd rather have corpses litter the ground

256
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,585
than continue offering tribute to
the Celestial Tribe.

257
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:45,223
What spell has His Majesty fallen under?

258
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:47,463
Not only does His Majesty
only favor Pure Consort Chen

259
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:50,703
he even decreed the harem selection
is to be put on hold for five years.

260
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:55,663
Ever since Noble Consort joined
the Taoist temple 15 years ago

261
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:59,263
no other concubines have
given birth to a child.

262
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:03,624
I thought His Majesty would surely
pass the throne to the Crown Prince

263
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,423
but there is now
a Pure Consort in the picture

264
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:07,864
who is so heavily favored.

265
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:10,423
Should she be so lucky as to
give birth to a prince

266
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:13,344
then there is no guarantee
who the throne will belong to.

267
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:41,144
<i>Decades in the Mortal Realm
flash by in an instant.</i>

268
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,384
<i>When Dijun returns to the Nine Heavens</i>

269
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,983
<i>will he blame me for
altering his original trial of love?</i>

270
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:50,983
<i>But I can't bear to hurt him,
even if it is a trial he must experience.</i>

271
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:53,144
<i>You must even if you can't bear to.</i>

272
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:08,544
Why are you so ill at ease
every time you come to see me?

273
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:12,463
I was just clumsy.

274
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:16,064
Your Majesty, do not walk around.
I'll have someone clean this up.

275
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,983
What? You want me to create difficulties
for the Noble Consort?

276
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:29,983
Yes.

277
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:32,223
Do what you can to
win her favor out of jealousy.

278
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:35,864
Haven't I given you many storybooks?
There are many methods written in them.

279
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:39,503
The Noble Consort has been living in
the Taoist temple for so long.

280
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:41,503
What is there to be jealous of?

281
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,344
Her son was conferred
the title of Crown Prince.

282
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:49,183
Just that point is enough to
cause envy in all the women in the harem.

283
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:53,144
You have been favored for so long
but haven't had a son.

284
00:28:53,144 --> 00:28:55,743
Do you not harbor any hatred?

285
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,384
I don't.

286
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,864
Have you ever experienced
the taste of jealousy?

287
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:07,503
I only think of being able to
have this short time with Dijun.

288
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:10,503
I don't have the time to be jealous.

289
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:12,903
You truly are suited to follow Dijun.

290
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:15,304
Really?

291
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:18,703
Just to follow.
You're not destined to be together.

292
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:24,463
I know I hold no place in Dijun's heart.

293
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,183
But can you let me have
this beautiful dream?

294
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,703
I have to shatter your beautiful dream.

295
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,223
Bear this in mind.

296
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:35,864
You must make Dijun hate women
and be thoroughly disappointed.

297
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:40,503
Only then will your trip here
be successful.

298
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:42,023
Does it have to be like this?

299
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:43,423
It does.

300
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:49,384
What is that?

301
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,544
The newest story.

302
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:54,624
Fighting among the harem for favor.
The Noble Consort is framed.

303
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,943
Act according to what is written.

304
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:06,864
<i>[The Hall of Three Purities]</i>

305
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,023
Your Highness.

306
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:24,703
I should be the one to greet you, Sister.

307
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,263
I am no longer the Noble Consort.
There's no need to salute me.

308
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:31,784
Sister, before I was
favored by His Majesty

309
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:35,544
I was living in the Cold Palace
and often heard stories about you.

310
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:38,983
I finally get to meet you, a legend.

311
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,943
I am merely no longer
disillusioned with human society

312
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,463
and have devoted myself to Taoism.

313
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,223
Your Highness speaks too highly of me.

314
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:49,624
This is our first time meeting.
Let's not be so courteous.

315
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:54,023
By the way, I heard the temple
has some of the palace's best tea.

316
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:56,903
May I have a drink?

317
00:30:56,903 --> 00:31:00,223
All right. Your Highness,
please have a seat.

318
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:13,703
Your Majesty, the Pure Consort has been
having stomach pains for an hour

319
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:16,263
and has fainted several times now.

320
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:17,703
Why would this happen?

321
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:22,344
The imperial physician said
she ate something unclean.

322
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:24,503
Something unclean?

323
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:30,423
I heard the Pure Consort visited
the Noble Consort's Taoist temple

324
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:31,824
and had some refreshments.

325
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,584
She was this way after she returned.

326
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:36,463
- She went to the Taoist temple?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

327
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:46,263
Didn't I say not to allow the
Pure Consort to go to the Taoist temple?

328
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:51,624
Your Majesty, nobody but you
can stop the Pure Consort.

329
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:54,104
Your Majesty, you had best
hurry to take a look.

330
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:57,864
She is vomiting and fainting.
What should we do?

331
00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:01,023
It... Could it have been...

332
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,344
Could have been what?

333
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:07,463
Could it have been
that the Noble Consort was afraid

334
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:08,844
the Pure Consort would bear a son

335
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,344
and steal the title of Crown Prince

336
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,223
so she drugged the refreshments?

337
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,503
Atrocious!

338
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:17,020
How can you vilify
the Crown Prince's mother in such a way?

339
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,864
I am wrong! I am wrong!

340
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,263
In any case, she gave birth
to the Crown Prince.

341
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,299
You must not make
such presumptuous guesses.

342
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,503
Yes, yes.

343
00:32:27,743 --> 00:32:30,223
Come with me to see the Pure Consort.

344
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:50,304
This is such an insidious plot line.

345
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:55,615
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty.</i>

346
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,903
Your Majesty.

347
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:23,223
Here.

348
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:31,544
What is causing your sudden
stomach pains?

349
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,263
And you are sweating so much.

350
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:38,983
I heard you went to
the Noble Consort's Taoist temple.

351
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:42,824
I did go.

352
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,104
<i>Ever since I was young,
Aunt taught me</i>

353
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,463
<i>to be worthy of my identity
as a princess of Qing Qiu.</i>

354
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:50,064
<i>How can I act like a raving lunatic</i>

355
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:53,463
<i>and cause harm to such a benevolent woman
who is devoted to Taoism?</i>

356
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:55,703
Jiu'er?

357
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,064
<i>No, no.</i>

358
00:33:57,064 --> 00:34:00,144
<i>Doing this would be too much of
a disappointment to Aunt.</i>

359
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:02,584
<i>I must change the plan.</i>

360
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,544
I did go to the temple.

361
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:15,384
But this has nothing to do
with the Noble Consort.

362
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,224
Do not imagine things, Your Majesty.

363
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:21,463
I secretly played in the water
a few days ago and caught a cold.

364
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:24,184
It has nothing to do
with the Noble Consort.

365
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:27,983
Of course I would not blame her.

366
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,184
I understand very well
the sort of person the Noble Consort is.

367
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:36,344
But you did not treasure your own body.

368
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,384
Have you considered my feelings?

369
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:45,943
I was too mischievous.
I've caused Your Majesty to worry.

370
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:54,983
Jiu'er.

371
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:02,864
I was very afraid you were going to say
it was the Noble Consort who harmed you.

372
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:07,983
Since you had that speculation

373
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:12,784
if I really had said that,
would Your Majesty have believed me?

374
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:17,824
No.

375
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:25,583
Yes, I'd forgotten.

376
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,503
When I was still an Honored Lady

377
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:30,264
Your Majesty had come to
speak of your grievances

378
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,864
because of the heartbreak
the Noble Consort caused you.

379
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,344
You would surely trust her and not me.

380
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:42,983
I believe both of you.

381
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:45,463
The Noble Consort has long since
abandoned human society

382
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:46,664
and you...

383
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:50,224
are the one I love the most.

384
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:52,864
You have a pure and kind disposition.

385
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:54,983
You would never harm her.

386
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,943
I was very anxious on my way here.

387
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:03,463
I clearly knew that with
the Noble Consort's character

388
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,248
she would never do such a thing.

389
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:10,103
However, I could imagine

390
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,664
if anything were to happen to you

391
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:16,264
I would never forgive
anyone in the Taoist temple.

392
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:23,063
It seems I could be a fatuous ruler.

393
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,423
Is Your Majesty speaking the truth?

394
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,664
The absolute truth.

395
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:37,664
Jiu'er.

396
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:43,704
If anything were to happen to you,
I would lose all reason.

397
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,784
Then...

398
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:51,463
What if I were to do wrong one day?

399
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:57,143
No matter what you do, I will pardon you.

400
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,143
Give me another two years.

401
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,983
After two years, I will do
those things to betray him.

402
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,023
Your Highness.

403
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:21,864
You must not continue living this life
so willfully just because you know me.

404
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,623
Dijun is an immortal who has
lived hundreds of millennia.

405
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:28,023
Will he really remember this
relationship that only lasts a few days?

406
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:30,023
What does it matter that
it is just a few days?

407
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,164
I will take as many as I can.

408
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:36,023
All right.

409
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:41,224
Then two years will be the limit.
I will appear again when the time comes.

410
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:05,864
Your Majesty.

411
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,704
It's so late. Why are you here?

412
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:16,224
I made some desserts.

413
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,784
I'd like to look at the moon
with Your Majesty.

414
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:20,784
Look at the moon?

415
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:29,664
Didn't you say you haven't been
feeling well lately?

416
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:31,744
Have you forgotten
what the physician said?

417
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:35,344
That is why I came here in secret.
The physician does not know.

418
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:41,543
Jiu'er, you seem different today.

419
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:44,824
Do I? How am I different?

420
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,943
In the past year, I have felt
there has been something on your mind.

421
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,063
But tonight, I feel

422
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:58,543
you have already let go of
whatever was troubling you

423
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:02,184
and are finally willing to be
open with me.

424
00:39:03,864 --> 00:39:07,463
I understand it now.
Life is short.

425
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:09,224
Since I love Your Majesty

426
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,864
I should put my whole heart into
treating Your Majesty well.

427
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:16,023
Otherwise, I will surely regret it
when I think back on it later.

428
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:18,824
Is that true?

429
00:39:20,784 --> 00:39:24,704
Since you have thought things through,
then come here.

430
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:35,623
Your Majesty, you must promise me

431
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,304
that no matter what,
you must not forget these two years.

432
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:42,784
I promise you.

433
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:17,304
<i>Yan Zhi, do not blame me
for being heartless.</i>

434
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:21,583
<i>Only by killing you
can your father's powers increase</i>

435
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:24,063
<i>so he can break out of
the Bell of the East Emperor's seal.</i>

436
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:28,664
<i>Only your father will kill
all of Qing Qiu for me</i>

437
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:30,304
<i>to get revenge for me.</i>

438
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,983
Who are you?
Are you from the Ghost Tribe?

439
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:06,103
You still don't recognize my voice?

440
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,304
Are you Zi Lan?

441
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:16,423
That's right. It's me.

442
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,344
Why are you here?

443
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:24,224
If I weren't here, you would have already
killed Yan Zhi after she saved you.

444
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,344
Xuan Nu, even after
more than 70,000 years

445
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,744
you are still such an ungrateful person!

446
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:31,744
My business has nothing to do with you!

447
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:36,063
On the other hand, have you
forgotten how your master died?

448
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:40,023
Have you forgotten the enmity between
Kunlun Mountain and Grand Ziming Palace?

449
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:42,384
You are actually protecting
the Ghost Tribe's princess?

450
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:44,744
Aren't you afraid of being
struck by lightning?

451
00:41:44,744 --> 00:41:48,664
You don't need to worry about me,
traitor of the Celestial Tribe!

452
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:51,344
I don't know why you want to kill Yan Zhi

453
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:54,784
but I'll tell you that
as long as I am here

454
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:57,744
if you dare to have this notion again

455
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:01,304
you will know the consequences of
your betrayal to the Celestial Tribe!

456
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,864
I am not doing anything to you now

457
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:10,744
because I see that you have
lost your status and rank

458
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,664
and have a child in tow.

459
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,583
That is why I am showing you
some compassion.

460
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,463
Do not force my hand.

461
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:21,143
If you stay by Yan Zhi's side
without harming her, I will not hurt you.

462
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:24,184
Do you understand?

463
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,224
Yes.

464
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:44,684
