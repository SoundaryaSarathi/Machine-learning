1
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:36,454
What a gentle hand…

2
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,819
This hand…

3
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:48,059
[Sakura’s Dizzy Fever Day]

4
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,250
Sakura! It’s morning’!

5
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:08,482
It’s raining’ today.

6
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:12,187
You can’t skate in the rain,
so hurry up…

7
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:20,590
What’s wrong…

8
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:23,228
I feel kinda dizzy…

9
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:24,539
Dizzy?

10
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,305
You got a real bad fever!
You okay?

11
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:33,578
It’s better to skip school
if you’re sick.

12
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,843
There’s a poster I haven’t finished,

13
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,177
and it’s due today.

14
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,949
I left it at school so I have to…

15
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,217
Hey, hey!

16
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:45,157
Thanks…

17
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:53,596
Good morning.

18
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:55,598
You overslept again?

19
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,767
Our monster’s sure at a loss
on a rainy day.

20
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:00,964
That’s not it.

21
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,676
Good morning, Mother.

22
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:09,674
What’s wrong?

23
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,084
You’re very warm.

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,654
Don’t tell Father I have a fever.

25
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,187
Why not?

26
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:21,825
Father is going out of town, right?

27
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:23,525
The long-waited excavation
has finally succeeded.

28
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,993
He was looking forward to it.

29
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,435
If he finds out I’m sick,

30
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,231
he might not go…

31
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:38,768
Good morning.

32
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:40,240
Good morning!

33
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,416
Good morning, Nadeshiko-san.

34
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:48,180
It’s raining today.

35
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:50,950
Yeah, but I heard the
excavation site is sunny today.

36
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:52,256
Thank goodness!

37
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,655
Let’s eat!

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,604
I’ll be back next Saturday.

39
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,804
Okay. Good luck!

40
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,699
Then, I’ll see you later.

41
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:09,741
Bye!

42
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:10,839
Take care.

43
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:23,891
Just skip school today.

44
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,690
If I skip, I’ll make everyone worry.

45
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:28,622
But…

46
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:31,195
I’ll come straight home

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,332
and go to bed right away.

48
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,436
Now, let’s go, Touya.
We’re going to be late!

49
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,447
Sakura-chan.

50
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,418
You are not feeling well today?

51
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,517
No… Not at all.

52
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,924
But you don’t seem cheerful.

53
00:03:58,894 --> 00:03:59,792
I’m fine!

54
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:01,356
Really?

55
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:02,491
That’s good.

56
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:10,368
Good morning!

57
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,731
Good morning.

58
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,438
Good morning, Tomoyo.

59
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,147
You don’t look so well.

60
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:24,976
Are you okay, Sakura?

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,381
I feel kinda dizzy…

62
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,821
You should have
just skipped school today.

63
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:33,417
I’m fine. I’ll be okay.

64
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:21,206
You have a fever, don’t you?

65
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:22,374
I am okay!

66
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:23,600
Maybe you’ve caught a cold…

67
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:25,878
Daidouji-san,

68
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,772
could you take Kinomoto-san
to the school nurse?

69
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:29,811
Yes.

70
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,982
I… I’m okay, Tomoyo-chan…

71
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,015
Now, let’s go.

72
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,475
Let me see.

73
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:08,484
It’s pretty high.

74
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:11,515
She did get a cold after all.

75
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,324
The fourth period has already gone by.

76
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:15,552
I suggest you skip the rest of the day.

77
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,591
But the poster…

78
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,501
We will finish it somehow.

79
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:23,732
But…

80
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:24,870
Don’t worry!

81
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:28,899
Mei Lin-chan! Li-kun!

82
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,844
I’m here! I’ll finish it for sure!

83
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,379
But…

84
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,618
Look, you don’t trust me?

85
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:39,518
That’s not it! But…

86
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,584
Then don’t say, “but…”

87
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,021
Shao Lan, Daidouji-san,

88
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,521
and I will finish it for sure.

89
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:48,362
And of course, in its best form!

90
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,119
Right, Daidouji-san?

91
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,896
Please do not worry about it,
and just leave it to us!

92
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:56,095
Right, Shao Lan?

93
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,136
So, hurry up and go home.

94
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,473
Thanks.

95
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,400
I’m glad you came.

96
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,301
You called me.

97
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,441
Within your mind.

98
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:38,873
It’s not something I usually hear.

99
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,971
It’s about Sakura-chan.

100
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,341
She…

101
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:43,943
It seems she has a cold after all.

102
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:45,981
So, take her home, okay?

103
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,712
She has already started
packing up to go home.

104
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,290
Kaho!

105
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:54,789
Why did you come back?

106
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,959
Because, there are certain
little things I need to do.

107
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:12,572
I am worried about you.

108
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:14,107
Let me walk you home.

109
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,949
It’s okay.
I can go home on my own.

110
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:20,485
Sakura-chan!

111
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,347
Such thick clouds…

112
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:24,482
Sakura…

113
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:28,887
Thanks.

114
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,156
Sorry to have you

115
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,688
bring my schoolbag here.

116
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,221
It’s okay. I hope Sakura’s
temperature goes down quickly.

117
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,223
But you know, Mizuki-sensei

118
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:41,390
Is quite a mysterious person.

119
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,894
I was so surprised

120
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:45,272
when you suddenly jumped
out of the classroom.

121
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:48,397
You could hear
Mizuki-sensei’s voice, right?

122
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,441
Even though she wasn’t nearby.

123
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,972
Not normally.

124
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:54,281
Today’s special.

125
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,414
Because it’s about Sakura, right?

126
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:07,088
If you need me for anything,

127
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,058
give me a call.

128
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,092
I’ll be right over.

129
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:10,589
See ya.

130
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,335
Sakura…

131
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:28,545
Take your temperature.

132
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:00,441
How’s it?

133
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:01,839
Here.

134
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,015
It’s not going down at all.

135
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,246
You already took the medicine but it
still doesn’t go down for some reason…

136
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:09,921
I’ll be right back.

137
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,363
Your brother probably
noticed me after all.

138
00:11:58,773 --> 00:11:59,637
What’s wrong?

139
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:02,068
I sense a Clow Card.

140
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,304
You’re right…

141
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:09,049
You can’t get up!

142
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,478
Th… This is…!

143
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:19,660
A Clow Card?

144
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:21,852
Cloud. The card of the clouds.

145
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,498
Sakura! What are you doing?!

146
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:27,223
I gotta seal it…

147
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,235
If you go out in this condition,

148
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,265
your fever’s just gonna get worse!

149
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:33,267
But if I do nothing…

150
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,602
That’ll be a problem.
If Cloud spreads out,

151
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,911
it’d be impossible.

152
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:40,707
Then, I must hurry…

153
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:42,307
You can’t!

154
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,646
Your brother just
went to get food for you!

155
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,978
If you aren’t here,
it’ll turn in a big trouble!

156
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,793
You got it now?

157
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,393
Release!

158
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,432
Ho… Hold on!

159
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,140
Reflect my image

160
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,136
and form another me!

161
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:12,772
Mirror!

162
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,927
This way I’ll be okay…

163
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:38,996
Are you okay, Sakura?

164
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,502
Let’s seal the card
quick and go home, okay?

165
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:50,482
Yes.

166
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:55,087
Can you get up?

167
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:07,900
Wanna eat this?

168
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:15,601
Over there!

169
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,874
Cloud should be
inside that whirling storm!

170
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,316
Sakura!

171
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:28,278
Wind Descend!

172
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,586
Li-kun! Mei Lin-chan!

173
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,092
It’s the brats!

174
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,191
Th… Thanks, Li-kun.

175
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:42,634
You still go riding in the wind

176
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,829
in this condition?!

177
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,630
Y… Ye… Yeah, but the ca…

178
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:48,501
Idiot!

179
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,842
In that condition,

180
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,041
what if anything happens to you?!

181
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,448
But I gotta seal the card quickly,

182
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,483
otherwise it’ll cause
a lot of trouble…

183
00:14:57,985 --> 00:14:58,815
Besides,

184
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:01,451
I’ve decided for myself

185
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:02,813
that I’d collect all the cards!

186
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,158
It’s coming’ again!

187
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:12,664
Thanks for the food.

188
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:14,933
You’re done?

189
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,366
Save some so that
I can have more later.

190
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,642
I’ll just make more later.

191
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:27,945
What about the medicine?

192
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,616
You don’t need to take it

193
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:31,785
unless you’re sick.

194
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,183
You aren’t Sakura, right?

195
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,325
We met before.

196
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,554
Did Sakura go out?

197
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,598
Umm…

198
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:47,562
Excuse me…

199
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:49,430
I kinda have an idea

200
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:50,761
as to what she’s been doing.

201
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,063
Can you not tell her

202
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,239
that I noticed?

203
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,409
It seems she wanted to
hide it from me anyway.

204
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:58,943
Okay…

205
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:04,281
Thanks.

206
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:17,694
God of Fire, come forth!

207
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,305
Is that… Rain?

208
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:29,502
They look similar,

209
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,702
but no, this is Cloud!

210
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,704
Return to thy form…

211
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:35,473
Sakura!

212
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:37,875
Mei Lin-chan…

213
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,150
Are you okay?

214
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:45,416
Return to thy
form which thou should be!

215
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,889
Clow Card!

216
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,812
We did it!! Shao Lan!

217
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:14,011
This is yours.

218
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:15,885
Huh?! Why?!

219
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,182
Now this is out of ordinary!

220
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,092
Li-kun…

221
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:23,596
In the end, all the cards
are gonna be mine anyway…

222
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:25,599
This is just for now.

223
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:29,792
Thanks.

224
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,207
I’m back…

225
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:42,842
Are you okay, Sakura?

226
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:44,908
Thanks.

227
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:46,981
You are welcome.

228
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,987
I had a lot of fun too.

229
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:07,999
She went back in safely.

230
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,075
Thank goodness.

231
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,671
And, why didn’t you go back in?

232
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:16,640
Her brother’s taking’ care
of Sakura in her room the whole evening.

233
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:17,906
Who knows when he’ll discover me

234
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,109
if I stay in there.

235
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,445
I’m worried about Sakura,

236
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:21,989
but I guess I have no choice

237
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,857
but to stay at you
two brats for the night.

238
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,217
What’s that supposed
to mean?!

239
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,252
It’s called telling the opposite.

240
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,153
In that case,
it’d be so nice if you’d come.

241
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:30,521
You’re so great!

242
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:31,822
What is this?!

243
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,961
What?!

244
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,577
This is painful…
This is painful…!

245
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,578
Onii-chan…

246
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:02,653
Geez, all because you
did reckless things.

247
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:18,612
I’ll go call the doctor.
Just hang on.

248
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:31,622
Mother…

249
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,866
Same as this morning.

250
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:44,666
This hand…

251
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,664
It’s Mother’s hand.

252
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,316
You’ll be okay now.

253
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:02,454
You came.

254
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,818
Yeah, I was a little worried
since this morning.

255
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,132
Get well, Sakura-chan.

256
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:24,776
Wh… Who is it?!

257
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,438
Father! How come?

258
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,248
Sakura seemed a little strange

259
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:31,576
this morning,

260
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,443
and that kept bugging me…

261
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,916
But it seems
I was just worrying too much.

262
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,285
No, you were right.

263
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,255
She had a fever,

264
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,796
but it’s gone now.

265
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,489
I see.

266
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,793
It must be hard to handle
this by yourself.

267
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:52,571
It wasn’t just by myself.

268
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:55,808
Because Mother came.

269
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,775
I see…

270
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:09,347
Good morning!

271
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,815
Good morning!

272
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,651
Huh? Father, how come…

273
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,158
I came back last night

274
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:18,160
for something I forgot.

275
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,899
I have to leave
again after breakfast.

276
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,297
Are you okay now?

277
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,400
Thanks, Mother.

278
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:33,673
Sakura, why did you say thank you?

279
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,215
Somehow, I had this feeling

280
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,441
that Mother was with me.

281
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,712
Breakfast is ready!

282
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:44,691
Okay!

283
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,723
You just recovered,

284
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,291
so you better start eating it,
monster.

285
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,154
I’m not a monster!

286
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:51,896
A monster can catch a cold too,
I guess.

287
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,967
I said I’m not!

288
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:55,600
Huh? What are you talking about?

289
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:58,631
No, it’s nothing.
Let’s eat!!
