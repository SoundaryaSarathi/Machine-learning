1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:05,767
At the time, I didn't have a TV
or a phone in my room.

2
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:09,877
As a result, I was the last one
to join the party.

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,747
It couldn't have been
more annoying.

4
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:21,877
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

5
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:24,747
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

6
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:31,597
Baby I'm standing alone

7
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,397
An unforgettable rainy day

8
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:37,407
Chasing after your shadow

9
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:40,277
And it's over, it's like sand now

10
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:42,577
I sigh every night

11
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:45,607
I scream like a child and cried

12
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,347
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

13
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:52,407
Please, please God, forgive my sins

14
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,147
I don't need to hide no more

15
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:58,087
Flowing toward the turquoise light

16
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:02,127
Just keep going on

17
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,727
You've got the chance now

18
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:04,927
You've got the power

19
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,437
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

20
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:09,067
I show you my life now

21
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,507
I show you my love now

22
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:13,737
I show you my everything yeah yeah

23
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,977
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

24
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:18,777
Don't ever change so be yourself

25
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,217
I'll show you my strength now

26
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:21,577
I'll show you my love now

27
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,847
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

28
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:28,877
Baby don't be afraid

29
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:32,527
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

30
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:35,217
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

31
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,997
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

32
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,897
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

33
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,957
Kyosuke! Turn on the TV!
The TV!

34
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,547
What's the matter this early
in the morning?

35
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,627
Just turn it on!
You'll know when you see it!

36
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:10,187
Did something happen?

37
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,327
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!

38
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,097
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!
The guru is on TV!

39
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:13,587
REN HONJO'S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!

40
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,457
Hey, that's that cute girl!

41
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:18,697
Hey, you're right.

42
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,827
That cute girl is just as cute
on TV, isn't she?

43
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,567
I think she's more beautiful than cute.

44
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:26,647
No way!

45
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,777
Why is my sister's friend going out
with Ren?!

46
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:29,917
What's the meaning of this?!

47
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,087
- I don't get it!
- You're too loud. I can't hear the TV.

48
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,917
Could that mean the man who got
my sister pregnant is also a celebrity?

49
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,087
She said he works in
the music business, right?!

50
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,227
Who is he?! Who is he?!

51
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,227
How should I know?

52
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,527
Why didn't you ask her?
What kinda parent are you?

53
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,227
The guy got my daughter pregnant!
He must be a jerk!

54
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,197
Damn him! Leave me alone!

55
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:48,867
So that's it?

56
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,697
You only pretended to be lenient
to hide your jealousy.

57
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,537
Nami.

58
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,537
Let's just hope he works for
a proper company.

59
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,647
He's coming over on Sunday.

60
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,137
Don't say anything rude to him, okay?

61
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,117
Huh?

62
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,477
He's coming over? I can't wait!

63
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:08,317
Black Stones is a band that Ren
started back in his hometown.

64
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:12,387
The vocalist Nana,
who was 16 years old at the time,

65
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:15,447
apparently frequented Ren's place,
where Ren was living alone.

66
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,897
Ren was invited to join Trapnest
just before their major debut,

67
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:20,387
so he left his band to join them, right?

68
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,737
And the two broke up once
at that time.

69
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:31,137
Yes. Leaving a band could get ugly
and I hear Nana has a temper problem.

70
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:34,607
She apparently bad-mouthed Ren
to people around her.

71
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:35,837
That's a lie!

72
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:38,777
Be quiet! Whether it's true
or not doesn't matter!

73
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,617
We're going to a commercial break.

74
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:49,227
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

75
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,627
Oh, Take.

76
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:56,737
Yeah, I'm watching it.
Why at a busy time like this?

77
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,797
Give me a break.

78
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,637
I kept telling him to be careful.

79
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,977
This is gonna be so troublesome.

80
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,307
What do you mean troublesome?!
That's a terrible thing to say!

81
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,007
I said be quiet!
Outsiders like you need to shut up!

82
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,717
No, sorry.

83
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:13,857
Outsiders?

84
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:17,247
So where's Ren?
He's not with that woman, is he?

85
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:22,787
Is that so? Then keep an eye on him,
so he doesn't get out.

86
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,857
Just make certain that he doesn't go
and see that woman.

87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:27,587
Yeah.

88
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:33,357
No, I'll go to the office right away.

89
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:36,627
Nana!

90
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:38,307
Where do you think you're going?

91
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,137
I'm going back home to see
how Nana's doing!

92
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,277
I'm worried about her!

93
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,917
Please don't do anything unnecessary.

94
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,447
But this isn't unnecessary!

95
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,707
Takumi, there's something not right
about you as a person!

96
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,557
If you think that,
then don't force yourself to marry me.

97
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,467
If there's something not right
about the father,

98
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:08,097
the child isn't gonna amount to much.
I'm a good example.

99
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,107
Just having parents doesn't
make it all right.

100
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,977
If it's hard by yourself,

101
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,107
then go back and raise it
at your parents' place.

102
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,777
And don't worry.
I'll support the child.

103
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:22,017
In any case,
the way things are shaping up,

104
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,917
I won't be able to come here
for some time.

105
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,357
Do as you wish.

106
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:30,897
Hello, Nana?!

107
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,667
Could the Takumi you were talking
about be Takumi of Trapnest?!

108
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:40,067
No. That's not possible, is it?

109
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:42,067
You're lying. Tell me the truth.

110
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:44,637
When I think about it,
everything adds up.

111
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:48,477
Why are you hiding it from me?
That's so cold of you.

112
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:50,907
Did you think I would tell anyone?

113
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,747
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

114
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:57,657
Jun-chan. I, .,

115
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,497
I'm not forcing myself to get
married only for my baby's sake.

116
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,857
I know that.

117
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,427
I really love Takumi.

118
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:12,037
I know. I'm glad you realized that.

119
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,877
But I thought it was Nobu
I'm in love with.

120
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:17,167
That's just your imagination.

121
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:21,447
As long as a man treats you nice,
it doesn't matter to you who it is.

122
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:22,577
That's not true.

123
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,187
I know that you feel bad for Nobu,

124
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,317
but it's much healthier to come
to terms with your feelings

125
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,447
rather than convince yourself that
you're doing it for money or for the child.

126
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,447
But it was easier to think that
it was for those things.

127
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:40,067
Why is it that when I go
after a guy,

128
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,727
I always end up with self-centered jerks
like Mr. Asano and Takumi?

129
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,367
Huh? I don't know.

130
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,997
So she loved Asano that much?
Enough to still talk about him?

131
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:55,747
Why can't I treat the guys like
Shoji and Nobu

132
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,007
with as much care as they showed me?

133
00:06:57,747 --> 00:07:01,917
If Shoji didn't get sick of me,
I'm sure we would've lived peacefully,

134
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,747
and that would've been the best for me.

135
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:04,157
CHILLS...

136
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,627
CHILLS...
Why is she talking about Shoji
at this stage?

137
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:06,997
CHILLS...

138
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:08,697
CHILLS...
And that would've been the best?

139
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,197
CHILLS...

140
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:09,297
CHILLS...
At this rate, I'll never be happy
for the rest of my life!

141
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:12,987
At this rate, I'll never be happy
for the rest of my life!

142
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:14,137
- Pass.
- Huh?

143
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:14,797
HUH? PASS
- Pass.
- Huh?

144
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:15,027
- Pass.
- Huh?

145
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:16,397
Calm her down.

146
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,867
Come on. Just say something
that'll make her feel good.

147
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,807
Hello, Nana?

148
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,647
Do you have to delay your wedding

149
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:28,737
because Trapnest is caught
in this mess?

150
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,447
WAAAAAAAA!!

151
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:33,817
WAAAAAAAA!
Takumi, you idiot! You bastard!

152
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,257
Takumi, you idiot! You bastard!

153
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,947
Anyway, come by our place.
We'll listen to your complaints.

154
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:41,157
What about class?

155
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,857
No, I'll be fine.

156
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,767
But above everything,
I wanna see Nana.

157
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:50,537
I wanna apologize to her properly
and make up with her,

158
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,467
and I'm thinking about going now
to see how she's doing.

159
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,497
Huh? Go to the apartment?

160
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,767
Right now would not be
a good time.

161
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:01,137
Huh?

162
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,547
There are reporters at your apartment.

163
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:04,407
What?

164
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,677
We are in front of the residence
of BLAST's Nana.

165
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,297
Oh no!

166
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:23,867
I'm gonna be late!

167
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:29,697
Who is it so early in the morning?
Yes?! Who is it?!

168
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,307
We're from Search.

169
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,947
Huh? If you're selling something,
I don't want it!

170
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,107
You're Nana Osaki, right?

171
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,117
We would like to ask some questions

172
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:43,517
regarding your relationship
with Ren Honjo.

173
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,087
It's one thing to show Ren's place,

174
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,217
but why are they showing
the guru's home, too?

175
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:48,987
She's not a celebrity yet!

176
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,197
It's a unique building,
and coupled with the surrounding view,

177
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,387
you can easily tell where it is.

178
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,197
They should sue them for this!

179
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,327
What's Yasu doing?
Isn't he a lawyer?!

180
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,407
Do something about it!

181
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,937
Anyway, Nana,
given what we're seeing,

182
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:05,377
it's quite possible that they've already
found out that Nana had a roommate.

183
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,207
You could end up being showered
with questions.

184
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:09,567
It's better if you don't go.

185
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:11,407
But Nana's...

186
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,517
I understand how you feel,
but think this through.

187
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,277
It would be nothing but trouble
if they find out who you are.

188
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:22,327
What if they find out about
your relationship with Takumi?

189
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,697
If the media made a big deal about it,

190
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,497
Takumi will end up in
an unfavorable position,

191
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,157
and you and your child will have
a tough time living a normal life.

192
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,197
Please don't do anything unnecessary.

193
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,867
Nana will be all right.

194
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,907
She's a smart girl and
she has her band members.

195
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:44,707
I'm a lot more worried about you.
Don't go now.

196
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,087
Nana Osaki!

197
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:58,457
Search... does he mean "Search,"
the weekly magazine?

198
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,597
Please come out for a moment
and talk to us.

199
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,467
We saw you on TV.

200
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:04,327
TV?

201
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,707
If you don't hurry up and
give us an explanation,

202
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,637
things could get pretty ugly for you.

203
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,197
An explanation?

204
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,937
Is that okay with you?

205
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,607
I don't understand what
he's talking about.

206
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:16,077
Is he threatening me?

207
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:20,807
And finally, let's take another look
at BLAST's live video.

208
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,547
Their debut single is expected to be
released soon by Gaia Records.

209
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,117
I can hardly wait.

210
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,427
Nobu...

211
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,897
This program is kinda strange.

212
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:39,827
It's like they're taking advantage
of Ren's scandal to promote us.

213
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:48,277
Nobu! Shin!

214
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,677
- You're here.
- Mr. Kawano.

215
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,657
Neither of you would answer
your cell phone,

216
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,617
so I was getting worried.

217
00:10:56,717 --> 00:11:01,627
I'm sorry. I had turned mine off because
friends were calling me nonstop.

218
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:03,317
Then did you see the broadcast?

219
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:04,497
Yes, we saw it.

220
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:08,137
Then I can get right to the point.
There's a car waiting outside.

221
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,467
Pack your bags quickly.

222
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:10,867
Pack our bags?

223
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,937
Just in case, you are to hide in
a hotel until things calm down.

224
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,567
There's a good chance reporters
will come here.

225
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,037
Wait a minute!

226
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,537
What in the world's going on?!

227
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:22,217
How come we're debuting all
of a sudden?!

228
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,737
We'll talk about it in the car.
We should hurry.

229
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,817
What about Nana?

230
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,887
I left Nana to Yasu.

231
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,227
I'm sure he'll be able to deal with
the media in a professional manner.

232
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:32,317
Don't worry about it.

233
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,257
I am worried!

234
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,657
With all this mess going on,
Nana won't be able to sing!

235
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,487
Is Gaia behind that show?!

236
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,887
That's the video we sent in when
we were promoting ourselves, isn't it?!

237
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,467
But that video had been sent
to many places, right?

238
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:49,837
I hate to say this,
but I can't trust you, Mr. Kawano.

239
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:52,037
You keep saying things to satisfy us,
but they've all been lies.

240
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:57,537
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to trust anyone anymore.

241
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:04,027
In fact, both Yasu and I received
blocked calls this morning

242
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,857
telling us to "watch Morning Seven."

243
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:08,427
What's that?!
A telephone threat?!

244
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:08,657
TOO SCARY
What's that?!
A telephone threat?!

245
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:09,057
TOO SCARY

246
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:12,597
Whoever's behind this,
I'm not clear what their motive is,

247
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:17,087
but what's clear is that they're doing this
so the public will pay attention to you.

248
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,967
But who would do such a thing
other than Gaia?!

249
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,397
The only one who would benefit now
by promoting our band is Gaia!

250
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,367
You really are a good person
right down to the core, Nobu.

251
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,077
You don't think that perhaps the objective
is not to promote the band,

252
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:30,447
but to crush it?

253
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,877
Everyone who watched that
on TV will think it's weird.

254
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,527
You're a member of Black Stones,
aren't you?

255
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,337
Did you watch Morning Seven?

256
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,407
Is it true that Nana's the one
who put that padlock on Ren?

257
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,777
What did you think when Ren left
your band to join Trapnest?

258
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,547
What's going on?!

259
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,477
He's a friend of Ren's woman!

260
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,447
Didn't Nana sell
this information herself?!

261
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:07,617
It's a publicity stunt!

262
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,017
Taking advantage of
Trapnest's popularity!

263
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,787
SILENCE

264
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,217
Listen, you guys.

265
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:22,467
If you have the time to mess
with other people's gardens,

266
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,127
try making your own flowers bloom.

267
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:33,717
REN HONJO'S
LOVE LIFE REVEALED?!

268
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:37,787
REN HONJO'S
LOVE LIFE REVEALED?!
Back to you from
Ren's love interest Nana's home.

269
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:43,877
Oh, boy. He's made enemies outta
the media. That idiot.

270
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,847
He's so cool!

271
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:46,627
TAKUMI!

272
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:46,787
TAKUMI!
Yasu is really awesome!
I'm sorry that I called him baldy!

273
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:50,057
Yasu is really awesome!
I'm sorry that I called him baldy!

274
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:50,367
I LOVE YOU
Yasu is really awesome!
I'm sorry that I called him baldy!

275
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,797
I LOVE YOU
I wanna be Yasu!
But I don't wanna be bald!

276
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:51,867
I wanna be Yasu!
But I don't wanna be bald!

277
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,767
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
I wanna be Yasu!
But I don't wanna be bald!

278
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,927
But look at Ren's popularity.

279
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,197
All the talk shows are talking
about the same subject.

280
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,467
Isn't that nice? It just shows
how peaceful this world is.

281
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:04,507
PEEVED...

282
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:04,677
PEEVED...
But it's supposed to be about
Ren's passionate love,

283
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,447
But it's supposed to be about
Ren's passionate love,

284
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,417
but they're talking about BLAST
more than our band.

285
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:11,747
Oh? You hate to lose, huh?

286
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,277
No, I don't care if I win or lose,
as long as we get attention.

287
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,617
Let's hold a press conference, Takumi.

288
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,817
We'll have Ren tell them
something really cool.

289
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,167
Like "Don't pick on my woman"
or something like that.

290
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,427
Get real.

291
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,567
I'm not gonna be part of
this silly party.

292
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:31,927
Don't come crying to me if BLAST
walks off with everything.

293
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,497
That's fine by me.

294
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,337
We'll maintain our own pace and
rely on our talent.

295
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,277
As long as our CDs sell,
everything's fine.

296
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,297
You sure are confident.

297
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,637
Do you really think that you're the best
in the whole wide world?

298
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,147
Of course not.

299
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:49,487
But I do think that
you're the best in the world.

300
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,657
Don't add any more pressure!

301
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:54,957
- I hate you!
- Mari. Coffee.

302
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:55,587
Yes.

303
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,557
Nana!

304
00:14:58,267 --> 00:14:59,457
This is the worst.

305
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,097
Rumors are out that
this is your publicity stunt.

306
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,427
Doesn't that make you angry?!

307
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:08,427
The last thing I wanted was for
my name to be known as "Ren's woman."

308
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:11,767
If you'll talk to me, I'll write an article
to explain your views!

309
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,667
You're being a pest, damn it.

310
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:14,767
Nana!

311
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:18,877
Don't try to be friendly with me.
It's all over now.

312
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,977
- It's all fallen apart because of you guys!
- Nana!

313
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:24,677
The guy from Black Stones.

314
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,357
Don't dare come inside!

315
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,327
Go away!

316
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,327
Come on. I'm only giving her
a chance to redeem...

317
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,727
Don't act like you're doing us a favor.

318
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,937
Never come close to
our vocalist again.

319
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:49,107
I'm gonna write about
what happened just now!

320
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:52,347
If you wanna save the reputation of
the legal firm that's been so good to you,

321
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:53,337
submit your resignation letter!

322
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:01,817
Nana.

323
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:16,707
Are you all right?

324
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:17,947
Ow!

325
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,237
You idiot!
What are you acting so cool for?!

326
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,277
Think about the position
you're in first, baldy!

327
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:26,287
It's okay. I don't hold
an important position at the firm,

328
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,257
so quitting won't affect anyone.

329
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,847
But it will affect you!

330
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,857
If word gets out that you used violence,
no one's gonna hire you!

331
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,057
Don't throw your life away!

332
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:41,357
It's okay. Now I can go out and
gamble to my heart's content.

333
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:44,327
This guy's a fool.

334
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,097
All our members are fools.

335
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,907
Nobu got disowned by his parents
and dumped by his girlfriend.

336
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,567
Yet he still clings onto his guitar.

337
00:16:56,647 --> 00:17:00,637
Unless something's done about Shin,
he's on a direct path to destruction.

338
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,777
If I don't sing, we have no future.

339
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,417
We are in front of the home
of Trapnest's Ren.

340
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:09,927
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?

341
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,227
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?
The person at the center of
this vortex has not appeared yet.

342
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:13,467
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?

343
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,337
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?
Moments ago,
his agency has announced that

344
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,137
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?
they will be taking a "no comments"
stance on this subject.

345
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:18,307
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?

346
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:19,607
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?
This adds to the speculation about

347
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,777
PUBLICITY STUNT BY BLAST?!
WHAT ARE REN'S THOUGHTS?
this being a publicity stunt
by Black Stones' Nana...

348
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:28,447
Mr. Honjo!

349
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,037
We got directions from the agency.

350
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:33,107
"You're to fly to England this afternoon."

351
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,387
I'm running away?!

352
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,587
Am I a criminal?

353
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,057
It's for a shoot for the cover
and promotion video.

354
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,157
We had planned to do it in Japan,
but with this commotion...

355
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,797
You'll spend about half a month there,
so you should be able to relax a bit.

356
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,797
The other band members and staff
will be going tomorrow,

357
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:53,367
but you and Mr. Takeda
will be going ahead.

358
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,137
I'll drive you to the airport.

359
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:57,127
I got it.

360
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,577
I'll get ready right away.

361
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,167
Things should be a lot quieter
if it's only me and Take.

362
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:02,467
Um, Mr. Honjo.

363
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,017
Are you sure you don't have
to help your girlfriend out?

364
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:09,417
If you wanna retaliate on the media,
I won't stop you.

365
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:15,217
Sadly, my woman has too much pride.

366
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,967
The more I try to protect her
in front of the public eye,

367
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,767
the more miserable she'll be.

368
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,357
What do you mean? I doubt that!

369
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,167
Why do you always do exactly
as the agency tells you to?!

370
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,467
No, she really is like that.

371
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:32,267
This aggressive change in schedule
must be Takumi's idea!

372
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:35,537
Mr. Honjo, you ought to do as you wish!

373
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:39,777
Kinoshita, you're missing the point here.

374
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:42,577
Music is not fun and games for us.

375
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:46,217
Trapnest is no longer
Takumi's own castle.

376
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,627
It's a major project that
involves the agency,

377
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,657
the record label, and other companies.

378
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,887
I can't just do as I please.

379
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:01,227
Being in a band is like sharing
a single destiny.

380
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:05,077
Right now, the people I must protect

381
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,267
are not the friends
I abandoned long ago.

382
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,937
Nana, please make a statement.

383
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,157
When Ren was invited to
join Trapnest,

384
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:16,017
was it you that broke off
the relationship?

385
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,317
Did you get back together with him
to take advantage of him?

386
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,547
Ren says he has no comment about this.
How do you feel about that?

387
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:24,557
Are you happy that you're getting all
the attention according to your plan?

388
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,027
This is stupid.

389
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,617
Say something.

390
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,267
I don't need to say anything.

391
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:35,367
Ren understands me,
and I know the position Ren is in.

392
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:37,207
There's no need to make a fuss.

393
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:45,147
But right now, there's one thing
I must say no matter what.

394
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,487
Please say something!

395
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,087
I won't let them ruin my life.

396
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:10,267
Just watch me, Hachiko.
I will make your wishes come true!

397
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:16,747
I hope you'll be on TV a lot.
Let me see you as you continue singing.

398
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,017
Oh, I feel much better now.

399
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,147
I'm glad.

400
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,657
That's all from the home of Nana,
the woman of the hour.

401
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:36,197
She just threw them a smoke bomb.

402
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,807
The title of the next show
will be something like

403
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,497
"A fearless Nana sends
a mysterious message to her pet dog."

404
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:42,837
That will take them even further off track.

405
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,307
Yeah, she's fearless all right.

406
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,067
And I'm sure they thought
she was talking about a dog.

407
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:52,877
You know, Hachi...

408
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,157
Ever since that day,
I was able to get right back up,

409
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,217
no matter how many times
I got struck down...

410
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:02,057
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE
THE ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART.

411
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:05,397
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE
THE ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART.
...because I knew you were
always watching me.

412
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,727
REN HONJO
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN WHO STOLE
THE ROCK-N-ROLL HERO'S HEART.

413
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:13,707
I can't count
how many nights

414
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:18,467
I wished tomorrow
would never come

415
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:25,247
To live as I am
without being fake

416
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,847
What do I need

417
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:36,987
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

418
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:42,157
The answer is
too close to see

419
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:48,397
Black tears are
falling down

420
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:55,347
I have nothing,
only sadness

421
00:21:55,417 --> 00:22:00,437
I can't put it
into words

422
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:06,517
My whole body
starts to ache

423
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:11,927
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
