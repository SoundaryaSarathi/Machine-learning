1
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,350
Congratulations, Louise Françoise.

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,447
I really am unworthy of such
an honorary title as Chevalier.

3
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:25,759
You all achieved something
that deserves that title.

4
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,957
Capturing the thief that had
the entire Palace up in arms...

5
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,392
I thank you as well,
trustworthy familiar.

6
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,062
Oh, no...

7
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,543
I trust that you will continue to
take good care of my dear friend.

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,445
You should not, Princess!

9
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,481
To allow your hand
to such a familiar...

10
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:51,952
To protect you is equal to
swearing loyalty to me.

11
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,388
There must be something in return
for such an oath of loyalty.

12
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,966
A hand? So I'm being treated
like a dog after all?

13
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,668
That's not it.

14
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,170
To put it bluntly, you can kiss her.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,405
Ki...

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,134
I can't be that fearless!

17
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,404
Hurry up. You're being rude.

18
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,447
Then, excuse me.

19
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:35,796
Huh?

20
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,032
What did you just do to
the Royal Highness?!

21
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,432
You dog!

22
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:47,674
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

23
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:56,173
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:06,720
The sky where two moons
never fade away

25
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,790
That's an impossibility, right?

26
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:19,540
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,512
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

28
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:31,815
Even if you trip and
become depressed

29
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:39,255
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

30
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:46,133
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

31
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:52,606
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

32
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:58,579
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

33
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:06,918
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

34
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:15,261
Louise's Part-time Job

35
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,926
I am terribly sorry about this!

36
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,133
Hey!

37
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,068
Hurry up and apologize!

38
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,558
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,739
But you said I could kiss her.

40
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,642
What idiot out there
would kiss her lips?!

41
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,609
Right here.

42
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,615
It is all right...

43
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,550
A reward is necessary
for an oath of loyalty.

44
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,622
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

45
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,657
Please, go ahead and
ask anything of us.

46
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,125
If you tell us to die, I will immediately

47
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,228
throw myself out of the window,
and take this stupid dog with me!

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,630
Wait, hold on! What are...

49
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,131
Be silent!

50
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:55,702
I would like you two to live
in the village for a while.

51
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,896
In the village?

52
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,898
Thank you!

53
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,248
So dull...

54
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,384
But you're the one
that said we needed

55
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,909
to buy new clothes
to dress up as peasants.

56
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,057
But don't you think we can get
some clothes that are more decent?

57
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:21,028
Come on, do you really get what
we're supposed to be doing?

58
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,757
Of course I do!

59
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,625
This is a warrant published
by the Palace.

60
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,108
You want us to do some
spying in the village?

61
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:41,181
Lately, I often hear rumors of
nobles oppressing the peasants.

62
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,283
When I asked those in the area,

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,219
all of them said that such a thing
would never happen,

64
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,287
as the nobles were good
role models for the peasants.

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,658
However, seeing the case between
you two and Count Mott,

66
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,649
I cannot discount them
as simple rumors.

67
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,830
Therefore, I would like you

68
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,734
to investigate the goings-on
in the village in secret.

69
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,104
It will be a very difficult job.

70
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,740
Well understood, Princess!

71
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,040
I will make sure to get this job done,
as if my life depended on it!

72
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,686
Now I'm worried about
what's going to happen.

73
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,415
Next up is a horse.

74
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,951
A horse?!

75
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,162
Really... A horse costs 400 equs?

76
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,766
One horse uses up all
the money we were given!

77
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,666
200 equs?!

78
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,703
Our inn is top-class, one where
even nobles can spend the night.

79
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,277
We don't have nearly enough money.

80
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,946
You can look for
a cheaper inn, can't you?

81
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,916
No way. I can't sleep
in a cheap room!

82
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,875
So this job was impossible for
a girl of noble birth after all.

83
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,758
Fine, I'll make do by myself somehow!

84
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,192
Make do? What are you going to do?

85
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,126
Don't follow me!

86
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,918
Hey!

87
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,446
You blew it all at the casino?!

88
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,040
But they said I'd end up
with more for sure.

89
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,986
That's why I can't leave you alone.

90
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,721
Be quiet!

91
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,451
I'm thinking about what
we should do from here.

92
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,861
No choice but to bow down to the
Princess and get some more, right?

93
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,832
This task is one that the Princess
asked as a personal favor.

94
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,835
I'm sure she had lots of trouble
coming up with the money.

95
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,404
You knew that,
yet you wanted a horse,

96
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,373
and just had to sleep
in an expensive inn...

97
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,965
I'm amazed you could want so much.

98
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,434
Because I need them.

99
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,278
I'm hungry.

100
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,853
Finding somewhere to sleep
comes before food.

101
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,753
Trés bien!

102
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,224
Such a beautiful face!

103
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,827
From the looks of it, you seem
to be in some sort of trouble.

104
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,562
Bonjour! Bon!

105
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:12,199
As you can obviously see,
I am nobody suspicious at all.

106
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,535
No, better to say you are,
from the looks of it.

107
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,268
I am Scarron. I run
a tavern just up ahead!

108
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,275
A tavern?

109
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,844
Yes! A tavern!

110
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,347
Would you like me to furnish
you two with one of our rooms?

111
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,482
Really?

112
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,416
Saito!

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,785
H-o-w-e-v-e-r, on one condition.

114
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,394
Understood, my fairies?

115
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,295
Yes, Manager Scarron!

116
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,865
Not like that!

117
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:49,136
When we're in the shoppe, I've told
you to call me "Mi Madmoiselle!"

118
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,866
Yes, mi madmoiselle!

119
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,963
Trés bien!

120
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,076
Such ecstasy!

121
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,079
Now, good news to all fairies!

122
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,015
We have someone new joining us here

123
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,006
at the Enchanting Fairy Tavern today!

124
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,547
Louise, come on in!

125
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,958
Louise is a poor little girl
who ran away

126
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,294
with her older brother
right before her father

127
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,930
sold her off to pay for
his gambling debt!

128
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,831
Oh, my!

129
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,264
Poor thing!

130
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,335
I'm Louise.

131
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,005
Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,233
Now, applause!

133
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,910
Oh, man...

134
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,504
She looks pretty upset.

135
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,949
Hey, new guy, come help
clean the dishes!

136
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,884
We're about to open!

137
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,943
Sure, right away!

138
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,322
You have a very cute younger sister.

139
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,254
Thanks.

140
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,992
What?

141
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,463
Nothing. I'm Jessica. You are?

142
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,430
I'm Saito.

143
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,490
Saito? That's an unusual name.

144
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,031
I get that a lot.

145
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,205
Nice to meet you, Saito.

146
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,106
Ask me if you have anything you
want to know about this place.

147
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,034
Nice to meet you!

148
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,179
That stupid dog...

149
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,874
Now, everyone...

150
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,084
Now that I've introduced our new girl,

151
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,076
I'm pleased to announce that this
week is the long-awaited tip race!

152
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,852
Tip race?

153
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:23,129
The fairy who earns the biggest
tip total gets a special bonus.

154
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,289
And, ta-dah!

155
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,902
You will have the right for one day
to wear the family heirloom

156
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,540
that is our namesake,
the Enchanting Fairy Bustier!

157
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,634
So wonderful, mi madmoiselle!

158
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,946
Trés bien!

159
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,084
This bustier is enchanted with
magic that charms people,

160
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,219
so the day you wear this,
you can earn without limit!

161
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,255
Earning without limits?!

162
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,924
The girl who won the race
last year earned so much,

163
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,260
she went back to her hometown!

164
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,495
So all of you, do your best,

165
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,364
in hopes of being able
to wear this bustier!

166
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,999
Yes, sir!

167
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,489
You too, new girl!

168
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,261
Sure!

169
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,635
This is my chance!

170
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,451
I've brought you what you ordered.

171
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,681
What are you doing, girl?

172
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,185
Hurry up and pour it.

173
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,920
Serving a peasant... Me, a noble?

174
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,928
What are you dong? Hurry up with it.

175
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,033
This is a mission. This is a mission.

176
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:37,436
Then, I would like to serve you now...

177
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,675
What are you doing?!

178
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,006
I'm sorry...

179
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,245
You're a cutie.

180
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,339
It's a shame that you
don't got much boobs!

181
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,142
Then, to make up for it, I want you
to serve me mouth-to-mouth.

182
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,588
What was that for, you brat?!

183
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,359
You filthy scum!

184
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,055
How dare you do this to a Duke's...

185
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,466
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

186
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,603
She's a new girl, so she's
not used to this yet.

187
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,739
Louise, bring a new washcloth.

188
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,070
Okay!

189
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:19,145
In her place, I'll provide you
with very special service!

190
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,046
Hold on, stop it... No!

191
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,218
You've got to be kidding!

192
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,489
Why do I, a daughter of a Duke,
have to deal with such a...

193
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,091
Calm down...

194
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,827
For now, we've secured
a place to sleep and some food,

195
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,262
and on top of that we can
make some money.

196
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,831
A place to sleep? Where?

197
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,467
You mean this attic that
looks more like a closet?

198
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,836
He said that a lot of his
customers were nobles.

199
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,565
So we're killing three birds
with one stone, right?

200
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,273
You're well off.

201
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,743
You seem to be having
fun with that girl.

202
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,144
Girl?

203
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,146
Nothing.

204
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,716
But you're going to make a noble
like me sleep in a place like this?

205
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,241
If you don't want to sleep,
you can do whatever you please.

206
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,622
There were too many things
going on today, so I'm tired.

207
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,792
How can you adapt
to things so quickly?!

208
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,528
Well, that's the only good trait I have.

209
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,053
Besides, it's not much different
from how I'm usually treated.

210
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,383
Geez! His master is forced
to wear something like that,

211
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,485
and he feels nothing of it?

212
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,146
At the least, he could...

213
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,595
Why do I...

214
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,644
What, she's just a kid!

215
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,135
I thought this place
promised sexy girls...

216
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,184
You're very pretty!

217
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:08,254
Coquettish girls like you are my type.

218
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,188
Especially those really flat...

219
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,226
You're Mr. Scarron's daughter?!

220
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,496
Oh no, you broke another one.

221
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,792
That's right. I'm in charge of
what goes on in the tavern.

222
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:29,340
To think someone like this can be
born into this world from such...

223
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,580
Louise, you just sit here and
watch how the other girls do it.

224
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,275
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,250
Welcome!

226
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,352
Why do I have to dress up
in this embarrassing outfit

227
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,421
and sell favors to these people?

228
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,557
And on top of it, they keep
saying I'm so small and flat.

229
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,493
Oh, really? Mr. Scarron did?

230
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,893
Yeah! He seems to
like you an awful lot.

231
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,357
He said you were his type!

232
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,601
Breasts!

233
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,660
He's after breasts like the others!

234
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,810
Ouch...

235
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,644
Huh?

236
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,812
Are you all right?

237
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,849
You passed out when a flying
bottle of wine hit your head.

238
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,852
Bottle? Why would a bottle...

239
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,253
Hey, Louise isn't your sister, is she?

240
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,324
What's this all of a sudden?

241
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,426
I can tell just looking at you two.

242
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,363
But it's not like you guys are
dating each other, either.

243
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,899
You know, Jessica, you're mistaken...

244
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,601
And Louise... She's a noble, isn't she?

245
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,537
What... What are you talking about?

246
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:36,305
There's no way that such a violent,
inelegant girl would be a noble.

247
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,878
Just as I thought.

248
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,882
She didn't even know how to carry
a plate in the beginning, right?

249
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,486
That unusual amount of pride
in herself, and her behavior...

250
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,655
She's got to be a noble.

251
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,357
So you're her servant or something?

252
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,293
I'm no servant.

253
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,595
It's better you keep
yourself out of this.

254
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,298
What's that? You're crossing some
dangerous bridge or something?

255
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,632
That sounds like fun!

256
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,235
I love stories like that!

257
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,570
Come on, tell me.

258
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,405
I won't tell anyone else about it.

259
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,241
Well, you say that, but...

260
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,246
In exchange, I'll teach you
all sorts of stuff!

261
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,249
Um... Teach what?!

262
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,518
Don't ask the obvious!

263
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,450
Um...

264
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,056
What are you doing?

265
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,785
Gathering information!

266
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,295
Did you know that she's
the owner's daughter?

267
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,565
So I was asking about the
customers that come and go...

268
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,228
What information have
you been gathering?!

269
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,811
You really are a stupid dog!

270
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,579
Hold on, Louise.

271
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,547
What?!

272
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,315
What about your work?

273
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,483
Shut up!

274
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,954
I'll go back as soon as I train
this stupid dog... stupid brother.

275
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,490
Do you have that much free time?

276
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,560
You can't even get any tips
worth a damn.

277
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,963
Oh well, I guess you can't help it,
with such a meager...

278
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,031
What is it?!

279
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,700
Just because I don't have big breasts,
people call me a brat, a water flea...

280
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,726
No... Nobody said water flea...

281
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,908
Just you watch! If I put my mind
to it, I'm really amazing!

282
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,309
Is that so?

283
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,268
That means that you'll win the tip
race we're having for sure, right?

284
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,276
Of course I will!

285
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,323
Today is the last day,

286
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,484
but at this rate, not only
will I miss first place...

287
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,690
Ahem!

288
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,001
My, my, if it isn't Lord Chelenne.

289
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,370
It is nice of you to come
all the way out here.

290
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,940
It looks like you have been
quite prosperous.

291
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,443
Oh, no, today is just coincidence.

292
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,578
Usually, we're so empty, you'd
be able to hear a cuckoo cry.

293
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,149
Enough with the excuses! I have
come here today as a customer.

294
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,518
Unfortunately, all the seats
are taken right now.

295
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,453
It doesn't seem that way to me.

296
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,863
I guess you were right when you
said the place was really empty!

297
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:21,174
Come on, is there no one to serve
the Royal Queen's levy collector?!

298
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,375
Who's that?

299
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,411
That's Chelenne, the guy in charge
of collecting the levy around here.

300
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,381
If we stand up against him,
he puts a huge levy on us,

301
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,916
Come now! Hurry up!
So no one running a business
can stand up against him.

302
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,144
So no one running a business
can stand up against him.

303
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,855
He fondles as much as he wants,
but doesn't pay any tips at all.

304
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,380
No girl that works here
would serve him.

305
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,482
Someone's going up to him.

306
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,865
He's a rich-looking noble.
This is my chance!

307
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,832
Louise!

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,468
That idiot...

309
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,096
You are a charming man, sir.

310
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,810
Does this place employ men now?

311
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,777
Men?

312
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,116
Upon a closer look, it's just
a girl with really small breasts.

313
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,519
They're so flat that I thought
you were a man!

314
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,479
Now, let me take a closer look
at exactly how small they are!

315
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,889
Don't mess with me!

316
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,827
Non!

317
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,568
What?! Damn you!

318
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,636
Such insolence!

319
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,471
You are a mere peasant!
How dare you...

320
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,464
Please forgive her.
She just started working here.

321
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,903
Shut up! How dare you?!

322
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,147
Saito!

323
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,445
Knock it off, pops.

324
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,585
How dare you kick
the face of a noble...

325
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,586
So what if you're noble?

326
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,455
What was that?!

327
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,424
The only one that is allowed
to touch Louise is me!

328
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,828
Capture these two!

329
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,197
I'll have them hung!

330
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,222
Who's going to capture who?

331
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,834
You'll be surprised when I tell you!

332
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,893
I was the one that got
the infamous thief...

333
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,040
It's in the attic!

334
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,142
Capture him and that
washboard-breast girl!

335
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,044
Hold on just a second!
Capture him and that
washboard-breast girl!

336
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,518
Washboard is a bit much,
don't you think?!

337
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,187
Louise, where did that wand...

338
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,246
Don't put me in the same boat as you.

339
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:20,451
I had tied it to my thigh
in case of an emergency.

340
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,996
I went to the trouble of serving you...

341
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,191
Why do I have to be insulted so?!

342
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,968
Are you a noble?

343
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,605
I have no name to give to
a lowly official like you.

344
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,472
Before you regret it, just shut up
and get out of here!

345
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,611
Are you a fallen noble
that is hiding her identity?

346
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,602
Who do you think I am...

347
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,911
Who are you calling a fallen noble?

348
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,181
A writ from the Palace?

349
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:52,291
Please, please forget what
just happened. I'll offer this.

350
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,827
Please, I beg you!

351
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,898
Forget everything you've seen and
heard here today. Understood?

352
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,602
Yes! In the name of the Royal
Highness and our Founder,

353
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,866
I will not say one word of this!

354
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,542
That was amazing, Louise!

355
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,778
To depress that sketchy creep!
You're the best!

356
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,303
Idiot. You shouldn't be using magic.

357
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,550
But...

358
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,554
We don't ask any of our employees
about their background.

359
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,690
So we didn't see anything,
and we didn't hear anything.

360
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,791
Right, everyone?

361
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,282
Right, of course!

362
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,194
You're the winner.

363
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,690
There's no need to count.

364
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,169
But he just put this here.

365
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,039
He put it here on his own,
so it's a tip. Right, Papa?

366
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,040
Oui!

367
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,066
The winner of the tip race is Louise!

368
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,615
They say that,

369
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,676
but now that our cover is blown,
we have to leave.

370
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,190
What are you doing?

371
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,624
If you're going to change, I'll help...

372
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,556
Don't look!

373
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,026
What are you saying after all this...

374
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,333
That's the Enchanting Fairy...

375
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,904
Since I was given the opportunity,
I decided to borrow it.

376
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,771
I mean, it would be a shame
if I didn't, right?

377
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,646
It's not because of magic, is it?

378
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:25,640
What? I went through the effort
of putting it on, so say something!

379
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,622
Trés bien!

380
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,114
At the least, compliment me
in some other way.

381
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,063
So late at night... What do you want?

382
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,305
I have come to pick up our comrade.

383
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,175
Fouquet the Sculptor... no...

384
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,700
Matilda of South Gotha.

385
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,169
You're...

386
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:11,660
As if I were under a real magic spell

387
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:22,698
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

388
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:34,220
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

389
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:45,324
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

390
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:57,301
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

391
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:08,176
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

392
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:14,417
For the day to start from zero

393
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,842
Noisy Kirche and Tabitha apparently
went home for the summer,

394
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,278
so this Institute has
gotten quite lonely!

395
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,446
Wait... Hey, dog!

396
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,482
Who do you think you're flirting with
while completely naked?!

397
