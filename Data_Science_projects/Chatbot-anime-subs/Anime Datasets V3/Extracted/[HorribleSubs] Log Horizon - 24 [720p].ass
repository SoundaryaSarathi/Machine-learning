Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.04,0:03:57.29,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.18,0:04:00.72,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,In {\i1}Elder Tale{\i0}, there were no quests
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.72,0:04:03.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,that involved removing someone from power.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.41,0:04:07.30,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,And it isn't something adventurers \Nwould think of, is it?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.56,0:04:13.69,Default,A,0000,0000,0000,,I understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.69,0:04:17.08,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,So, you believe this Westelandian is trying
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.08,0:04:19.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,to destroy the Round Table's reputation?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.53,0:04:23.95,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,Given the number of People of the Land involved,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.48,0:04:27.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the odds are high that someone \Nimportant is running things.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.66,0:04:30.45,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,That's what I'd thought,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.23,0:04:33.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and it appears I wasn't too far off.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.73,0:04:36.96,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,Then the attack is from the west?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.46,0:04:43.84,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,But why would he want to destroy \Nthe Round Table's reputation?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.22,0:04:45.98,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,It's only one step in the plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.48,0:04:48.18,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,Most likely, he's trying
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.80,0:04:53.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,to take advantage of the confusion so he can \Ninterfere with the Eastal-Round Table treaty.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.16,0:04:58.06,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,So that Eastal can't monopolize the benefits of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.24,0:05:00.12,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,We need to act quickly.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.91,0:05:10.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,it calls into question our problem-solving ability.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.27,0:05:13.52,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,That's exactly what he wants.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.07,0:05:18.29,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,The best choice is probably to minimize \Nthe damage and wait things out.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.97,0:05:20.69,Default,H,0000,0000,0000,,Then, how do we react?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.01,0:05:25.41,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I'm sure they've at least anticipated \Nthe possibility of a counterattack...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.74,0:05:28.76,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,So we'll give them one.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.81,0:05:33.77,Default,A,0000,0000,0000,,But my lord,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.50,0:05:35.77,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,we're going to fight, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.77,0:05:40.10,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,No, I didn't mean we'd start \Nany kind of bloodshed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.58,0:05:42.46,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,This time, we won't need those.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.95,0:05:48.03,Default,N,0000,0000,0000,,Report to you?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.15,0:05:59.54,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Aren't Isaac and his buddies on this?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.38,0:06:02.89,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,We have more ground to cover than expected.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.46,0:06:05.11,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,And if I want to set up

Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.97,0:06:12.70,Default,N,0000,0000,0000,,Can you ask the other guilds for help?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.06,0:06:16.21,Default,S,0000,0000,0000,,If they knew the Round Table was \Nworked up enough to take action,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.21,0:06:18.55,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,it'd give the enemy what they want.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.02,0:06:21.33,Default,N,0000,0000,0000,,So we need to ask for help \Nfrom whoever's available,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.33,0:06:23.90,Default,N,0000,0000,0000,,as long as it isn't enough for them to notice.
