1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,502
You say you'll do haircuts for free,

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:08,139
but you take advantage of girls
who have little allowance!

3
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:11,342
I can't forgive such a
crooked monster!

4
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:14,277
Tuxedo Mask, you agree
with me, don't you?

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,339
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

7
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

8
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

9
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

11
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

12
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

13
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

14
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,031
Endymion!

16
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,519
Endymion!

17
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:31,863
No more... No more about me
being the Moon Princess.

18
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:35,869
No more about having to fight
against the Dark Kingdom.

19
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,202
I don't want that. I just want
to stay a normal...

20
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,976
Usagi, hang in there! You have
to keep yourself together!

21
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,820
You said that you would fight
together with everybody,

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,550
but you're actually still...

23
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,962
It's heavy! It's heavy, Usagi!

24
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:02,699
Tuxedo Mask, where are you?

25
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,497
Please be all right.

26
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,603
Usagi...

27
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:21,908
Usagi is Confused!
Is Tuxedo Mask Evil?

28
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,913
Juban Municipal Junior High School

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,859
Hey, hey, Usagi! Take a look!

30
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,296
A new hair salon's open for business
in Juban Shopping District.

31
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,999
The salon's owned by Kariko
Tokoyama,

32
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,134
who just won the world hair
design contest last month!

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,571
And that's not all! Are
you ready for this?!

34
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,573
She's going to cut hair free
of charge for a while

35
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,167
in celebration of the grand opening!

36
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:50,110
Isn't it wonderful?! Let's go!

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,812
What's wrong? You're
not very energetic.

38
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,928
Hikawa Shrine

39
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,029
It's true.

40
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,399
Usagi doesn't seem to be sleeping
well these days.

41
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,633
Even if she falls asleep for a little bit,

42
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,736
she seems to just have bad dreams.

43
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,504
Poor Usagi.

44
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,273
We still don't know what happened
to Tuxedo Mask

45
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:18,875
after the enemy took him away?

46
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,571
No, he's still missing.

47
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,954
Usagi's so worried about Tuxedo Mask,

48
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,823
she can't focus on anything right now.

49
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,992
That's not good.

50
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,728
We need Usagi to be more aware
of herself as the princess,

51
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:39,896
or we'll be in big trouble!

52
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,532
But it can't be helped.

53
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,300
The man she loves has been abducted,

54
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,530
and we don't know what's
happened to him.

55
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,708
I can understand how she feels, too.

56
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,735
Oh? It's rare to hear you show
concern for Usagi.

57
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,775
Mamoru did all that just to protect
a coward like you...

58
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,619
Mamoru did it all...

59
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,555
Sorry.

60
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,927
I know it must be tough, but there's
no time to indulge Usagi!

61
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:15,098
That's right! This is all so we can
crush the Dark Kingdom's ambitions!

62
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,635
She needs to become a full-fledged
princess as soon as possible

63
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,934
and master how to use
the Silver Crystal.

64
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,807
I wish I could somehow
help Usagi recover.

65
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:50,424
Crying doesn't suit you,
dumpling head.

66
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,067
You're so mean!

67
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,229
Is my hairstyle really that weird?

68
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,009
Kariko Tokoyama

69
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,513
Kariko Tokoyama

70
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:04,036
Kariko Tokoyama

71
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,178
That's the hair salon that
just opened, isn't it?

72
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,185
Minako...

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,954
Sorry, you didn't answer, so
I decided to just come in.

74
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,560
Hey, Usagi,

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,188
how about a new hairstyle
for a change of pace?

76
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,897
What?

77
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:35,468
How about the appealingly mature
and stylish bob cut?

78
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,011
Or the slightly bold sauvage style?

79
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:45,118
Or how about a nice and modest
look with long, straight hair?

80
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:49,192
A girl's mood can change a great deal,

81
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,683
just by changing her hairstyle.

82
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,196
Yeah. A hair salon, huh?

83
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:54,998
Kariko Tokoyama
Yeah. A hair salon, huh?

84
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,898
Kariko Tokoyama

85
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,407
Kunzite.

86
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,253
Queen Beryl.

87
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,223
No matter what it takes,

88
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,784
we must steal the Silver Crystal
from Sailor Moon!

89
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,727
Yes, my lady!

90
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,565
You still do not know who
Sailor Moon is?

91
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,768
Please give me just
a little more time.

92
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,599
Do not take too long.

93
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,273
Find out who Sailor Moon
is immediately,

94
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,639
and steal the Silver Crystal!

95
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,712
Please leave it to me.

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,548
I have already set the next
plan in motion.

97
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,015
Really?

98
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,959
This is a strand of Sailor Moon's hair,

99
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,294
which I obtained during battle.

100
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,364
I will find the person with
the same hair,

101
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,197
and uncover Sailor Moon's
true identity without fail.

102
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,863
Good. Act with care.

103
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:10,105
Yes, my lady!

104
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,086
Hello.

105
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:28,549
Welcome to Kariko Tokoyama.

106
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:33,060
Could you do something
with this girl's hair?

107
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,297
Of course.

108
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:39,730
My, you have such beautiful hair!
Please come this way.

109
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:47,477
If there are any itchy spots,
please just tell me.

110
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:48,944
Okay...

111
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,009
Usagi, I hope you feel
better after this.

112
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,023
Please stay like this for a while.

113
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:34,446
No. That girl is not Sailor Moon either.

114
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,815
Thank you for waiting.

115
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,197
Please come to the hair steamer.

116
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:45,001
Oh, no. I just came here
with my friend.

117
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,270
Then please give our hair
steamers a try.

118
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,931
I'm sure we won't disappoint.

119
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,275
Our hair steamers use a special steam

120
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,278
that even fixes damaged
hair in no time.

121
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,237
Well, I guess it's okay.
It's free, after all.

122
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,248
Please stay like this for a while.

123
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:44,049
I have found you, Sailor Moon.

124
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:48,393
Oh, could you move a little
more to the right?

125
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,760
I have finally found out who
Sailor Moon is!

126
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:24,023
Ms. Kariko, are you done
shampooing my hair?

127
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:27,204
I have found you, Sailor Moon!

128
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:28,671
What?!

129
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,309
Minako?!

130
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,622
No!

131
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,419
You must not sleep!

132
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,561
Now, hand over the Silver Crystal!

133
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,051
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,498
Don't play dumb!

135
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:59,492
The computer told me that your hair
is the same as Sailor Moon's!

136
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,537
What?

137
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:09,875
I see, that's when Usagi's
hair got onto me...

138
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:14,952
So, you absolutely refuse to hand
over the Silver Crystal.

139
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:18,479
In that case, I have some ideas
on how to change your mind.

140
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,809
Oh, no!

141
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:45,115
Oh, no. The Dark Kingdom turned
Ms. Kariko into a monster!

142
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:48,051
Wait there, Minako,
I'll rescue you soon.

143
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:51,885
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

144
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,296
Stop it!

145
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,969
She is not Sailor Moon!

146
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,664
Impossible!

147
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,607
You say you'll do haircuts for free,

148
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:47,043
but you take advantage of girls who
have little allowance!

149
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:52,841
Sailor Moon will not forgive such
a crooked monster!

150
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:56,079
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

151
00:13:57,454 --> 00:14:00,057
To think you came here on your own!

152
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:03,627
Just like a slug jumping
into a heap of salt!

153
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,094
Slug?!

154
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:11,066
I am the monster Mitsuami and
I will melt you like a slug!

155
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:15,938
Usagi...

156
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,766
Wet hair must be dried!

157
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,579
No!

158
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,542
I will shave your unwanted hair!

159
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:40,629
No, no, no, no, no, no!

160
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,935
Why you...

161
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,214
Monster Mitsuami! No! Ms. Kariko!

162
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:58,415
With the Crescent Moon Wand,

163
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:02,749
I will turn you back into the old
Ms. Kariko Tokoyama!

164
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,418
Moon Healing...

165
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,525
This is...

166
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,663
It can't be... It can't be...

167
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:32,514
Tuxedo Mask!

168
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:43,452
You're safe! I'm so glad!

169
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,919
I am not who you think!

170
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:48,465
What?!

171
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:53,095
I am a commander of the Dark
Kingdom, Endymion.

172
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:55,932
You can't be!

173
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,632
Sailor Moon, hand over
the Silver Crystal!

174
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:03,140
Why? How come?

175
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,024
Finally, the engine started.

176
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,491
What?!

177
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:21,765
Mitsuami! Take the Silver
Crystal from her!

178
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,233
Yes, Sir!

179
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,268
This can't be happening.

180
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:28,260
I shall shave your head!

181
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,498
No way!

182
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,847
I have to contact everyone with
my communication device.

183
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:43,218
Tuxedo Mask is our enemy?

184
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:46,056
All right.

185
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,719
Venus Power Makeup!

186
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:17,785
Sit still and just let me
shave your head!

187
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,997
My head will come off if you
shave my head with that!

188
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,065
What are you doing, Mitsuami?!

189
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,201
Hurry up and get the Silver Crystal!

190
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,668
This can't be...

191
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,249
Are you ready now?

192
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:47,716
Stop right there!

193
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:52,856
Everyone!

194
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,290
Fire

195
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,323
Supreme

196
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,998
Soul!

197
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,793
Thunder!

198
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,242
Bubble

199
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,709
Spray!

200
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,220
Shoot!

201
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,089
Now, Sailor Moon!

202
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,556
Okay!

203
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:39,630
Moon Healing Escalation!

204
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:45,408
Shampoo, rinse, refresh!

205
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,808
Refresh!

206
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:55,875
Tuxedo Mask!

207
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,814
You're safe!

208
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,688
Mamoru...

209
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,196
Sailor Mars, he is not the
Tuxedo Mask you know!

210
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:10,496
He is a commander of the Dark
Kingdom, Endymion!

211
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,734
That can't be true.

212
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:18,239
It's not true, is it? Please just tell
me it's a lie, Tuxedo Mask!

213
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,011
Roses have thorns.

214
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:22,712
You must know that even a
red rose turns black

215
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,577
when exposed to a wintery blast.

216
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,817
Why?

217
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,620
Are you really going to fight us?

218
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,054
I do not enjoy fighting women,

219
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:36,951
but I will show no mercy in order to
get the Silver Crystal!

220
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,290
Endymion, withdraw this time.

221
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,302
What?!

222
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,964
This is an order from Queen Metalia!

223
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:56,046
Sailor warriors, it seems your time
of death has been postponed.

224
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,447
What?

225
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,749
Women's friendships are fleeting.

226
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:03,742
Just like a fragile flower, they fall
apart at the slightest breeze.

227
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,181
Be careful.

228
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,224
Good-bye.

229
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,441
Why did you tell me to come back?

230
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,143
Endymion,

231
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:37,315
I cannot have you die.

232
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,193
It seems Endymion has become

233
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:46,429
a warrior of the Dark Kingdom,
both in mind and body.

234
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,489
Yes, my lady! The brainwashing
was very effective!

235
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:55,238
From now on, I expect Endymion
to be quite useful

236
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,729
as a warrior of the Dark Kingdom.

237
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,522
Ms. Kariko is just an ordinary person,

238
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,923
who has nothing to do with our fight.

239
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:18,628
I don't want people like her to get
mixed up in our fights anymore.

240
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,964
Well, she finally seems
to be more aware

241
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:22,864
of what it means to be the princess.

242
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:30,373
But, I'm glad that Tuxedo
Mask is still alive!

243
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,008
Oh, boy...

244
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:35,345
Just how is she aware of being
the princess again?

245
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:39,213
No! She's just trying to
act tough there!

246
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:42,546
At the very least, it means Usagi
has grown up as a person.

247
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,818
You, too, Rei. You can't mope
about this forever.

248
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:49,514
You're right.

249
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:54,531
Tuxedo Mask is probably just being
controlled by the bad guys

250
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,800
and being used by them!

251
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,897
So, I'll restore him back to his old
self with the power of my love!

252
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:14,805
