1
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:06,945
– Good morning…
– Good morning.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,347
Hey how did you know we have a test
at 1 o’clock today?

3
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:13,184
Really?

4
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:15,818
I see. That was a nice shot!
That’s great! What should I do?

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,792
I…

6
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:24,221
I…

7
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:30,262
I really like you!

8
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:33,802
Good morning!

9
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:43,411
…Sakura-chan?

10
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,081
Sakura-chan!

11
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,383
Oh… Tomoyo-chan, good morning.

12
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,800
Oh! Good morning Li-kun!

13
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:10,972
Good morning…

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,845
g… good morning…

15
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,108
Good morning…

16
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:28,857
Everyone have a seat!

17
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,021
Okay.

18
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:42,135
I have some bad news for everyone.

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,576
Hiragizawa Eriol-kun is
transfering to England.

20
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:53,511
He will be leaving tomorrow,
so he’s not in class right now.

21
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:54,182
Sakura-chan…

22
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:56,780
I’m going,

23
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:59,017
are you coming too?

24
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,357
Yeah.

25
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,830
[Sakura and Her True Feelings]

26
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:18,400
This is the house where he lives.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,691
Someone is inviting you.

28
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:37,192
Watch yourself.

29
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,274
Sakura…

30
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:10,053
I feel Clow’s aura.

31
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:12,630
Yes… I remember…

32
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,393
Yue and I did live here with Clow.

33
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:19,903
But you haven’t remembered until now?

34
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:23,667
He used magic to erase our memories.

35
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,143
Then how did you just remember?

36
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:29,105
I wonder why?

37
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:36,886
Come to think of it,
Eriol said yesterday “It’s finally over”…

38
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:48,923
If anything odd should happen,
Tomoyo, you…

39
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,800
I have my camera ready!

40
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,204
Tomoyo-chan…

41
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,642
Come on, lets go.

42
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:10,917
Be careful.

43
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:30,537
Welcome!

44
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,238
We’ve been waiting for you.

45
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,445
Now, please, come this way,
it’s all ready for you!

46
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:41,842
O… ok…

47
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:45,582
Wait right just a minute!
What’s waiting for us!?

48
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,523
Can’t you see it’s a tea party?

49
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,258
Nobody told me about this!

50
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:57,068
Have some sweets, then we can talk.

51
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:02,730
OKAY! Only Clow could be this nice!

52
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,343
Please, take a seat.

53
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,874
Don’t worry, it’s over.

54
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:13,313
Over?

55
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,784
Here you go.

56
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,086
Thank you very much.

57
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,052
Now what did you wish to talk about?

58
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,531
What did you mean
when you said “It’s over”?

59
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,360
You said the same thing yesterday.

60
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:34,201
Yesterday, the last of the Clow cards
were turned into your Sakura cards.

61
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,807
My task is finished. That’s what I meant.

62
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,102
Task?

63
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,345
The cards

64
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,243
live off of

65
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:49,183
the magic of their master.

66
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,714
Without Clow Reed to support them,

67
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:56,025
they would have become regular cards.

68
00:05:57,563 --> 00:06:00,031
You have saved them

69
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,295
with your magic.

70
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,400
And so…

71
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:09,296
You created problems
that would cause Sakura to use the cards.

72
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:15,536
It was my duty as the
reincarnation of Clow Reed.

73
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:24,587
I must apologize for what is to come.

74
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:28,987
Clow-san…

75
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:34,890
Wait a minute! Why didn’t you
just ask at the beginning!?

76
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,338
If we had, you wouldn’t
have tried as hard.

77
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:40,904
WHAT?!

78
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:45,510
Eriol decided that
this was the best way.

79
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:50,347
We didn’t know what
the new card mistress was like

80
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,050
and this would work no matter what.

81
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,577
Right, Sakura-chan?

82
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:55,615
Y… yes.

83
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,084
Do you get it now?

84
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,723
I GOT IT!

85
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,055
Thank you.

86
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,463
I understand it all now.

87
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,466
As the new mistress,

88
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:13,866
I had to refresh the cards with my magic.

89
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,241
That’s not quite all.

90
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:22,205
There were other things
I couldn’t predict.

91
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:27,081
What kind of things couldn’t you predict?

92
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:29,986
Uh. What kind of…

93
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,421
Don’t worry about it.

94
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,328
I’ll have to keep those a secret.

95
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,841
Actually, there’s another
guest you should meet.

96
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:56,244
I wonder who it could be.

97
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:57,879
I don’t know who.

98
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:01,417
She has been waiting to see you.

99
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:05,687
Please come in.

100
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,053
Ah!

101
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:23,536
Mizuki-sensei!

102
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,641
The shrine lady?

103
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:30,611
It’s been a long time.

104
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,679
Why are you here?

105
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:38,849
You knew? About Eriol?

106
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:40,823
Yes.

107
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,119
I met him while
I was at the University in England.

108
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:48,957
I heard he was Clow Reed’s reincarnation
and thought I might help him.

109
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:55,298
That’s how you got the bell
he made for the final judgment.

110
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,275
He asked me to deliver it for him.

111
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:00,946
Thank you very much.

112
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:02,946
You’re welcome.

113
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,781
Then… when I wrote to you about
the strange things that were happening…

114
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:12,019
I really wish I could
have told you the truth…

115
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:13,517
I’m sorry.

116
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:19,891
So, everything was Clow’s plan.

117
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,256
Not quite.

118
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,463
I’ll go fetch some more snacks.

119
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,868
Now that we’ve changed all the cards,

120
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,338
it’s time to PARTY! LET’S EAT!

121
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,104
Suppi eat too!

122
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,710
AHH!

123
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:41,915
He’s being weird again!

124
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:43,481
I’m not weird!

125
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,484
Why don’t you come in, Yue?

126
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,665
I still haven’t heard your answer
to yesterday’s question.

127
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:58,936
Why did we have to get a new master
if you would be reborn?

128
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:02,398
I’m surprised you haven’t realized…

129
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,909
Even though I have his memories,

130
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,740
I am not truly him.

131
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:15,452
He will never fully return.

132
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,587
That is why he left you two
to Sakura-san.

133
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:22,691
Even so… Even so…

134
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:29,059
Why couldn’t you have waited, Clow?

135
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,173
It’s not that I don’t like
our new master…

136
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,008
You like her a lot.

137
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:45,315
But…

138
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,483
Clow is no longer.

139
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:52,017
But, you still remember him.

140
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:55,827
You can talk to me whenever you wish.

141
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:58,719
About he who is so important to you.

142
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,129
Clow…

143
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,466
I am very glad I came here.

144
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:10,633
To meet Sakura, you and Kerberos.

145
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,277
But there were two things
I couldn’t predict.

146
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,813
The first was you. I could not predict

147
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,413
how your false form’s heart would choose.

148
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:28,355
I thought Yukito would have
fallen for Sakura-san…

149
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:31,027
The other was Sakura’s heart.

150
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:38,328
I couldn’t foresee how
either of them would react.

151
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,547
Yes yes I’m coming.

152
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,317
Yes, Li residence.

153
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:58,115
Oh my! It has been a while
since we heard from you.

154
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:11,034
Master Shao Lan,
there is a phone call from your mother.

155
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:12,902
Eh? From mother?

156
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,734
Hello, this is Shao Lan.

157
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,113
Yes.
And you?

158
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,880
Yes, the Clow cards have all…

159
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,724
Well done!

160
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,829
Next is… let’s see here…

161
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:52,076
Hey you know what? Yamazaki-kun hasn’t
told a lie since Hiragizawa-kun left…

162
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,140
That’s true…

163
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:55,737
Aren’t you glad, Chiharu-chan?

164
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,478
It seems a bit strange, I guess.

165
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:05,017
Sakura isn’t as cheerful
as she used to be, is she?

166
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:06,482
I wonder what’s wrong.

167
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:41,988
Do you have a minute?

168
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,071
Um… I…

169
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,003
I got a phone call
from my mother yesterday…

170
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:03,509
and…

171
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:10,088
the Clow cards have all been changed

172
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,581
and nothing strange is happening anymore…

173
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:15,751
Yeah…

174
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:25,593
Umm… I…

175
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:31,337
I’m glad I got the chance to meet you.

176
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:38,947
When I came to Japan,
all I could think of was myself.

177
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:45,390
My head was filled with the
Clow cards and becoming stronger.

178
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:49,558
You would do your best

179
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:53,192
and try your hardest for anyone.

180
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,161
I couldn’t do that.

181
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:57,624
That’s not true!

182
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:02,373
Ever since I met you,
you’ve been courageous and helpful…

183
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:07,106
I couldn’t have done it without you… and…

184
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:11,411
Thank you.

185
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,980
That’s all I wanted to say. See ya.

186
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,549
Shao Lan! Wait…

187
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,423
I…

188
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:29,528
I don’t know how I feel about you…

189
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:35,038
Mizuki-sensei has returned.

190
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,565
I saw her yesterday.

191
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:41,002
It seems she knew all about it.

192
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:44,545
About Clow Reed and all that…

193
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:47,445
damn, she could have said something…

194
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,782
Still, I’m glad.

195
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,562
He made my false form

196
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,455
Because of that

197
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,566
I met Sakura, and you, Touya.

198
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,139
Sakura-chan?

199
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:12,975
Did something happen?

200
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,148
Hey, Sakura… what is it?

201
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,811
Do you have a fever?

202
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,147
I’m fine.

203
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,749
You’ve been
so strange since yesterday…

204
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,525
what happened?

205
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,493
I really like you!

206
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,232
I like him too…

207
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:40,394
but only as a friend?

208
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:41,871
Is that all?

209
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,567
It seems different.

210
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:50,579
But it’s different from
how I felt about Yukito too…

211
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,248
Which feeling is it?

212
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,553
Well have you told her yet?

213
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:04,395
Yeah.

214
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:06,962
What did she say?

215
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,265
She hasn’t said anything.

216
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,563
What!? Why!? But today’s your last…

217
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:17,105
It’s ok. I told her how I feel.

218
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,368
It’s not ok.

219
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,973
Geez… how can you let her go?

220
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,806
I’ll talk to you later, Mei Lin.

221
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:25,774
Hey wait! Shao Lan!

222
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,453
It’s almost time.

223
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:33,291
Ok.

224
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:48,131
Let’s go, Wei.

225
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,176
(Touya’s part time job.)

226
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,639
Good morning, Sakura-san.

227
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:01,881
Good morning.

228
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,548
What’s wrong? You don’t seem happy.

229
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,025
I’ll get it.

230
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:14,690
Yes, Kinomoto residence.

231
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,867
Oh Tomoyo? What’s wrong?
Don’t you have choir…

232
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:23,706
I overheard Terada-sensei
talking about it…

233
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,743
Li-kun is going back to Hong Kong
on the 11 o-clock plane today!

234
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:32,908
He won’t be coming back! Sakura?

235
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:38,687
Are you listening?
Sakura-chan! Sakura-chan??

236
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,726
Shao Lan-kun is going back…

237
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,236
That can’t be true…

238
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,836
That can’t be true…

239
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:05,216
That can’t be true…

240
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:09,513
What I feel… to Shao Lan…

241
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:52,395
Sakura… card?

242
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,635
Shao Lan-kun…

243
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,439
I’ll check your luggage.

244
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:10,546
Ok.

245
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,075
Will she be mad

246
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,378
that I leave without telling her?

247
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,158
I wonder what her
answer would have been…

248
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:27,422
I hope it hasn’t caused her trouble…

249
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,535
Shao Lan-kun!

250
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,008
How?

251
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:49,079
I…

252
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:51,816
umm…

253
00:20:58,964 --> 00:20:59,828
Shao Lan-sama…

254
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:01,964
here you go.

255
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:16,803
Can I have that bear?

256
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:33,527
=I am a dreamer=
=with power deep inside.=

257
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:43,768
=My world=

258
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:51,244
=is made from dreams,=
=love and uncertainty.=

259
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:58,181
=But something I couldn’t even imagine=

260
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:02,050
=must be hidden as well=

261
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:06,922
=Like a tree facing at the sky=

262
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:11,994
=I stare at you…=

263
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:17,531
=Wanna find out,=
=wanna realize…=

264
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,935
=“believing”, just with this…=

265
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:23,836
=everything can be overcome.=

266
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,945
=like singing a song,=
=like a miracle…=

267
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:34,748
=“missing” changes everything gradually,=

268
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:39,623
=for sure,=
=for sure…=

269
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:46,095
=will surprise me!=

270
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,043
I’ll see you again, right?
