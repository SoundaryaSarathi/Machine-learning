1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,169
Go round, merry-go-round!

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,160
Go up, pink Ferris wheel!

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,540
This is a great place! An amusement
park that entices girls!

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:14,109
It's a terrible crime to use our
innocent, dreaming hearts!

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,312
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

7
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

8
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

9
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

10
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

11
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

12
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

13
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
I believe in it, miracle romance

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,769
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

16
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,106
I'm clumsier than others

17
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:03,074
and a bit of a crybaby.
That's about it.

18
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:07,246
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

19
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:09,214
and gave me a peculiar
transforming brooch

20
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,317
and made me a sailor warrior.

21
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:14,115
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

22
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:16,581
That makes me really nervous.

23
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:20,157
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

24
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:31,837
Usagi vs. Rei?
A Nightmare in Dreamland

25
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,271
Hikawa Shrine

26
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:38,706
When the three of you get together
like this, it's so heartening.

27
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,246
But, we shouldn't get overconfident.

28
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,248
Our battle is still ahead of us.

29
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,616
Hey! A Sailor V comic book!
Our battle is still ahead of us.

30
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:45,818
Hey! A Sailor V comic book!

31
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,821
No! I haven't finished it yet either!

32
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,955
Oh, come on! Cheapskate!

33
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:50,456
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia.
Oh, come on! Cheapskate!

34
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,123
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia.

35
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,624
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia.
Let me borrow it!

36
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:53,955
In other words...

37
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,262
Rei, don't pull it too much!
You'll end up tearing it!

38
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:57,696
Rei, don't pull it too much!
You'll end up tearing it!
So what I'm trying to say is...

39
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:58,993
So what I'm trying to say is...

40
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,758
That's enough!

41
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:08,966
Having three of you is meaningless,
if you're always like this.

42
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,011
Be more aware of yourselves
as warriors.

43
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,479
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,414
Easy for you to say.

45
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:17,316
So, what do you want us to do?

46
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,717
Like I've been saying,

47
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:22,084
you girls need to work together
to find the princess!

48
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:22,721
How?

49
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,822
She must have a sign hanging
on her saying who she is.
How?

50
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,025
She must have a sign hanging
on her saying who she is.

51
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,458
Oh, okay!

52
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,661
Come on, you two...

53
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,497
She doesn't?!

54
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:34,625
Unbelievable! Then there's
no way we can find her.

55
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:41,505
Then let's do something else until Luna
gets information on the princess.

56
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,208
Something else?

57
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,812
We'll protect everyone from the eerie
enemies that threaten the peace!

58
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:47,980
You're the best, Ami!

59
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,547
Another Disappearance?!
You're the best, Ami!

60
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:49,448
Another Disappearance?!
Look at this!

61
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:49,812
Look at this!

62
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,418
Oh, this is Dreamland!

63
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,719
Dreamland?

64
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,812
Remember? It's a new amusement park.

65
00:03:56,722 --> 00:04:00,123
They say something mysterious
is going on in Dreamland.

66
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:02,093
Something mysterious?

67
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,664
Of the people who went to Dreamland
in the last week,

68
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,791
fifty have gone missing.

69
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,514
To think you allowed a third
sailor warrior to join them...

70
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,715
Jadeite!

71
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:24,950
Yes, my lady!

72
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,977
You do not have many opportunities
left to redeem yourself.

73
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:33,358
I'm already working on a plan to steal
a large amount of energy.

74
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,586
Really?

75
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:38,727
I will also kill those three
sailor warriors, without fail!

76
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,262
Do not forget what you have just said!

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,434
Remember, I can always replace you!

78
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,164
I understand.

79
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:00,352
Dreamland
Management Office
Information Desk
Park Announcement Office

80
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:05,085
Dreamland
Management Office
Information Desk
Park Announcement Office
So, I do not think these incidents have
anything to do with Dreamland.

81
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:11,658
But the fact is, fifty of your customers
have gone missing!

82
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,500
The number of people who came in
and who came out of here

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,626
has been the same everyday.

84
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:19,204
It is not as if those people
disappeared here.

85
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,708
Now, any more of this will be
considered obstructing our business.

86
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,175
Please leave!

87
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,973
How violent!

88
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,884
Stupid humans...

89
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,131
If the number matches,

90
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:48,497
did those people disappear on their
way home from Dreamland?

91
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,930
But it's strange that only people
who come here disappear.

92
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:55,908
That's true.

93
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:58,809
Oh, where did Usagi go?

94
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm sure she's goofing off
somewhere again.

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,214
No way.

96
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:02,681
Yay!
No way.

97
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,171
Yay!

98
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:09,454
Yahoo! Yahoo! I'm riding a horsie!

99
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,944
Yeeha! Whoa! Whoa!

100
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,159
I can't believe you!

101
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,296
Just what were you thinking, Usagi?

102
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,287
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

103
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:23,024
Be more responsible! And you call
yourself a sailor warrior?!

104
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,205
Don't be so bossy!

105
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:28,537
I do a good job when I have to!

106
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:39,950
A lion?

107
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,522
Hello.

108
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:44,022
It...

109
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:44,690
It spoke!
It...

110
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,679
It spoke!

111
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:53,960
Don't worry, he's a mechanical lion.

112
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,259
You're the Dream Princess!

113
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,165
I wanted to see you!

114
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:03,031
You said it's mechanical?

115
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,010
Yes. It's controlled by
a remote control.

116
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,554
It's amazing!

117
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,129
Something's wrong!

118
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,061
What?

119
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,235
You're adorable, Mr. Bear!

120
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:33,305
Usagi!

121
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:34,533
Get off!

122
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,372
What are you doing?!

123
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,876
I sense a strange aura coming from
that Dream Princess.

124
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,804
That can't be...

125
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,884
You just don't get it because
you're so dense!

126
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,720
Hey!

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,382
Is that any way to treat your senior?!

128
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:55,193
I have a show at the candy house
in an hour.

129
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,461
Please come and see me.

130
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:57,587
Of course!

131
00:07:58,764 --> 00:07:59,992
The candy house?

132
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,706
That must be the candy house!

133
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,435
I have to go!

134
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,854
Come, sailor warriors.

135
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,616
I will suck out all of your energy
until nothing is left.

136
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,096
Once someone gets in here,
they can never get out.

137
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,164
I see nothing wrong.

138
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,043
Okay, let's split into
two groups and look!

139
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:48,903
Ami will come with me.
Usagi, go with Rei!

140
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,273
What?!

141
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,374
If you don't want to, that's fine!

142
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:53,811
But...

143
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,384
Then, we'll see you later.

144
00:08:58,357 --> 00:08:59,958
We're going, too!

145
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,653
Don't be so bossy!

146
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:09,296
Are you suspecting the
Dream Princess?

147
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,693
My hunch is usually right.

148
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:15,173
She doesn't look like a bad person.

149
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,970
You just don't understand.

150
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,343
Look! Even the animals are adorable!

151
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:23,181
Your name is also an animal,
since it means "rabbit".

152
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:24,876
What do you mean by that?

153
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:26,952
Oh, no!

154
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:29,284
No! Don't get on that animal!

155
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:33,792
Why? It's mechanical, but
it's safe, you know.

156
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,259
I don't care, just get him off!

157
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:37,488
Okay, then.

158
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,023
Let's do it again later.

159
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:42,701
No! You should ride it now!

160
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:43,902
Hey!

161
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,137
It's not a big deal!

162
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:48,004
Oh, you're so happy-go-lucky!

163
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,875
Rei, you're just too suspicious! Relax!

164
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,348
No!

165
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,483
It's okay!

166
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,723
No!

167
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:08,791
It's okay!

168
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,362
I said, no!

169
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:10,796
I said, it's okay!
I said, no!

170
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:11,592
I said, it's okay!

171
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,262
What are you doing to my boy?!

172
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,234
Mommy.

173
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:27,310
It seems like we're just playing.

174
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,513
This is the best way to patrol.

175
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:38,323
I am sorry, it is a stop signal.

176
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:40,292
Please wait for a moment.

177
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,660
Oh, man...

178
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,854
Hey!

179
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,329
What? You, again?!

180
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,567
Wait a minute! You rammed me
with your rock-hard head!

181
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,136
That's no way to treat me,
you dumpling head!

182
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:55,573
Dumpling head, is it?
I can so see that!

183
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,576
They also look kind of like
hot spring buns.

184
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:58,243
Oh, you're right!
They also look kind of like
hot spring buns.

185
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:58,944
Oh, you're right!

186
00:10:58,944 --> 00:10:59,578
Oh, you're right!
See?

187
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:00,245
That's enough, both of you!
See?

188
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,736
That's enough, both of you!

189
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:07,542
Anyway, what's a guy doing on
a toy train all by himself?!

190
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:10,188
Could it be you're actually
a really big loser?!

191
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:14,249
You make me laugh! Hahaha!
It's so funny, my tummy hurts!

192
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,989
I've got my reasons for being here!

193
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:21,996
She just had to touch a sore spot.

194
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,293
Hey, Mr. Panda!

195
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:28,537
Don't keep doing this stop and go!

196
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:32,566
A show will be starting at
the candy house.

197
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:33,745
A show will be starting at
the candy house.

198
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,047
Mr. Panda, stop! Stop!
A show will be starting at
the candy house.

199
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:36,445
A show will be starting at
the candy house.

200
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:39,809
I cannot just stop and go anytime.

201
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:44,012
He's so inflexible!

202
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:46,291
Hey, hey! The guy sitting
in front of us...

203
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,657
Doesn't he sort of look like
Tuxedo Mask?

204
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,964
No, he does not!
He looks nothing like him!

205
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:17,949
Luna!

206
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,823
Oh? Where's Ami?

207
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,354
Inside!

208
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,798
No fair! No fair!

209
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,663
Why did she get to go in by herself?!

210
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,662
I feel an evil aura.

211
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,108
Wow! These are real sweets!

212
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:36,342
Amazing!
Wow! These are real sweets!

213
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:37,274
Amazing!

214
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,146
These candies look like gems.

215
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:41,480
They're beautiful!

216
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,783
We may find some kind
of clue in here.

217
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:44,943
Ladies and gentlemen!

218
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,520
Welcome to the candy house!

219
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,855
Please enjoy the show!

220
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,186
Okay!

221
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,332
It's like a dream.

222
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,562
I wish I could stay here
like this forever.

223
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,537
No way! This just can't be possible!

224
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,736
I will take your energy while
you are dreaming.

225
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,690
I see! That apple collects energy...

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,394
As I thought, this is the place where
everyone disappeared.

227
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,508
What's wrong?

228
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,310
Something's happened inside!

229
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,144
What?!

230
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:45,444
Oh, no! Ami is...
What?!

231
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:46,809
Oh, no! Ami is...

232
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,817
It's no use! It's locked!

233
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:53,785
No! Ami!

234
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,781
Don't cry about every little thing!

235
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,457
Aren't you worried about Ami?!

236
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,159
I didn't say that!

237
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,823
No, Rei, you're a cold person!
I realize that now!

238
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:07,133
Don't jump to conclusions!

239
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,068
Both of you, transform now!

240
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:13,937
Mars Power Makeup!

241
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:29,088
Come on, Usagi, you, too!
Don't waste time!

242
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,612
I know!

243
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,958
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

244
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,022
Fire

245
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:17,998
Soul!

246
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,075
Let's go!

247
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:23,542
She's being bossy again!
Let's go!

248
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,702
She's being bossy again!

249
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,576
So, you have come, sailor warriors.

250
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,282
Today will be your last day!

251
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,788
Welcome to the candy house.

252
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,255
I have been waiting for you.

253
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:48,534
Be careful! This is an illusion!

254
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:50,195
Here, this is a present for you.

255
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,536
Oh, thank you.

256
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,436
Stop it!

257
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:01,841
Sailor Mars!

258
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,941
I'm sorry! It's my fault.

259
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:10,089
You're in big trouble now.

260
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,959
The poison will spread through your
blood and you'll turn into stone.

261
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,358
See?

262
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,161
Don't panic over something this small!

263
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:22,468
Be gone, evil spirit

264
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:27,807
Be gone, evil spirit
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai,
Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!

265
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,741
Be gone, evil spirit

266
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,168
Be gone, evil spirit!

267
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,117
Thank goodness!
I'm so glad for you!

268
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:39,675
There's no time to cry!

269
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:42,517
It's time you revealed who you are!

270
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:44,455
Very well.

271
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,555
Please wait for a moment.

272
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,225
I am the monster, Moolyd.

273
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:25,063
Nice to meet you.

274
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:27,933
Oh, the pleasure is ours...

275
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:28,991
Hey!

276
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,561
Oops!

277
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,232
Hey, monster!

278
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:37,109
I can't forgive you for using the
innocent hearts of dreaming maidens!

279
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,872
By maidens, are you
referring to yourself?

280
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:41,213
Does it really matter?!

281
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:42,414
Well, anyway!

282
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,882
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

283
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:47,119
Ooh, how scary.

284
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,679
Let's go have another dream, shall we?

285
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,764
Watch out! It's another illusion
created by the monster.

286
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:02,461
I'll be all right this time! I won't fall
for anymore stupid traps!

287
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:03,998
I don't know about that.

288
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,340
The sound of a horse's hooves!

289
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,842
It's coming this way!

290
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:11,139
Be alert!

291
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,981
Tuxedo Mask!

292
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,847
He's absolutely gorgeous!

293
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,524
He's so cool!

294
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:26,926
Hey, hey!

295
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,294
That's a trap!

296
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:29,556
Hey!

297
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:32,430
Hello?!

298
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:35,393
You're falling right into
the enemies trap!

299
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,636
You really did fall into the trap.

300
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:40,833
I will take your energy while
you are dreaming.

301
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:52,484
Oh, please wait for me!

302
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:53,644
What?

303
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:59,889
You should dream only when
you're sleeping. Goodbye!

304
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,729
What? Where's Tuxedo Mask?

305
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:04,753
What is this?

306
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:08,331
Was Tuxedo Mask really
here after all?

307
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,971
I will let you dream one more time.

308
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,903
Let's get out of here for now!

309
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:25,985
I shouldn't have come all by myself.

310
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,316
Ami!

311
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,421
Are you okay?

312
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:30,823
You came here to help me!

313
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:32,415
I hope we can, but...

314
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,050
Uh-oh!

315
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,030
Everyone, that apple is what
absorbs the energy!

316
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,327
What?!

317
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,400
All three of you need to work together!

318
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,201
Right!

319
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:45,034
Mercury Power Makeup!

320
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,022
Oh?

321
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,390
Aim for that apple!

322
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,591
Okay!

323
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,252
Bubble

324
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:13,559
Spray!

325
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:19,034
Oh? Where am I?

326
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,176
Be gone, evil spirit!

327
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:43,951
Moon Tiara Action!

328
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,387
Fire

329
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:52,198
Soul!

330
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:58,443
I cannot move.

331
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,575
Shoot!

332
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,726
We did it!

333
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,396
Darn you, sailor warriors.

334
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,843
You will pay for this!

335
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,142
Listen!

336
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:42,180
You were able to win because
all of you worked together!

337
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:44,285
Don't forget about what
happened today.

338
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:45,817
Yes, I know!

339
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:50,019
Hey, isn't yours bigger than mine?

340
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:53,398
Don't be ridiculous! You picked
which one you wanted!

341
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:54,333
Trade with me!

342
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:54,733
No way!
Trade with me!

343
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:55,501
Dreamland
No way!

344
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:57,136
Dreamland
Hey, trade! Trade!

345
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:57,568
Dreamland

346
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:12,674
In my dream, you and I were together

347
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:19,585
Protected by the stars

348
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:34,803
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

349
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:41,941
And we casually talked to each other

350
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:50,753
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

351
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:57,687
I want to become prettier
right here and now

352
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:05,236
Something changes when
you fall in love

353
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:11,805
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

354
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:25,691
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
