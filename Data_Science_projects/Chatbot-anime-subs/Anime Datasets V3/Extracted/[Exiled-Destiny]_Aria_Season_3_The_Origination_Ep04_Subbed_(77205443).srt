1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,030
I wonder if I'm useful to the Aria Company?

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,470
What's with you all of a sudden?

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,600
You're not acting like yourself, Akari.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,410
Well...

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,610
Don't worry! I'm sure Alicia isn't
bothered by it, even if you are useless.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,780
Useless?

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,210
It doesn't matter if you're a burden, it's fine.
Useless?

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,780
It doesn't matter if you're a burden, it's fine.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,080
It doesn't matter if you're a burden, it's fine.
A bur... den...

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,570
A bur... den...

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,100
"Dear Ai, for the past few days, the weather
has been really nice in Neo-Venezia."

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,900
"When the weather is nice, for some
reason, you just feel refreshed."

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,350
"I'm done with my usual early morning practice,
so now I'm starting today's work as an apprentice."

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,200
Okay, let's work hard today, too!

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,570
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,970
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,960
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,700
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,240
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,610
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

21
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,050
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

22
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:08,510
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:18,570
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

24
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,640
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:32,350
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

26
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:41,280
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

27
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,980
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,430
President Aria...

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,680
Alicia's really busy, isn't she?

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,940
She only gets one day off a month, if that.

31
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,780
Those Who Aim For Tomorrow...

32
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,410
Akari?

33
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,910
Yes?

34
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,580
What's the matter?

35
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,890
No, umm...

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,780
I...

37
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,590
I want to be more useful, Alicia.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,490
My, my.

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,900
You're already a big help.

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,680
More...

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,380
I want to be even more useful to the company.

42
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,780
But there's only so much I can do as a Single...

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,790
Akari, are you having joint practice tomorrow?

44
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,120
Well...

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,690
Aika has to take care of some company
business, with Akira as her instructor.

46
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,970
And Alice has something to do for school,
so she can't come tomorrow, either.

47
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,660
I see.

48
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,440
Then, how about trying
your hand at the traghetto?

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,910
Traghetto?

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,360
"Dear Ai, at Alicia's suggestion, I've decided
to challenge myself on the traghetto."

51
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,560
"A traghetto is a gondola that's used as a ferry."

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,470
"There are several boarding points along
the city's main thoroughfare, the Canal Grande."

53
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,630
"Two gondoliers, one at the front and
one at the back, transport the passengers."

54
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,570
"The traghetto is the only place where Singles are
allowed to take customers without supervision."

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:24,710
"Singles from different companies are paired up,
so it's something of an attraction in Neo-Venezia."

56
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,690
Um, the meeting point should be...

57
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,470
Gather around, Singles!

58
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,730
Ah, this is it.

59
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,630
Yes, yes!

60
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,170
Ah, so many people are here already...

61
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,810
Gather around, she said!

62
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,740
Huh?

63
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,710
Right!

64
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,070
I will now announce the groups for this district!

65
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,480
North upstream will be Arabella Campbell,
Arly Harvey and Irene Wolce.

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
It's finally time to scull the traghetto.
North upstream will be Arabella Campbell,
Arly Harvey and Irene Wolce.

67
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,250
Meeting and working with people...
North upstream will be Arabella Campbell,
Arly Harvey and Irene Wolce.

68
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,890
...for the first time on a new job is kind of exciting.
Downstream will be Ann Kawahara,
Alberta Quincy and Aba Elliot.

69
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,190
I'm still just an apprentice,
but I'll do my very best!

70
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,090
Excuse me... Hello?

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,420
Yes! I'm still just an apprentice, but!

72
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,800
Huh? Where'd everyone go?

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,430
They all went to their respective posts.

74
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,630
Ah, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,470
The four of us are in charge of this pier.

76
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,340
I look forward to working with you today.

77
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Yes! I'm Akari Mizunashi from
the Aria Company. Pleased to meet you.

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,540
Here, have a candy.

79
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,050
When you're nervous, having something
in your stomach helps calm you down.

80
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,030
Thank you very much.

81
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,890
I'm Atora from Orange Planet.

82
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,930
Let's do our best together.

83
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,730
Is this your first time sculling a traghetto?

84
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,140
Y-Yes.

85
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,940
Hey, Ayumi. It might be tough
right off the bat, don't you think?

86
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,410
Hmm... Yeah, perhaps.

87
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,580
Unlike a normal gondola, on a traghetto
the customers will be standing,

88
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,210
and some people might have lots of luggage,
so it requires a unique sense of balance.

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,890
Do you think I'll be all right?

90
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,960
You'll be fine. That's exactly why we scull in pairs.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,190
You'll have us assisting you.

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,130
Well then, how about the three
experienced members go on rotation first,

93
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,400
and whoever's on shore will give her a lecture?

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,890
Okay.

95
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,210
I'm sorry for troubling you all.

96
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm Ayumi from Himeya. Nice to meet you!

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,070
Yes, nice-

98
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,380
So anyway, do you like the traghetto?

99
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,010
Huh? Sure...

100
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,320
I like it, too! Especially because
you get to work with the locals!

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,220
I see...

102
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,890
Um...

103
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,290
Ah, yes!

104
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm Anzu from Orange Planet.

105
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm Akari Mizunashi. I look forward
to working with you today.

106
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,870
Okay, let's get to work!

107
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,240
Come on, Anzu. Let's do this.

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,510
So then, Ayumi and Anzu,
prepare the gondola, please.

109
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,180
Okay!

110
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,080
Right.
Okay!

111
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,890
We will be open for business shortly.

112
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,460
Good morning, Atora.
We will be open for business shortly.

113
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,960
Good morning.
Please form a line to the left.

114
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
Please form a line to the left.

115
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,260
Oh, I haven't seen you before.
Nice to meet you, Miss Undine.

116
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,530
Yes, it's a pleasure to be of service.

117
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:23,730
Please Wait
Yes, it's a pleasure to be of service.

118
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:23,900
Please Wait

119
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,630
Please Wait
Thank you for waiting.

120
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,290
Thank you for waiting.

121
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,370
Good morning!
Good morning!

122
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,070
'Morning.

123
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,500
Please watch your step.
'Morning.

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Please watch your step.

125
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,740
Wow, those tomatoes look delicious!

126
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,410
I bought too many, though!
Maybe I'll make some trippa for lunch.

127
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,210
Ah, sounds nice.

128
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,180
In we go.
Ah, sounds nice.

129
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,350
In we go.

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,880
Hey, Ayumi.

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,870
Good morning, Mister.

132
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,110
There we go.

133
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,680
Good morning, Anzu.

134
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,420
Good morning.

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,130
My, my. What's the matter?
You seem a bit down.

136
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,400
Eh? No, not at all.

137
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,070
Ayumi, Anzu, everything's all set!
You're good to go!

138
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,570
Okay!
Okay!

139
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,970
The gondola is now departing!

140
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,040
Anzu's a bit down right now.

141
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,790
It's because she just recently
failed the Prima Promotion Exam.

142
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,360
Ehh? The Prima Promotion Exam?

143
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,290
Yeah.

144
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,550
Well, we all know that passing it is no easy feat.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
But she's really something.

146
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,630
Even though she's disappointed every time,
she continues to challenge herself and retake it.

147
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,210
Um, is the Prima Promotion
Exam really that hard?

148
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,370
Yeah.

149
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,620
A mentor from your company acts
as the examiner, so the difficulty varies,

150
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,210
but it's significantly more difficult
than becoming a Single.

151
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,830
Anzu and I have the same mentor,
and she's a very strict woman, so...

152
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,030
Thank you very much.

153
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,170
Welcome aboard.

154
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,430
Thank you.

155
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,880
The gondola is now departing!

156
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,010
Yup, that's right.

157
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,170
She's quite down, isn't she?

158
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,420
Becoming a Prima sure must be tough.

159
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,690
Ayumi, you make it sound like
it doesn't concern you.

160
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,750
It doesn't, though.

161
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,930
I'm not going to become a Prima.

162
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,900
Huh?!

163
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,370
Well, I guess there aren't many Undines like me,
who want to work with the traghetto from the start.

164
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,070
Most likely, the majority of Singles here are only
doing this because they couldn't become Primas.

165
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,120
The traghetto may serve as a training ground
for Singles hoping to become Primas,

166
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,560
but it's also a place where you
can work and earn a living.

167
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm sure being a tour guide is a wonderful job,

168
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,800
but working here allows me to stay
involved with this city and its people.

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,320
That's why I love this job.

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,870
The gondola is now departing!

171
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm depressing, aren't I?

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,920
N-No, not at all...

174
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,270
I recently failed the Prima Promotion Exam.

175
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,830
The Prima Promotion Exam is hard, isn't it?

176
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,670
Yes, it is...

177
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,070
It's hard...

178
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,320
But I haven't given up.

179
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,820
I may be depressed and stuck in a rut right now,

180
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,590
but I'm going to eat a lot, sleep a lot,
and once my spirits are lifted,

181
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,360
I'll redo my training again and again.

182
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,490
I'll keep challenging myself and retake it,
no matter how many times it takes.

183
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

184
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,710
Akari, you're also aiming
to become a Prima, right?

185
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,800
Yes.

186
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,440
But I don't have enough skill
to take the promotion exam yet.

187
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,480
I think that's why Alicia has never
talked to me about the exam.

188
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,720
Someday if I do get to take
the exam and I happen to fail it...

189
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,990
...I'm going to keep challenging myself and retake it
over and over, never giving up, just like you, Anzu.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,480
Um, Alicia seems like a
really nice person, doesn't she?

191
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,410
Yes! I really admire her, too.

192
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,850
All right! Let's get going, shall we?

193
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,910
Right!

194
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,450
Welcome. Please watch your step.

195
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,260
There we go.

196
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,730
Welcome aboard!

197
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,130
Don't worry. I'll be with you, so just relax
and concentrate on your sculling.

198
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,970
Right!

199
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,640
Okay, you can depart now.

200
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
Okay!
Yes!

201
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,300
The gondola is now departing!

202
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,590
Akari Mizunashi, setting out!

203
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,680
That girl...

204
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,540
She's good!

205
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,900
Daddy!

206
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,030
Welcome back!

207
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,260
Good work!
Good work!

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,990
And here are today's earnings.

209
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,630
Be careful on your way to the office, okay?

210
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:39,870
I will.
Be careful on your way to the office, okay?

211
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,630
I will.

212
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,670
I guess we'll clean up the gondola, then.

213
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,800
Right!
Right!

214
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,340
What is it?

215
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,120
I was just thinking about how
much you all love this gondola.

216
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,220
It makes me happy to see that you treasure it.

217
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,970
Well, we're Undines, after all.
We all feel the same towards gondolas.

218
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,090
Besides, we're the ones who should be happy.

219
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,460
Huh?

220
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,180
Your sculling was exceptional!
You have incredible talent.

221
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,940
It was so much fun sculling with you today!

222
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,470
N-No, I'm not...

223
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,680
She's right.

224
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,990
It was your first time sculling a traghetto,
but you caught on right away.

225
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,620
Even when there were a lot of passengers,
your sculling and balance never wavered.

226
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,590
You really helped us out.

227
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,790
Just what you'd expect from an employee of
the Aria Company that Grandmother founded.

228
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,930
Thank you very much.

229
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,200
Speaking of Aria Company, Alicia!

230
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,010
She's really popular, isn't she?

231
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,640
In this city, there's not a day that goes by
where you don't see her gondola.

232
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,380
Yes, she has bookings every day.

233
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,110
Your company is so busy...

234
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,710
I'm grateful she had you come assist us with
the traghetto, even if it was just for a little while.

235
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,390
I'd love to work with you again, but you might
already be a Prima the next time we see each other.

236
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,690
After all, it's only a matter of time
until you become a Prima!

237
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,100
I guarantee it!

238
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,130
Sounds nice... Prima...

239
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,870
Congratulations, Akari.

240
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,030
No, I'm still an apprentice...

241
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,140
You're amazing. Ayumi guaranteed it.

242
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,980
Cut it out, Anzu!
You're amazing. Ayumi guaranteed it.

243
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,480
Cut it out, Anzu!
Stop it, Anzu.

244
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,470
Stop it, Anzu.

245
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,520
You're already doing the best you can,
so you shouldn't let it get to you.

246
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
Atora...

247
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,190
Besides, it's not our fault.

248
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,920
It's because our examiner is too strict!

249
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,500
O-Our mentor doesn't acknowledge our efforts,
no matter how hard Anzu and I try.

250
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,910
She disapproves of everything we do.

251
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,900
If a different mentor gave us
the test, even we'd be able to...

252
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,650
But lately I've been thinking...

253
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,410
Maybe staying a Single and working
on the traghetto isn't so bad, after all.

254
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,090
Just like Ayumi, I love this job too, so...

255
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,250
Nope. You and I are different.

256
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,760
Face it. You really want to become a
Prima and tour people around, right?

257
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,440
But ever since you failed the promotion exam six
months ago, you haven't even tried to retake it.

258
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,400
Why won't you challenge yourself
and try again, like Anzu?

259
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,490
I kind of understand how Atora feels.

260
00:18:53,490 --> 00:19:01,670
Every time you fail the Prima exam, it feels more
and more like you're being rejected as an Undine.

261
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,110
It's heartbreaking, painful and sad.

262
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,700
You become afraid.

263
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,240
Before you know it, you're more withdrawn
and you start to resign yourself to your fate.

264
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,580
But...

265
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,190
But we can't let that happen.

266
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,450
If you're wound up too tightly,
you can no longer change yourself.

267
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,760
You end up unable to absorb anything.

268
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,400
You might not be able to change others,
but you can certainly change yourself.

269
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,410
If I lack the skills right now,
then I just need to learn them.

270
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,580
That's why I want to stay calm and flexible.

271
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,150
If you're flexible, you can take any shape.

272
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,350
You can absorb anything.

273
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,160
That way, I can become anything I want.

274
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,820
Yes... even the Prima I long to be.
I know I can become one!

275
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,510
But she'll just say it's too late to-

276
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,940
It'll be fine!
But she'll just say it's too late to-

277
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,840
It'll be fine!

278
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,080
I'm sure it'll be fine.

279
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,810
It doesn't matter where, when, or
how many times you've tried before.

280
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,940
It's a fresh new start every time
you wish to challenge yourself.

281
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,250
As long as you don't put an end to it
yourself, I'm sure it's never too late.

282
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,170
Yeah!

283
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,010
Hey, hey. What's this? It's youth!

284
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,570
Yeah.

285
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,950
I'll give it another shot.

286
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,090
Yes! I'll do my best, too!

287
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,530
I'll keep doing my best, too.

288
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,390
Me, too!

289
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,880
Are we sure we have everything?

290
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,210
Yes!
Are we sure we have everything?

291
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:23,580
Yes!

292
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,940
Yes!
We're fine.

293
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,180
We're fine.

294
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,740
Well then, let's head home, shall we?

295
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,120
The traghetto.

296
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,640
For some, it's a job to be proud of.

297
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,180
For some, it's a place to train.

298
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,100
All of them, moving forward
along their chosen paths...

299
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,720
...seemed to shine brightly before my eyes.

300
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,000
The path to becoming a Prima may be difficult,

301
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,530
but I'll continue to move forward, as well.

302
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,610
No matter how far it is,
I'll keep moving forward.

303
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,150
I'm back!

304
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm back, President Aria.

305
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,330
My, my. Welcome back, Akari.
Good work today.

306
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,670
Alicia, I just got back!

307
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,870
How was it?

308
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,300
It was really fun!

309
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,510
"You sculled a traghetto, huh?
I'd like to give it a ride."

310
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:33,000
"Ah, but I'm looking forward to riding in
your gondola when you're a Prima, too!"

311
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,890
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

312
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,520
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

313
00:22:49,300 --> 00:23:00,440
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

314
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,310
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

315
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:22,800
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

316
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,860
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

317
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:45,120
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

318
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,590
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

319
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,930
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

320
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,070
And my day begins
Hajimaru
