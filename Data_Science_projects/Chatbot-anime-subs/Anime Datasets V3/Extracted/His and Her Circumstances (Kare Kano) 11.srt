529
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:13,518
The first semester was about to end.

530
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,525
Finals and intramurals have ended.

531
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,132
The campus was astir with
the anticipation of summer.

533
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:34,201
The regular students talking
about summer vacation...

535
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:35,438
...and those in sports clubs
about their various activities.

536
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:40,103
Until just the other day,

537
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,207
Miyazawa was having a rough time...

538
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:43,614
...but now she's made some friends

539
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,412
and is back on good terms with the other girls.

540
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,214
Oh, Arima, good morning.

541
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:48,551
M...morning.

542
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,660
Oh, you're so cute.  What is it?

544
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:01,265
Damm, Shibahime's such a brat.

545
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:02,192
Is this for revenge?

546
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:06,004
A lot of things happened, in the first semester.

547
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:08,799
I met Miyazawa, we found
out each other's true nature...

548
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,134
...and we both decided to go
back to being our real selves.

549
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,569
Miyazawa easily demolished the me
that was the square, unfortunate model student...

551
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:18,579
...and found the real "me"
that even I hadn't known about,

553
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,178
and said she liked me.

554
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,484
I was so glad I met her.

556
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:27,053
I was so glad we're spending
our high school days together.

557
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:30,258
It's really hot these days.

558
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:32,225
First semester's coming to an end.

559
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:35,391
Yeah. Come to think of it,
an awful lot of stuff happened, didn't it?

561
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,031
I was just thinking that myself.

562
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,095
What if second semester's like this, too?

563
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,532
I don't want to think about it, so I'm not going to.

564
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,205
Man, it's already summer vacation?

565
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:47,907
Are you going anywhere for summer vacation?

566
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,380
Nah. Maybe as far as grandpa's house.

567
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,817
We're not that well off.

568
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,043
But I'll be playing with the girls.

569
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,216
We'll go to the movies and the pool...

570
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:56,246
With Shibahime and everyone?

571
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:57,680
Yeah!

572
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:00,123
I finally get to debut into the girls' world.

573
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,091
Going to festivals and karaoke-ing and all...
I've never done that before!

575
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,432
I'm so happy.

576
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,465
Maybe I should do the "kogal" thing...

577
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,293
...and bleach my hair and get
colored contacts and everything !

578
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,865
Ha ha ha ha ha!

579
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,501
How about you ? Are you going anywhere ?

580
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:18,607
Well, 

581
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:21,003
I'm going to be pretty busy
this summer, so I don't know.

582
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,516
Say, Miyazawa.

583
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:25,376
Yeah?

584
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:26,878
There's something I haven't told you...

585
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,977
What is it?

586
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,513
There's this meet in August. For kendo.

587
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,379
Yeah?

588
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,449
I'm going to compete in it, too.

589
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,293
So I have to practice a lot.

591
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,959
We may not be able to see each other for a while.

592
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,565
I'm going to be in the
Inter-High Competition.

593
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,129
So I'll be practicing in training
camp through all of July.

594
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,435
I wanted to tell you sooner...

595
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,202
...but things weren't definite
until just recently...

596
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,606
...and you had lots of stuff
of your own to worry about.

597
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:56,140
I'm sorry.

598
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:01,845
Oh yeah...

599
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:04,046
That happens with sports clubs, doesn't it?

600
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:05,624
That's right...

601
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,560
But going to the Inter-High is awesome.

602
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,691
I hadn't known you were that good.

603
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:12,825
You should have told me sooner.

604
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,027
Congratulations.

605
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,126
Well then, maybe I'll go watch the match.

606
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:17,535
Where's it at?

607
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:18,835
It's in Kyoto...

608
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:23,342
Well, I guess I can't go,
but I can still root for you!

610
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,004
Good luck!  I'm sure you'll do great.

611
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,675
That's right, this is summer vacation.

612
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,444
We won't be able to see each
other every day like at school.

613
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,074
I wonder why it never

614
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,780
even occurred to me before.

615
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,947
It was natural for us to be together.

616
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,453
We noticed each other right when school started.

617
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:45,294
We almost never went for more than
a couple days without seeing each
other since we got to know each other.

620
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:46,823
We became the way we are
now through our interaction.

621
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,167
We were more involved
than just being in love.

623
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:52,636
I realized for the first time

624
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,673
just how important we are to each other.

626
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:01,340
First semester is over.
It's summer vacation.

627
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,480
Are you almost done?

628
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:05,848
Just a sec.

629
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:15,325
I'll call you. After August 7th,

630
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:16,526
I'll be on vacation, too.

631
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,089
Let's hang out together then.

632
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:20,763
We've promised to go lots of places.

633
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,192
Yeah.

634
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,434
I shouldn't get blue just because
we're not seeing each other for a little bit.

635
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,405
I should be able to handle this.

636
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,399
It's not like we'll be apart for years.

637
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,036
I feel the same way.

638
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:35,511
We'll be living separate lives

639
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,280
for the first time since we met.

640
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:39,210
Hey, Miyazawa.

641
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:40,341
Yes!

642
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,049
Before we can't see each other for a while, 

643
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,682
there's something I want to do.

644
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,954
What's that?

645
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,881
I want to hold you.

646
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:47,850
Ah...

647
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,489
I won't do anything indecent.

648
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:50,552
It's just...

649
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,793
...we've never done it properly until now...

650
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,595
And since we'll be apart for a while...

651
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,160
I wanted to remember how

652
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,695
the girl I love feels...

653
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,634
Okay. It feels reassuring.

654
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,973
Yeah, I feel secure.

655
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:38,978
This feels so goooood.

656
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:45,282
The shape of the one you love
...the weight...the warmth...

657
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:47,949
It feels like happiness is spreading
from everywhere we touch.

658
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,347
I don't need anything else.

659
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:53,792
I hadn't known such bliss existed.

660
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,493
What a pity.

661
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,900
If it feels this good,
we should've done this long ago.

663
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:04,862
What a waste.

664
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:06,193
Well, it's hard to work up the courage.

665
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,664
When I get back, we can hold
each other as much as you want.

666
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,575
OK!  Good luck at the Inter-High!

667
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,773
Kick those juniors and seniors'
asses and come in first place!

668
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,880
The first summer since we met is coming.

669
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,685
Arima, I heard you're going to the Inter-High.

670
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,289
Here's a thousand paper cranes.

671
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,485
I can't go to root for you myself...

672
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,983
...but think of these as me
and give it your best shot.

673
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,257
Did you make all those yourself?

674
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:31,930
Yeah.  I'm in charge while you're away!

675
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:35,022
I'll keep all the parasites
away from Miyazawa!

677
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,935
I get the feeling that you're
the worst parasite, but thanks.

678
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,833
How could you?!

680
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,432
You sure you want to say things like that?

681
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,003
I'm going with Miyazawa
to the pool, after all, right?

682
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,143
Right.

683
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,075
What're you thinking, Miyazawa?!

684
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,016
With this womanizer?!

685
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,442
Where's your sense of modesty?!

686
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,684
What?  My sisters are coming, too.

687
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:57,021
He'll just be our escort.

688
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:58,381
Oh, really?

689
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:06,992
I'm going to show Miyazawa my beautiful
flesh that's hidden under my shirt.

692
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,530
My beautiful flesh glistening
brightly under the summer sun...

694
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,168
...smooth as fine china...

696
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,338
Stop that!

697
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,005
Don't say it so disgustingly!

698
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,647
Well, good luck with your kendo practice.

700
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,141
Go enjoy the hot stinky prime of your youth,

701
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,416
drenched in sweat under all that armor.

702
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,951
Meanwhile, we'll be having fun.

704
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:32,751
He's actually defiant for a change.

705
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,554
It'll be lonely not being
able to see her for a while.

706
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:37,795
But if so, 

707
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,096
I want to grow and come back as a better man.

708
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,267
So that Miyazawa will love me even more.

709
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:51,372
There she is!

710
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:52,867
Hey, Yukino!

711
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:55,380
Hey!  You guys wait long?

712
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:56,576
Nope, just got here.

713
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:57,674
Oh, good. 

714
00:07:58,084 --> 00:07:59,278
I was meeting someone on the way here.

715
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,117
Remember that I told you
there was someone I wanted to invite?

716
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,316
This is Isawa Maho. She's in my class.

717
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:04,482
Hi.

718
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:09,460
She's the freakin' mastermind behind
the class plot to ignore you!

720
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:10,927
What the hell's she doing here?!

721
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:13,323
Get the hell outta here!

723
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,325
Oww...

724
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:18,532
Now, now, it's ok.
We've made up already.

727
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,962
I don't know if I can trust her...

729
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,237
Why do I have to be here?

730
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,666
Well, it's a great opportunity.

731
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,047
Neither of us has had healthy
relationships with friends up until now...

733
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,815
...so if we're going to start from scratch, 
it's better if we do it together, right?

735
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:33,979
Damn. All right already.

736
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:35,377
I don't really give a damn about that,

737
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:37,016
but I owe you, 

738
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:38,890
so I'll at least hang with you.

739
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:41,118
Friendship!

740
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:45,864
Summer vacation's underway.

741
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,232
The first semester, with its ups and downs...

742
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,159
...has ended and it looks like
I can get to relax for a change.

743
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,928
Unfortunately,

744
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,804
Arima has to practice for the Inter-High...
*I'll be back on Aug. 5th.*

745
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:56,671
...so we won't be able to
see each other for a while.

747
00:08:57,410  --> 00:08:59,911
We'll do lots of stuff when I get back.

748
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:01,673
But I have friends now, and

749
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,445
I'm happy for the time being.

750
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,782
Since Arima's doing his best,

751
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:06,283
I'm going to try to

752
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,550
live my own time to the fullest.

753
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,486
Sena, Sawada, yo!

754
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,555
Yo!  Just call us Rika and Aya.

755
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:17,287
These two seem to be the most normal.

756
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,065
Shibahime sure is late.

757
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:31,339
Smoking is bad.  SMOKING IS BAD!

758
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,807
G...gotcha...Sorry...

759
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,046
Thank goodness.

760
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,917
Aya simply wouldn't quit smoking.

761
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,581
I'm glad we could be friends
with such a responsible person like you.

763
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:46,214
People who look normal are
often more delinquent than the punks.

765
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,286
Still, Tsubasa's pretty late.

766
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,153
She's been irresponsible lately...

767
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,593
But I guess it can't be helped.

769
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,161
Here I am.

770
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,399
So...so...so...CUTE !

771
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,738
Will you go with me to
some clothing stores later ?

772
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:07,074
There's all this clothing I want to
have you try on and model for me!

773
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:07,075
There's quite a lot of homoerotic overtones.

774
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,838
Lets start our little bonding date,

775
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:10,475
and party ourselves silly!

776
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,784
We live hiding in the darkness.

777
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,687
We are monsters!

778
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,894
We can't show ourselves to others...

779
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,499
With these beastlike bodies...

780
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:35,433
I want to become human soon...

781
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:40,639
Blow away this dark destiny...

782
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:41,704
Bem...

783
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:42,514
Bela...

784
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,304
Belo...

785
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,946
Monsters!

786
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,680
Tsubasa, you like Totoro, right?

787
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,088
Yeah. Totoro?

788
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,549
Yeah, Totoro.

789
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,159
I just saw this huge Totoro
doll walking off that way!

791
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,527
What?! A big Totoro? Really?!

792
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:00,660
You bet'cha.

793
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,931
That sucker was huge!

794
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:02,857
You want to see it?

795
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:03,758
Yeah, I do!

796
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,601
We better hurry an' go find it!
We're gonna lose it!

797
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:07,194
Let's go!

798
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:15,977
Hey, you two.

799
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,880
Heh, she noticed.

800
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:20,242
Cut it out, that's mean!

801
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,781
This is friendship...?

802
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:24,786
Thank you for waiting.

803
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,692
Here's a Bear Surprise Giant Parfait.

804
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:30,218
We're sorry, Tsubasa. It's on us.

805
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,290
Here, say "ah..."

806
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:38,192
Here, have some of my cake.

807
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,095
Have some of my tea.

808
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,338
And some coffee.

809
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,610
Whoa, Tsubasa's gone berserk!

811
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:00,924
I'm beginning to see how these four operate.

813
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,059
You four all went to the
same middle school, right?

814
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,859
That's right. Hatadai Jr. High.

815
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,232
I'm from South Shirakawa Jr. High!

816
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:10,760
Horikawa West Jr. High.

817
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,998
How'd you all meet?

818
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,800
To start with,

819
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,764
Tsubasa and I haven't been able to
get rid of each other since kindergarten.

820
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:19,037
And Rika's house is next to mine,
so we've been friends since childhood.

822
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,405
Tsubasa was really shy, even back then.

824
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,921
You're really cute. You wanna
play with some clay with me?

826
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,755
Because she clung to me and wouldn't let go...

827
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:39,521
...I wasn't able to collect any of the
other girls and play with them.

829
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,725
My school life was ruined.

830
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,167
But I'm popular,
so I still collect them.

831
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,172
Tsubaki just loves beautiful young girls.

832
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:48,606
Is it just the translation for this HK DVD...
...because that was also fairly homoerotic.

833
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:52,008
She reminds me of someone.

834
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:56,906
But, I'm honored to have met someone as
cute as you in high school, Yukino.

836
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,873
I hope we can be friends from now on.

837
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:02,754
Oh, you over there.
At least you have a pretty face,

838
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,022
so I'll guess I'll let you be one of us too.

839
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:06,148
That's it!

840
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,022
She's exactly like HIM!

841
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,521
Just like a certain guy I know all too well.

842
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:13,129
Come, my precious Mary's...

843
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,294
No doubt about it.

844
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,062
As far as we go...

845
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:17,697
...we've been together since we were babies.

846
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:19,694
Being together is just natural.

847
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:20,833
That's so wonderful!

848
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:23,172
When I tried to cut kindergarten,

849
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:24,304
Rika came with me.

850
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:25,937
And she was the only one

851
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,004
who got caught and scolded.

852
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,446
When my room was a mess and

853
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:30,782
I wouldn't clean it even when I got yelled at...

854
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,647
Rika couldn't stand to watch
and cleaned it up for me.

856
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:38,080
And I still bitched at her that
"this isn't the order the books go in."

858
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:39,954
I didn't want to go to the movies by myself, 

859
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,587
so I made her come along.

860
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,221
But when she'd invite me...
*Hey, want to go see this ?*

861
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,095
I'd say "Sorry, I don't like that kind of movie..."

862
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:47,425
...and not go with her.

863
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,833
So we have a relationship where
I pretty much take advantage
of Rika and parasite off her.

867
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,972
She just laughs...She's ok with that?

868
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:59,372
But sometimes I get to thinking.

869
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,806
Even though I'm that kind of person, 
I have a talent for writing for some reason...

870
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:06,580
...and I was really stuck up
because my essays kept making
clean sweeps at various competitions.

873
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,615
And then...

874
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,112
Aya, you're amazing!

875
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,490
It's great that you get all these awards!

876
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,222
I'm so proud I'm your friend!

878
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,621
She's congratulating
me from her heart!

879
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:22,665
How can she congratulate me from her heart
after all that abuse I put her through?!

882
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:23,966
Is she Mother Theresa or something ?

883
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,462
If our positions were reversed,

884
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:26,601
I could never congratulate her!

885
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:27,768
I'd burn with jealousy!

886
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,004
That's right!  That's what I am!

887
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:30,365
That's the kind of person I am!

888
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:31,537
What's wrong?

889
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:33,009
S...stop it!

890
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:34,637
What?  Why?

891
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,912
I don't deserve to be congratulated by you!

892
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,148
Huh? Every time you praise me

893
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:40,746
my vulgarity stands out!

894
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,917
You make me see what a horrible bitch I am!

895
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,720
I see. Aya is Goku to Rika's Monk Tripitaka.
*NOT a Dragonball refrence*

897
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:53,826
So in middle school we kind of connected
through our mischief and we got together.

900
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,632
I see.

901
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,591
But

902
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:58,061
Aya's really talented at writing.

903
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,133
She won the New Junior Novelist award

904
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,200
and is writing a serial.

905
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,672
WHAT?!  A novel, as in a book?!

906
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:05,303
The books they sell at the bookstore?!

907
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:06,372
S...she's an author?!

908
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,245
Yeah!

909
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,177
A pro... a real author.

910
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,907
I never thought a real one was so close to me.

911
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:13,943
Not really.

912
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,218
I get a short story published every so often.

913
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:17,950
I'm a pro in name only.

914
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,379
There are all sorts of people
who manage that much.

915
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,523
But still, that's a major

916
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:23,051
deal for a high schooler.

917
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,124
Yeah!  Aya, you have a gift for it!

918
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,588
I'm sure you'll succeed!

919
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,364
You're my pride and joy!

920
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,530
I told you to stop encouraging
me from your heart like that !

921
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,161
You're going to write a lot
now that it's summer, right?

922
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,266
Yeah. I'm going to try writing something long.

923
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,270
Besides, it's not like I'm the
only one doing something special.

924
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,007
Tsubaki's a star volleyball player
who got to be a starter upon joining the team...

926
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:44,940
...and Rika's always been good at Home Ec....

927
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,251
...and makes these unbelievably
small, pretty things.

928
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,076
Who knows in five or ten years.

929
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,784
Everyone has something she's good at.

930
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,691
That sounds so nice.

931
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,155
You all have things you want to do.

932
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:00,722
I've never even thought about it at all.

933
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:02,557
That's so awesome.

934
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,731
I can't do anything besides get good grades.

935
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:08,104
What's wrong with getting
nothing but good grades?

936
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,035
Well, shall we split up here?

937
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:18,777
Oh, what is it, Tsubasa?
Don't want to go home yet?

939
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,481
What is it? You want to play a bit more?

940
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,220
You're too easy on her, Yukino!

942
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,852
Tsubasa's really taken a liking to you.

943
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,729
But when she latches onto you like that,
she won't let go until the bitter end.

945
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,323
I'll tell you now that
you're really in for it.

947
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,928
We don't want to go along with her whims,
so we're outta here.

949
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,033
Anyways, don't get carried away!

951
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,335
We'll call later. See ya!

952
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:44,172
I know. I have to go with you, right?

953
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,676
Tsubasa's really gotten
attached to Yukino, hasn't she?

954
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:51,611
She usually doesn't warm up
to someone like that.

956
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,176
Well, she's having a pretty
hard time these days.

957
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:55,813
I hope being friends with Yukino

958
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:57,313
helps her get over things...

959
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,184
I heard her father might get remarried?

960
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,594
Yeah. She has a father complex going,

961
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:04,222
so she doesn't know what to think.

962
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:05,288
Plus,

963
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:07,461
she was hospitalized for most of the semester...

964
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,294
...and in the meantime her precious Arima
went and got himself a girlfriend.

966
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:11,899
Major bad luck!

967
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:14,372
She should be helped by one
of those faith healers or something.

968
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:16,875
Hey, I wonder why Tsubasa 

969
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,867
wanted to stay with Yukino so badly just now.

971
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:22,345
Who knows? Probably because
she doesn't want to be home much.

972
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:23,747
I bet it feels really awkward there.

973
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:26,942
But she WILL go home later, won't she?

974
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:30,215
She wouldn't be thinking of
anything weird, would she?

976
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,656
Yukinon!

977
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,627
Grades aren't everything.

978
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:45,834
They all have so much individuality.

980
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,898
This is no good. I'm totally clueless.

981
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,066
While I was out being a nerd
without any second thoughts...

982
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:54,411
...everyone else was finding
out about so much more.

983
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:57,006
I never even noticed it until now.

984
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,280
I feel like I got left behind.

985
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,582
Feeling insecure?
That's not like you.

987
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:06,924
But I just realized how inadequate
I've been all this time.

989
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,291
So you'll be finding out starting now.

990
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:13,561
You realized that grades aren't
the only yardstick for people.

992
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,657
That's the most important thing.

993
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,031
It's never too late to start.

994
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:19,765
Besides, you're not alone.

995
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,896
I want to change, too.

996
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:23,839
If we're going to start from scratch,

997
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:25,165
it's better if we do it together, right?

998
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:29,278
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Friendship!

999
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,481
I have friends. The loneliness
fades away just because of that.

1000
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,981
I'm not alone anymore.

1001
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:36,680
I have friends.

1002
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:41,817
Wow, what a huge bag.

1003
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:43,760
What are you going to do with that, Tsubasa?

1004
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,626
I'm running away from home.

1005
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:46,588
What?

1006
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,590
I live alone with Daddy.

1007
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,864
This woman's been coming to our house lately.

1008
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,534
She's been playing "mommy"
and trying to get me to like her.

1010
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,270
It pisses me off.

1011
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,172
Daddy says he wants to marry her.

1012
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:01,211
He never even said a word about
getting remarried to me before.

1014
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,873
It looks like he's serious.

1015
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:04,771
This got heavy all of a sudden.

1016
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,478
I've never seen her talk this much before.

1017
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:10,812
He was taken in by her because
he's so absent minded and naive!

1019
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,448
It's so disgusting!

1020
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:14,781
I won't have it!

1021
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:18,120
To top it off, she
has a son my age!

1023
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:19,821
What an indelicate bitch!

1024
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,060
Would someone normally
do that kind of thing?!

1025
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:23,832
That's why I'm running away.

1026
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:27,231
I'm sure Daddy will open
his eyes when I'm gone.

1028
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:31,573
This is a battle to take
Daddy back from that woman.

1030
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,306
But if you run away, where will you go?

1031
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,245
With you.

1032
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:41,050
I can't go along with you
that far! No, I'm going home!

1033
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,915
Friendship!  Friendship!

1034
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,385
Arima, friendship is a wonderful thing.

1035
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,226
But every so often, it's rough.

1036
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:54,213
What'll happen next!

1037
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,410
Sis got caught up in some
other family's personal problems.

1039
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,342
And our guests keep bringing

1040
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:00,585
up crisis after crisis!

1041
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,049
What happened to the
heart-warming comedy?!

1042
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,016
Next time on KareKano:

1043
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,418
"Where Happiness is."

1044
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:07,557
Where's MY happiness?
