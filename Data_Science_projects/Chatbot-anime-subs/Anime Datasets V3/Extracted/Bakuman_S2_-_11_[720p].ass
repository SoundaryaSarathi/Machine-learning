Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.80,0:03:30.85,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Only you, Niizuma-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.25,0:03:35.37,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,It's because Ashirogi-sensei doesn't project themselves into the main character.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.49,0:03:50.14,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Apparently, Ashirogi-kun is just going to be judged, they can't win the award.
