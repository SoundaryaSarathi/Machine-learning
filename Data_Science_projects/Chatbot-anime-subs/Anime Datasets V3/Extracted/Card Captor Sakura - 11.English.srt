1
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,327
To your house?

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,234
Yes, I’m having trouble with something

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,633
Sakura-chan,

4
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,496
can you come to my house tomorrow?

5
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:30,274
I’m happy to be going to your house,

6
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,635
but what is the trouble?

7
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:35,274
I’ll explain that tomorrow

8
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,453
I wonder what happened to Tomoyo-chan

9
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:43,953
I can’t breathe!

10
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,659
It’s nothing

11
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,095
Don’t do that Kero-chan

12
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:01,098
But the air in here

13
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,232
It’s just a little longer so bear it

14
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:04,769
I’m at my limit already

15
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,572
Just a little longer OK? OK?

16
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,412
It’s at the one after next so hold on

17
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:16,117
[Sakura, Tomoyo, and the big house]

18
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:33,529
This is strange. I think it is in this area

19
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,876
What? Can’t you find Tomoyo’s house?

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,047
Well, let me see

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,550
It should be in this area

22
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:48,450
She said it was right after the bus stop

23
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:51,955
Somebody will see you

24
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,621
There isn’t anybody around here

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,088
Huh!

26
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:58,192
What is it?

27
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,132
I found Tomoyo’s house

28
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,727
Eh? Where? Where?

29
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:03,626
Ummm…

30
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,901
What are you doing, Kero-chan?

31
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:08,706
Take a look

32
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,206
All of this?

33
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,349
Hello Who is it?

34
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,149
This is Kinomoto

35
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:21,848
Ah, welcome I will open the gate now

36
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,054
Eh!

37
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,081
Sakura-chan

38
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,244
Hello

39
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:56,415
Welcome

40
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,187
Hey Tomoyo

41
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,751
Hello Kero-chan

42
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,923
So, come this way

43
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,065
Woo…

44
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,695
This really is a big house

45
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:11,729
Young lady

46
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,931
Young lady?

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,677
Where shall I bring the tea?

48
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:20,337
Bring three to my room

49
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,077
Three?

50
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,284
Please take care of it

51
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,013
Three?

52
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,084
Amazing!

53
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,662
Amazing

54
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:47,166
Your room is really, really big

55
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,442
Is this your room over here too?

56
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,071
Yes

57
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:54,479
What do you use it for?

58
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,315
Eh?

59
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,093
Sakura-chan really is cute

60
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,162
Here, right here

61
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:15,129
The way the skirt flutters is wonderful

62
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,236
Ah, I am really cool too

63
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,005
Are you in the middle of making this?

64
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,948
I thought I would have you wear it

65
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,284
It looks pretty flashy
and nice Looks easy to move around in

66
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,188
But I feel sorta bad

67
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:37,485
having you make clothes for me
all the time

68
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:40,359
Not at all

69
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:45,828
I will film you in the clothes
that I make for you

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,258
It makes me happy

71
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:51,927
By the way,

72
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,771
what was the trouble you mentioned?

73
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,510
Actually

74
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,001
Oops

75
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:03,340
Come in

76
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,945
Mother, welcome home

77
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:09,679
Hello

78
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,683
Welcome

79
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:13,820
Sorry to intrude

80
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,352
I heard you came over to play,

81
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,458
so I rushed home from work

82
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,596
Why don’t we have some tea outside?

83
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,696
I bought some delicious cake

84
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,730
Eh?

85
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,363
Kero-chan

86
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,465
Cake?

87
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,534
So, let’s go

88
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,202
Ah, can you take that tea to the yard

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,476
Yes

90
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,052
Cake! My cake!

91
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,333
This aura

92
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:14,109
The cake from this shop is really good

93
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,517
Do you like cake?

94
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:16,751
Yes

95
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,988
That’s good

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,356
Nadeshiko also loved sweets

97
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,165
She said sweets went into another stomach

98
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:27,699
She would eat

99
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,501
this much cake all on her own

100
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,504
my dad said that too

101
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,105
She had a metabolism where
she wouldn’t get fat no matter how much she ate

102
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,069
That would be really nice

103
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,680
So, eat up

104
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:44,743
Thank you

105
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:50,817
How is it?

106
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,882
It’s very good!

107
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:06,336
You’re working hard

108
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,169
Yuki?

109
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,676
It shows that you have
worked at a gas station,

110
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:11,803
it suits you

111
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,234
Hello, Tsukishiro-san

112
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,148
Hello

113
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,876
I heard you were cleaning today,

114
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,013
so I brought something

115
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:20,244
Thank you

116
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,083
Well then, shall we have some tea?

117
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,748
The weather is nice, so let’s eat outside

118
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:30,822
Huh? Where is Sakura-chan?

119
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:32,389
At a friend’s place

120
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:33,955
At Tomoyo-chan’s house?

121
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:40,564
Which mean’s that mother
we met at the athletic meet

122
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,200
It’s Sonomi-san’s house

123
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,243
It’s OK.

124
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:49,174
Sonomi wouldn’t do anything
that would hurt Sakura

125
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:51,682
I swear it

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,504
You really do resemble Nadeshiko

127
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,039
Really?

128
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,474
Yes, Nadeshiko really was cute

129
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,608
Sonomi-chan

130
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,311
Hey, Sonomi-chan

131
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,588
Sonomi-chan, yesterday

132
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,793
Sonomi-chan, look

133
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,794
I want to tell you Sonomi-chan,

134
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:43,930
I am getting married

135
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,399
To Kinomoto-sensei

136
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,108
What’s wrong?

137
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,745
I just remembered something unpleasant

138
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:01,615
Say, can I call you Sakura-chan?

139
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:03,450
Yes

140
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:06,357
You are in the cheerleading club right?

141
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:07,252
Yes

142
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,822
I have heard you are
very athletic

143
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:11,688
Not at all

144
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,160
That is totally different
from Nadeshiko

145
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,094
When it came to athletic ability

146
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:21,338
she had no speed or coordination

147
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:24,669
What happened next?

148
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,848
Then Grandpa said,
for your next birthday

149
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,578
Nadeshiko?

150
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,411
Nadeshiko!

151
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,785
It seems I fell down

152
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,367
That’s dangerous Nadeshiko!

153
00:09:58,945 --> 00:09:59,741
Don’t do that!

154
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,539
I’m fine Just a little further

155
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,144
I’ll go. Come down

156
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:08,950
Just a little further

157
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,592
You’re OK now

158
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,458
Nadeshiko!

159
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:27,703
Are you alright?

160
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,138
Yes

161
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,937
I’m sorry

162
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,550
I thought an angel
had fallen from the sky

163
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,992
Yes, that was when they met!

164
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,528
What do you mean by angel?
How disgusting

165
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:59,464
Sure Nadeshiko was cute like an angel, but

166
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:02,970
Excuse me

167
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:06,641
Umm You know my father right?

168
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:07,736
That’s right

169
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,042
Umm Umm
What sort of person was my dad?

170
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,012
Ah?

171
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:16,650
Dad talks about Mom a lot,

172
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:19,691
but he won’t tell me much about himself

173
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,161
My dad’s relatives are all gone,

174
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,154
and I don’t know any of my mother’s.

175
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,365
That’s why. That’s why

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,147
Your father was a horrible person

177
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,246
Umm…

178
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:48,087
He was cool, and kind.
He was a good cook,

179
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,082
and could do anything

180
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,924
If you look at him
as the person Nadeshiko loved,

181
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,723
he was a horrid, horrid person

182
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:58,490
Yes, to mention his faults
is to say he had none

183
00:11:59,065 --> 00:11:59,963
That’s about it

184
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,125
Keep it secret that I said that

185
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,059
OK!

186
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:07,034
Dad?

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,997
A cold?

188
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:09,801
No, I’m fine

189
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,473
I wonder if somebody
is talking about me

190
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,552
Yes, and then he suddenly

191
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,448
There is a call from the main office

192
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,826
Oh, my

193
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:29,956
It’s me

194
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,925
Yes. Yes.

195
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,766
That’s a problem. Wait a moment

196
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,735
I’m sorry, this looks
like it will take a while

197
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:43,903
We will be playing in my room

198
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,173
I’m sorry

199
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,140
Not at all Thank you for the cake

200
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,245
Shall we go?

201
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,319
Sakura-chan! Let’s have dinner later!

202
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,486
Absolutely! Promise!

203
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:01,624
OK!

204
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,292
Your mother really is a wonderful person

205
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,894
Thank you

206
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,000
I’m sure my mom would he happy to hear that

207
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,071
Cake!

208
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,038
You left only me out

209
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,447
I was the only one who didn’t get any cake

210
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,477
You looked like you were
enjoying the cake, Sakura

211
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:27,979
I’m sorry, Kero-chan

212
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:32,385
I was watching you from
this room the whole time

213
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,087
Sorry to keep you waiting

214
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:36,426
This is your portion

215
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:42,563
Yay! Yay! Cake! Cake!
Yay! Yay!

216
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:43,561
Thank you

217
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:46,005
Anger over food is a scary thing

218
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:51,666
Great!

219
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:55,313
Geeze, there is a Clow Card’s
aura in here,

220
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,845
so it was sad being alone

221
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,380
Clow Card?

222
00:13:58,852 --> 00:13:59,750
So there is

223
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:01,380
That’s our Kero-chan

224
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,049
The trouble is from this box

225
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:11,624
Actually I haven’t been able
to open this box

226
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,989
Did you lose the key?

227
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,592
I have the key right here

228
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,467
You can’t open it even with the key?

229
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:18,426
It’s the aura of a Clow Card

230
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,172
It’s faint, but I feel the aura
of a Clow Card from the box

231
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:30,275
Really

232
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,039
Please watch

233
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,195
We tried to open this box of
my mother’s for the first time in a while,

234
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:45,757
and it was Like this

235
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,024
This certainly is because of a Clow Card

236
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:53,235
I thought that might be so
That is why I called you

237
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:59,738
There is something very important
to my mother and me in here

238
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:02,372
It is in the box,

239
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,306
so it isn’t as if we have lost it,

240
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,813
but it is very important

241
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,953
All right! I’ll give it a try

242
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,549
I like both you

243
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:11,822
and your mom

244
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,518
I’ll try my best to open it

245
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,284
Sakura-chan

246
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:19,324
Well then, I will prepare
to video it right away

247
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,204
But what sort of card is it that
makes a box unable to be opened?

248
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,845
No matter how much I look there
isn’t anything strange about it

249
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:45,820
What is it?

250
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:46,949
Sakura

251
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,883
Yeah

252
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,562
Shield! It is the shield card

253
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,798
You saw a barrier like thing
just now, right?

254
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,800
I didn’t see anything

255
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,367
Those with magic power can see it

256
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,501
Why would it be on this box?

257
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:06,544
Could it be the card knows that

258
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,847
Tomoyo-chan is my friend

259
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,483
No, this one has good character,

260
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,751
it wouldn’t do something so bad

261
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,253
Shield exists to protect important things

262
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,354
It tries to protect the most
precious thing it can find

263
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,186
The contents of this box

264
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:24,791
must be very important

265
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,429
How can I return Shield to being a card?

266
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:29,994
That’s easy.

267
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,871
You have a sword that can
cut anything don’t you?

268
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,375
Oh yeah I should cut Shield with Sword

269
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,936
If Shield is cut, it will show it’s true form

270
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,136
Then you seal it without waiting

271
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:45,912
Card made by Clow, lend your power to me

272
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,946
Send the power held in a card to this key,

273
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:52,085
and give me power

274
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,184
Sword

275
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,679
Now!

276
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:18,845
OK!

277
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,181
Return to your rightful form,

278
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,419
Clow Card!

279
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,967
You did it Sakura

280
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,696
How heroic

281
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:43,940
What is it?

282
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,709
I should’ve had you wear this outfit

283
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,147
It opened

284
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:57,613
Thank you

285
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:01,259
Well, I was here, so it’s only natural

286
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:03,392
Can I look inside?

287
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:04,353
Yes

288
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,033
Oh no

289
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,135
Come in

290
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,238
Sorry about earlier

291
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:18,603
It opened

292
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:19,637
Yes

293
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,137
But how?

294
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,947
The spring was caught in the keyhole

295
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:27,275
So that’s why the key went flying

296
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,828
What a beautiful bouquet

297
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,391
This is

298
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,537
From your mother’s wedding

299
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,364
A bouquet of cherry blossoms

300
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,406
Nadeshiko loved cherry blossoms

301
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:55,876
She said ever since she was small that

302
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:57,548
She would name a daughter Sakura

303
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,015
Sakura?

304
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,624
You are that Sakura-chan

305
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:25,942
Oh yes.

306
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:28,714
I will make dinner tonight

307
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,673
If you have something you like,
let me know

308
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:32,540
Yes

309
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,377
The dining room is this way

310
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:35,379
Umm…

311
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,348
Tomoyo, give me a hand

312
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:38,417
OK

313
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,585
I’m doing nothing but hiding today

314
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,061
That is Tomoyo’s precious thing?

315
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:50,394
Yes

316
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,132
What is inside?

317
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:53,562
An eraser

318
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,703
An eraser?
Why is something like that so precious?

319
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,710
Because this is

320
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,006
We are sitting next to each other starting today

321
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,314
Pleased to meet you

322
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:09,144
Don’t you have an eraser? Here.

323
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,715
If you want it, you can keep it

324
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,927
This is the first thing I ever
received from Sakura-chan

325
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:21,763
Did you say something?

326
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,958
No, nothing

327
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,142
Tomoyo

328
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:35,911
Yes

329
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,116
Take care of my portion too

330
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:41,447
Yes, take care of the room until then

331
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,920
Yeah! Make lots of tasty things
