Why did I have to lose him now?

31
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,273
Christ, why at a time like this?

32
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,984
<i>Due to the special emergency,</i>

It's no use.

00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,022
I shouldn't have come here after all.

Well, I guess we won't be meeting here.

38
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,428
I'll have to go to a shelter.

39
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,554
The unidentified object is
coming toward us.

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,564
We've got it on visual. I'm putting
it on the main screen.

41
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,140
It's been fifteen years, hasn't it?

42
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,267
Yes. Well, now we're sure.

43
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,540
It's the Angels.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,300
EPISODE 1:
ANGEL ATTACK

45
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,284
Every missile hit the target!

46
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,069
I'm sorry! Were you waiting long?

47
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:26,734
The target is still operational.
It's still heading towards Tokyo 3.

48
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,259
The Air Defense Force doesn't have
the firepower to stop it!

49
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,405
Hit it with everything we've got!

50
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,274
Mobilize all the units from Atsugi and
scramble the squadrons from lruma!

51
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,675
Forget about the budget!
Destroy the target at any cost!

52
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,955
Why?! That was a direct hit!

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,062
The tank battalion's been annihilated.

54
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,165
Guided missiles and artillery
have no effect either.

55
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,569
Damn it! We gave it everything we've
got and we're not even touching it!

56
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,504
Is it protected by an AT field?

57
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,304
Yes. Conventional weapons are
no match for the Angels.

58
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,938
Yes Sir, I understand. We'll
execute the plan at once.

59
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,321
Hey, wait a second.

60
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,186
They're going to use an N2-mine?!

61
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,157
Get down!

62
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,348
We did it!

63
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,919
Sorry, but it looks like you won't
be getting a shot at it.

64
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,114
Shock wave approaching.

65
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,724
Are you all right?

66
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:56,824
Yeah, but my mouth is full of dirt.

67
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,194
Yeah, but my mouth is full of dirt.

68
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,028
That's okay. Now then, let's go!

69
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,166
Push!

70
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,671
There.

71
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,911
Thanks for the hand. I
really appreciate it.

72
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,980
Thank you too, Miss Katsuragi.

73
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,039
Just Misato is fine.

74
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,153
I'm glad we've met at last,
Shinji Ikari.

75
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,142
Yeah...

76
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,856
What's the target's status?

77
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,826
We're unable to confirm due to
all the EMP interference.

78
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,662
It must have been finished. You saw
the size of that explosion.

79
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,129
Sensors restored.

80
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,300
We've got an energy reading at
the explosion's epicenter!

81
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,501
It can't be!

82
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:40,801
Visual display restored.

83
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,132
Visual display restored.

84
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,637
That was our last resort.

85
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,272
No effect, I can't believe it!

86
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,112
It's a God-damned demon!

87
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,526
Yes. Don't worry about it.

88
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:09,663
His safety is my top priority, so could
you get a car train ready for us?

89
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,130
The express one.

90
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,436
Right. Well, I volunteered
to pick him up,

91
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,132
so it's my duty to make sure
he gets there. See ya!

92
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,300
<i>But this sucks! I just had this car</i>
<i>restored, and now it's a wreck.</i>

93
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,300
<i>33 loan repayments to go...</i>
<i>and the repair costs....</i>

94
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,200
Um, Misato....
<i>33 loan repayments to go...</i>
<i>and the repair costs....</i>

95
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,500
Um, Misato....
<i>Even worse, my only good</i>
<i>clothes have been ruined....</i>

96
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,126
Excuse me, Misato?

97
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:39,226
Excuse me, Misato?

98
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,694
What?

99
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,424
Are you sure you can just take those?

100
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,233
Never mind about that!

101
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,070
It's an emergency, and we need a
working car right now, right?

102
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,641
And I am a government
official, after all,

103
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,233
so everything's going to be
perfectly fine, okay?

104
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,313
I don't think anyone will buy that.

105
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,409
Don't get so snotty. You're not as
cute as I thought you were.

106
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,753
You think so?

107
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:05,853
Oh, did I upset you?

108
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,480
Oh, did I upset you?

109
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,692
Sorry, sorry! You're just
a kid, after all.

110
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,991
So are you. You're not as mature
as I thought you were.

111
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,938
As we predicted, it's
regenerating itself.

112
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:27,806
If it couldn't, it wouldn't be a practical
autonomous invasion weapon.

113
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:35,010
Impressive. It appears it can even
upgrade its own operational functions.

114
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,646
And it's also getting smarter.

115
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,587
It will renew its assault
any minute now.

116
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,560
<i> </i>
<i>The gates are now closing. Please stand clear.</i>

117
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,095
The special agency, Nerv?
<i>The gates are now closing. Please stand clear.</i>

118
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:48,362
Yes, it's a secret organization under
the control of the United Nations.
<i>The gates are now closing. Please stand clear.</i>

<i>This is a B-22 Special Express departing for G33-1.</i>

<i>This is a B-22 Special Express departing for G33-1.</i>

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,829
Well, yeah... do you know what he does?
<i>This is a B-22 Special Express departing for G33-1.</i>

123
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,750
<i> </i>
<i>This train will bypass all other stations.</i>

124
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,777
My teachers told me it was important
to the safety of the human race.

125
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,851
From this point on, command of the
operation will be entrusted to you.

126
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,553
Show us that you're capable.

127
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,721
Yes, Sir.

128
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,054
Mr. Ikari, we must admit that our
weapons have no effect on the target.

129
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:19,788
Mr. Ikari, we must admit that our
weapons have no effect on the target.

130
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,628
But are you sure you can
beat these things?

131
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,189
It's what NERV was created for.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,090
We're all praying that you're correct.

133
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,939
<i>The target is still stationary.</i>

134
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,306
<i>Our current ability to intercept is only 7.5%.</i>

135
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,380
Even the UN forces are exhausted.

136
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,972
What are you going to do?

137
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,473
I intend to activate Unit 01.

138
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,811
Unit 01? But we have no pilot.

139
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,049
That's not a problem. Another spare
will be delivered soon.

140
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,756
Are you taking me to my father?

141
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,355
Yes. Yes, I think so.

142
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,668
Father...

143
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,405
Oh, yes. Didn't you get an
ID card from your dad?

144
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,777
Yes.

145
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,080
This is it.

00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,016
Am I going to work for him?

152
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,529
Of course.

153
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,761
He wouldn't have sent me a letter
unless he needed me for something.

154
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,193
It looks like you don't get
along with your dad.

155
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,196
It's the same with me.

156
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,646
Awesome!

00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,416
It's a real Geo-Front!

158

That's right. This is our secret base:
NERV Headquarters.

159
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,823
This is the key to rebuilding our world.

00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,011
And where in the heck is Ritsuko?
<i>Opening block B-26 in sequence.</i>

167
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,879
And where in the heck is Ritsuko?
<i> </i>

168
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,508
I'm sorry. I'm just not used
to this place yet.

169
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,739
We passed this spot just
a little while ago.

170
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,620
Don't worry about it.

171
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,122
And anyway, they make these systems
to be used, you know.

172
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,725
<i>Would the chairperson of E Project,</i>
<i>Technical Department Division 1,</i>

173
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,861
<i>Dr. Ritsuko Akagi,</i>
<i>Dr. Ritsuko Akagi,</i>

174
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,866
<i>contact Captain Misato Katsuragi of</i>
<i>Operations, Division 1, immediately.</i>

175
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,664
I don't believe it. Has she
gotten lost again?

176
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,199
Hiya, Ritsuko.

177
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,350
Why are you wasting my time,
Captain Katsuragi?

178
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,580
Aren't you aware that we're short
on both time and manpower?

179
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,553
Sorry!

180
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,292
Is this the boy?

181
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:09,228
Right. According to the Marduk report,
he's the Third Child.

182
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,098
I'm glad to meet you.

183
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:11,431
I'm glad to meet you.

184
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,999
Sure.

185
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,732
He's just like his dad. The
unfriendly part, that is.

186
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,766
Handle the rest of this.

187
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,441
Their first meeting in over three years.

188
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:31,218
Vice Commander, the target
has started moving again.

189
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,788
Right. Assume battle stations,
Level One.

190
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:39,526
<i>Repeat. Battle stations, Level One.</i>
<i>Prepare for ground-unit interception.</i>

191
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,827
Here we go.

192
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,027
It sounds pretty serious.

193
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,358
It sounds pretty serious.

194
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,399
So, how's Unit 01 doing?

195
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,801
It's currently undergoing refrigeration,
using the B-type equipment.

196
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,738
Does it really work? It's never
worked before, has it?

197
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:56,835
The possibility of activation
is 0.000000001%.

198
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,813
We call it, pathetically enough,
the O-9 System.

199
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,449
Does that mean it doesn't work?

200
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,985
Oh, don't be insulting.
It's "O," not "zero."

201
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,154
Well, it's just a number.

202
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:11,284
Anyway, it's a bit too late to be
saying, "Sorry, it didn't work".

203
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,064
It's so dark.

204
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,404
A face? A giant robot?

205
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,272
You won't find this in the manual.

206
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,818
This is Man's ultimate humanoid
fighting machine,

207
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,720
the first model of the synthetic life
form Evangelion, Unit 01.

208
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,260
Built here in secret, it is
Mankind's last hope.

209
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,129
Is this part of what my father's
been doing?

210
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,596
Correct.

211
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,725
It's been a while.

212
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,268
Father...

213
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,840
We're moving out.

214
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,240
Moving out?! Unit 00's still
in cryo-stasis, isn't it?

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,641
Moving out?! Unit 00's still
in cryo-stasis, isn't it?

216
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,181
Wait a second. You're going
to use Unit 01?

217
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,749
There's no other way.

218
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,809
Now wait, Rei can't do it yet, can she?

219
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,284
We've got no pilot!

220
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,550
One's just been delivered.

221
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,858
Are you serious?

222
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,461
Shinji Ikari...

223
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:21,761
Shinji Ikari...

224
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,596
Yes?

225
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:22,963
You will pilot it.

226
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,055
You will pilot it.

227
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,870
But even Rei Ayanami took seven
months to synchronize with her Eva.

228
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,572
It's impossible for him to do it!
He just got here!

229
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,442
He just has to sit in the seat.
We don't expect more than that.

230
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,510
But...

231
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:36,943
Repelling that Angel is our
ultimate priority.

232
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,173
Repelling that Angel is our
ultimate priority.

233
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,350
If putting someone who has a chance
of synchronizing into an Eva unit

234
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,875
gives us even the slightest chance,
then we have to do it.

235
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,819
You do understand that, don't you,
Captain Katsuragi?

236
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,391
I suppose...

237
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,429
Father, why did you send for me?

238
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,798
You know exactly why.

239
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,859
So, you're asking me to take this thing
and go out there and fight?

240
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,204
Precisely.

241
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:04,738
No way! How can you do something
like this to me?

242
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,707
No way! How can you do something
like this to me?

243
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,477
I knew you didn't want me!

244
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,570
I called you because I have
a need for you.

245
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,873
Why me?

246
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,750
Because no one else can.

247
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,589
No, I can't...

248
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,286
I've never even seen anything like
this before! I can't do this!

249
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,552
You will be instructed.

250
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,692
But there's no way!

251
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,830
I can't pilot it!

252
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,471
If you're going to pilot it, do it now
and quickly. If not, then leave!

253
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,513
It must have detected our location.

254
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,188
Shinji, we don't have any time.

255
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,398
Get into it.

256
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:11,966
No! I didn't come for this!
This is all wrong!

257
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,405
Shinji, just why did you come here?

258
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,771
You must confront your father and
you must confront yourself.

259
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:27,049
I know it! But I just can't!

260
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,862
Fuyutsuki...

261
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,199
Wake up Rei.

262
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,500
Can we use her?

263
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,700
Can we use her?

264
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,429
She isn't dead.

265
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,770
I understand.

266
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,040
Rei...

267
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,741
Yes?

268
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,174
Yes?

269
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:48,541
Our spare is unusable.
You will do it again.

270
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,044
Our spare is unusable.
You will do it again.

271
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,511
Yes, Sir.

272
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,884
Reconfigure Unit 01's system
to Rei, then re-activate!

273
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,445
Roger. Call off the present work,
and begin re-activation.

274
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,622
I knew it. I'm not needed after all.

275
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,227
Watch out!

276
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,906
<i>The Eva moved!</i>

277
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,006
<i>How could it?!</i>

278
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:53,973
<i>How could it?!</i>

279
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,407
<i>It broke off the right arm-restraint!</i>

280
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,543
<i>It broke off the right arm-restraint!</i>

281
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,678
No, that's impossible!

282
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,880
It didn't have an entry plug inserted!

283
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,347
It's not possible!

284
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,086
It reacted without any interface?!

285
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,154
Or was it protecting something?

286
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,621
It protected him?

287
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,090
We can do it.

288
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:36,783
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

289
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,250
I MUSTN'T RUN AWAY!

290
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,852
Let me do it. I'll pilot it.

291
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,393
<i>Cooling process, completed.</i>

292
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:47,527
<i>Right arm repairs, completed.</i>

293
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,900
<i>Right arm repairs, completed.</i>

294
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,898
<i>Cage now in position for docking.</i>

295
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,731
Signal plug terminator has been ejected.

296
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,960
<i>Roger. Inserting entry plug.</i>

297
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,579
<i>Plug fixed in place.</i>

298
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,240
<i>Connecting Unit 01.</i>

299
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,246
<i>Filling the entry plug.</i>

300
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,717
What is this stuff?

301
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,531
Don't worry. Once your lungs
are filled with LCL,

302
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,056
your blood will be oxygenated directly.

303
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,025
You'll get used to it.

304
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,506
I feel nauseous.

305
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,940
Stop whining! You're a boy,
aren't you?!

306
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,278
<i>Connecting main power.</i>

307
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,012
<i>All circuits transmitting power.</i>

<i>All circuits transmitting power.</i>

<i>Roger.</i>

310
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,045
<i>Connecting secondary contacts.</i>

311
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,847
<i>A-10 nerve connection, normal.</i>

<i>All preliminary contacts established.</i>
<i>Performance nominal.</i>

314
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,131
<i>Bi-directional circuits are open.</i>

315
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,829
Synchronization ratio at 41.3%

316
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,669
Amazing.

317
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:02,969
Harmonics are all normal.
No disturbances identified.

318
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,405
Harmonics are all normal.
No disturbances identified.

319
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,407
We can do it.

320
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,900
Prepare to launch!

321
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,534
<i>Prepare to launch!</i>

322
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,776
<i>Disengage primary lock bolts!</i>

323
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,953
<i>Disengage confirmed. Disengaging</i>
<i>the umbilical bridge.</i>

324
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,279

325
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,561

<i>External battery outlet, normal.</i>

330
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,047
Roger. Move Eva Unit 01
to the ejector pad.

331
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,564
Launch path is clear.
All systems green.

332
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,101
Ready for launch.

333
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,003
Roger.

334
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,237
Can we really do this?

335
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:11,504
Can we really do this?

336
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,698
Of course.

337
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,974
Unless we defeat the Angels,
we have no future.

338
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,202
Ikari, are you sure about this?

339
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,348
