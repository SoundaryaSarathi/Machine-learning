1
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,922
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,796
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,906
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,199
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:14,401
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:18,480
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:22,795
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,955
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:30,118
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,959
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,165
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,900
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:41,524
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,793
Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

15
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:21,024
A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge.

16
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:27,684
Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?

17
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:33,257
Katara, you have advanced more quickly than any student I have ever trained.

18
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,978
You have proven that with fierce determination,...

19
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:40,444
...passion and hard work you can accomplish anything.

20
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,342
Raw talent alone is not enough.

21
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,253
Pupil Aang!

22
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,556
Yes, Master Pakku?

23
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:48,503
Care to step into the sparring circle?

24
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,312
I figure since you've found time to play with house pets...

25
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,134
...you must have already mastered waterbending.

26
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:58,540
I wouldn't say "mastered", but check this out!

27
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,012
So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?

28
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:16,684
Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,208
Sokka, this is wrong.

30
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,640
What's wrong? We're taking a walk!

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,912
I'm engaged. It just... feels...

32
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,077
I know what you need! You need to meet my good friend Appa!

33
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:32,038
Who?

34
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,990
Appa and I go way back. Don't we boy?

35
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:36,840
Ahh! Easy!

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,203
Down boy! Ahh! No! Up!

37
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:43,161
Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention.

38
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,444
So how does this work?

39
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:47,836
You hangin' on tight?

40
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,954
Mmm hmm.

41
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,826
Yip... yip!

42
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,847
Oh... my... goodness!

43
00:02:56,366 --> 00:03:00,132
Wow! I can't believe you do this every day!

44
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,324
Yeh, we pretty much live up here.

45
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:05,625
Is it always this cold in the sky?

46
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:09,163
Not when you're with someone.

47
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,945
It's beautiful up here.

48
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:12,606
Yeh.

49
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:22,768
Whoo! Yeh! Huh... Good times! Good times!

50
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,843
Hey, look!

51
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:27,056
What's happening?

52
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh no.

53
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,593
Soot.

54
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:54,008
What?

55
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:59,865
I've seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.

56
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:00,729
But why?

57
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,414
It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole.

58
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,277
And from the looks of the stuff...

59
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,988
...I'd say there's a lot of them.

60
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,685
This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.

61
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:20,510
Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao...

62
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:24,228
...who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization.

63
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,207
You're lucky you're here to see it.

64
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:32,774
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.

65
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:35,626
I suppose you speak from experience?

66
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,669
But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

67
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,295
I hope not, for your sake.

68
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:48,638
Tell the Captains to prepare for first strike.

69
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,605
We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?

70
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,579
I'm working on it, Uncle.

71
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,159
What's wrong? We have to go!

72
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:17,234
No, Sokka, wait. I can't see you anymore. Not at all.

73
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,850
What? We're just friends.

74
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,783
I wish we could just be friends,...

75
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:25,794
...but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you.

76
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:28,635
I'm marrying someone else.

77
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,420
You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.

78
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,455
But I do love my people.

79
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:37,070
You're not marrying them.

80
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:41,414
You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe.

81
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,818
I have to do this, goodbye!

82
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:54,262
The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

83
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:59,184
It is with great sadness I call my family here before me,...

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:06,165
...knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe.

85
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,125
But they will never vanish from our hearts.

86
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:18,255
Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits!

87
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,306
Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us!

88
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:28,439
I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.

89
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,620
Count me in.

90
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:30,896
Sokka!

91
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:34,769
Be warned. Many of you will not return.

92
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:40,978
Come forward to receive my mark if you accept the task.

93
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,931
The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quite dread.

94
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:15,519
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.

95
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,758
I'm gonna make a difference this time.

96
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:05,359
Yip! Yip!

97
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,559
Katara!?

98
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:36,178
I'll take it from here, boy!

99
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:47,010
Appa!

100
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,456
Thanks for the rescue, buddy!

101
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:15,984
You have got to be kidding me.

102
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,063
Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation navy.

103
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:26,158
That means you'll all need one of these uniforms...

104
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,307
What's your problem?

105
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,928
Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.

106
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:40,541
Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.

107
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,006
When, like a hundred years ago?

108
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,644
Eighty five.

109
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,953
The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.

110
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,940
The newer uniforms are more streamlined.

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,458
How do we know we can trust this guy? Such bold talk for a new recruit.

112
00:10:54,514 --> 00:11:01,559
Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn, he is a capable warrior and I value his input.

113
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:07,411
Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer.

114
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:12,917
His name is Zhao. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.

115
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:18,579
Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn, he is leading this mission.

116
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:27,026
Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law.

117
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,823
Princess Yue's marrying you?

118
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,505
Yeh, what of it?

119
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,838
Nothing, congratulations.

120
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,840
Stop those fireballs!

121
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,478
It's almost twilight, Admiral.

122
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,701
As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack.

123
00:11:56,748 --> 00:12:01,920
The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight.

124
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:05,193
You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.

125
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:10,117
Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution.

126
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,937
But for now, daybreak it is.

127
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:21,441
They've stopped firing.

128
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,606
Aang!

129
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:32,309
I can't do it. I can't do it.

130
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:33,181
What happened?

131
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,895
I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships,...

132
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:40,223
...but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.

133
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:43,506
But, you have to! You're the Avatar!

134
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,936
I'm just one kid.

135
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,882
If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew,...

136
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:04,281
...you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.

137
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,574
I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.

138
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:13,470
I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son...

139
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:16,074
Uncle, you don't have to say it.

140
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:19,806
I think of you as my own.

141
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,226
I know, Uncle. We'll meet again...

142
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,935
...after I have the Avatar.

143
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:34,294
Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!

144
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,561
I will.

145
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,662
And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!

146
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,800
I'll be fine.

147
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,698
Let me tell ya, Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls,...

148
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:55,441
...but Yue is the finest... and she comes with the most perks.

149
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,654
Perks!? What does that mean?

150
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,897
I mean, Yue's nice and everything,...

151
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:02,220
...but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.

152
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:06,098
Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!

153
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,779
Whoa. Hang on. What do you care?

154
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:11,361
You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe.

155
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:17,138
What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.

156
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:23,792
You're just a jerk without a soul! No offense!

157
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:29,635
That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission.

158
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,535
All right, fall in men!

159
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:36,297
Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Jo in no time.

160
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,035
It's Admiral Zhao!

161
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,488
Where are they going?

162
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:21,112
They're coming up for air somewhere...

163
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:32,129
The legends say the moon was the first waterbender.

164
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:34,790
Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides...

165
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,752
...and learned how to do it themselves.

166
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:40,612
I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.

167
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,227
Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon,...

168
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:48,993
...our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.

169
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:52,883
The Spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!

170
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,408
How can you do that?

171
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,977
The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World.

172
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:59,680
Aang can talk to them!

173
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:02,670
Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!

174
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:08,103
Or, maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!

175
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:10,456
Or wisdom. That's good too.

176
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:14,538
The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.

177
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,313
How are you going to get there this time?

178
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:19,027
I have an idea, follow me.

179
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,180
So is this the way to the Spirit World?

180
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:30,765
No, you'll have to get there on your own.

181
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:36,052
But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.

182
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:54,654
I never thought I'd miss grass this much!

183
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:57,722
It's so warm here! How is that possible?

184
00:16:57,742 --> 00:17:02,008
It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.

185
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:17,833
You're right, Yue. I can feel... something... it's so... tranquil.

186
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,074
Be quiet!

187
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,441
Is something wrong, Sokka?

188
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,060
Oh no! Hahn's out there on the top secret mission...

189
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,666
...while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!

190
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:08,802
Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons.

191
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:12,116
I have a special task in mind for you.

192
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,929
What? You want me to scrub the barracks?

193
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:18,254
I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.

194
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,132
Er, sure. That shouldn't be too hard.

195
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,104
Why is he sitting like that?

196
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,793
He's meditating... trying to cross over into the Spirit World.

197
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,454
It takes all his concentration.

198
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,970
Is there any way we can help?

199
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:31,096
How 'bout some quiet!? C'mon guys! I can hear every word you're saying!

200
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,672
Is he okay?

201
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,310
He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.

202
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,455
That's his way back to the physical world.

203
00:19:58,499 --> 00:19:59,771
Maybe we should get some help?

204
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,305
No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.

205
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:07,324
Well, aren't you a big girl now?

206
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,294
No!

207
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:13,009
Yes! Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you.

208
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:28,791
I see you've learned a new trick. But I didn't come this far to lose to you.

209
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:53,325
You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?

210
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:31,666
It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.

211
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:57,731
You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.

212
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:16,346
The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today.

213
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:24,242
Aang!

214
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,713
What happened? Where's Zuko?

215
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:32,054
He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.

216
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,337
Where did they go?
