00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:07,270
''Transformed At Last!! Son Goku,
the Legendary Super Saiyan''

2
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,910
It's all completely changed.

3
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,580
Where's Father?

4
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,580
Where's Piccolo-san?

5
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,100
Father and Piccolo were right nearby. You don't think
they got caught in the middle of it, do you?

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,930
They couldn't have been!

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,610
I don't feel their Ki...

8
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,210
That's just because we've lost
our powers of concentration.

9
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,230
Piccolo was there with him!
They're not about to die!

10
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,900
Kuririn-san, over there...

11
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,920
P- Piccolo-san!

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,940
-It's Goku!
-Father! He's alive!

13
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,680
-We did it, we did it!
-Just like I told you, right!?

14
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,890
Damn! With barely any Ki left,
we can't fly very fast!

15
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,230
-Father!
-Piccolo-san!

16
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,910
-Piccolo!
-Father!

17
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,920
-Father!
-G- Gohan...

18
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,870
Hey, Goku, are you okay?

19
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,540
Piccolo-san!

20
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,900
Gohan, you must have been worried.

21
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,870
It was incredible! That Genki Dama!
Wasn't it huge!?

22
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,070
That it was. It had the hopes of everyone
in the universe packed inside it, after all.

23
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,900
I was afraid the two of you had died...

24
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,580
You expect us to bite the dust so easily?

25
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,250
Now we can head back to Earth with
our heads held high.

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I didn't think I was ever
going to be able to...

27
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,360
What's that?

28
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,270
I- I just wanted to give it a
shot once, y'know!

29
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,520
Marriage.

30
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,880
Goku did it!

31
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,880
With the Genki Dama I taught him!

32
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,890
He really did it to that Freeza with a
super-giant Genki Dama!

33
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,130
Freeza-sama beaten by that monkey scum!?

34
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,570
T- that can't be!

35
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,240
-Never!
-I don't believe it!

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,580
Goku won!

37
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,980
And we're going to stick it out too!

38
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,690
With Piccolo-san still alive, we
can all go back to Earth.

39
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,690
All right! Let's go!

40
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,850
Charge!

41
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,560
Purple Comet--

42
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,230
--Zed Crush!

43
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,280
W- what was that oni?

44
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,910
Order up!

45
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,910
Oh? We have so many guests today oni!

46
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,260
Jheese! Butta! ReaCoom!

47
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,610
Yeah, we won, we won! We beat
the Ginyu Special Corps!

48
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,780
Dammit! We can't just leave it like this!

49
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,630
It's no use, oni! It's easy to drop down here into Hell,
but crawling out is very difficult oni!

50
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,560
Nothing is impossible for ReaCoom-sama,
of the Ginyu Special Corps!

51
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,910
ReaCoom Jump!

52
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,780
You fought well! You guys have
improved more than I thought!

53
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,890
To think that you could so easily kick around those
training partners I took the trouble to call here...

54
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,550
Training partners?

55
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,890
To tell the truth, in order to give you
some training in actual battle,

56
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,800
I made a request of Yama the Great to
have the Ginyu Special Corps sent here.

57
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,140
Given their powers, it isn't likely they'll
be able to climb out of Hell.

58
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,910
Well done, well done!

59
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,350
Your training partners have parted and run
away! Your training partners have parted!

60
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,580
Good joke!

61
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Shall we go home? The spaceship I came
in can get us back to Earth in five days.

62
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,350
I'll see Mother!

63
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,880
We'll see everyone!

64
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,570
Ouchie...!

65
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,900
I completely forgot! Bulma-san!

66
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,650
Don't scare me like that! I thought that maybe
Freeza had shown up again, you know!

67
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,120
I- in some senses, Bulma-san is
even scarier than Freeza!

68
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,660
Ooh, ow! Don't make me laugh
so much, I ache all over!

69
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,100
You know, Planet Namek has
endured something terrible.

70
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,880
However, this should allow the Grand
Elder-sama, and all the others who
have died, to rest in peace now.

71
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,880
H- how is it you know about the Grand Elder?

72
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,900
What is it, Kuririn?

73
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,600
Freeza!

74
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,890
He took that huge Genki Dama head-on,
and yet he's still alive!

75
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,890
I- it can't be!

76
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,900
Goku!

77
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,860
P- Piccolo-san...
P-...P-...

78
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,870
PICCOLO-SAN!!

79
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,890
Wha...no way!

80
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,900
Kaio-sama, what is it?

81
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,240
Piccolo's been...Piccolo's been done in!

82
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,590
But I thought Freeza was
supposed to be dead!

83
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,660
Freeza is a frightful one!
More so than I had imagined!

84
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,880
Piccolo! Hey, Piccolo!

85
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,880
Free...za...!

86
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,900
Even I questioned whether or not I
was going to die this time.

87
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,790
I, Freeza-sama, nearly died!

88
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,900
Run...Kuririn, Gohan...!

89
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,510
There's a spaceship very near the
location where I first arrived.

90
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,580
Take Bulma and get yourselves away
from this planet, now!

91
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,860
Gohan, snap out of it!

92
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,800
I will fight! I'm going to avenge Piccolo-san!

93
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,140
Get the hell out of here! You guys are in my
way! Do you all want to die together here?

94
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,540
-G- Goku...
-Father...

95
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,550
You think I'm going to excuse you?
I'm not letting a single one of you go home alive!

96
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,540
Kuririn-san!

97
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,220
Kuririn!

98
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,560
Kuririn-san!

99
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,570
Stop it, Freeza!

100
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,570
Goku!!

101
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,250
A- and this time?

102
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,590
Kuririn...

103
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,280
Shall I do the little brat next?

104
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,280
Y- you're going to pay for that..
How dare you...How dare you!?

105
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,920
How dare you...How dare you...!?

106
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,290
W- what!?

107
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,920
Gohan, take Piccolo with you and get yourselves
back to Earth. He's still barely alive.

108
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,430
Go home now, while I still have
some sliver of reason left!

109
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,930
Right!

110
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Goku's fury has gone beyond its bounds.

111
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,900
What can Goku's transformation mean?

112
