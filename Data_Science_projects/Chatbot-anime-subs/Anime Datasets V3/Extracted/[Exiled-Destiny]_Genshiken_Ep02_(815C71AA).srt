Get lost.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,899
Just split, right now.

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,049
Hey, you!

4
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,619
Huh? What?

5
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,549
What year are you?

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,719
Is that you, Saki?

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:25,589
Huh?

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,659
No way!

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,069
Kohsaka?

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,799
B-But didn't you have short hair?

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,359
That was in grade school.
It's been years since then.

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,379
So, what were you listening to?

13
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:46,649
A CD by the voice
actress Sumire Matsuzawa.

14
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:47,749
Really?

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,349
Voice actress?

16
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:54,149
Across time, a reunion
that would seem to be fate...

17
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,489
Her childhood friend was an otaku...

18
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,929
Ah, what the heck does fate know?

Yeah, Haraguchi.

36
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,659
How rare for Madarame
and the others to be gone.

37
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:40,559
Yes...

38
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,789
It looks like they went to Akihabara.

Akihabara?

43
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,009
Yeah.

44
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,979
Are they buying a computer?

45
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,119
Oh, games.

46
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,989
There's that, but they
were talking about dojinshi.

47
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:08,479
What? They sell that stuff?

48
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,159
Isn't it Electric Town?

49
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,559
There's no place left that
doesn't carry that kind of thing.

50
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,029
No way, for real?

51
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,789
It's that kind of place now?

00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,069
That's funny...

53
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,369
I've gone there to buy
CDs and whatnot, but...

54
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,299
They just don't catch your eye.

Akihabara.

57
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,139
That was fast.

58

technically in the city.

59
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,419

60
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,659
Uh, I...

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,549
You said you wanted to come...

62
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,029
...so we combined this with
our freshman welcome party.

63
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,929
But Kohsaka isn't here.

64
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,219
He's with Kasukabe in Harajuku.

00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,629
Oh...

66
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,409
Akihabara, huh?

67
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,979
That's pretty damn close.

68
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,699
It's not that close.

69
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,679
Oh you're right, it's not close.

70
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,149
Why don't we start on Takeshita Street?

71
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:04,979
Sure.

72
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,049
Yeah, today I take my time.
Then I make my move.

We aren't going in here?

76
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,309
After we've wandered around, and
after the Sasahara-style main event.

77
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,609
Okay...

78
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,409
We'll take our time with that
kind of store after we eat lunch.

79
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,819
That sounds good...

80
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,249

anything today, Kugayama.

Oh, m-my voice doesn't
c-c-carry in crowds.

00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,659
That can't be true.

84
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:59,599
No, I've l-learned from experience
not to talk in places like this.

85
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,039
Oh...

00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,609

What?

91
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,019
Is it okay that you didn't go with them?

92
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,589
Yeah, it's all right.

93
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:24,989

94
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,689
Yeah, I told them all
I was seeing you today.

Huh?

99
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,839
Well, what does male-oriented
dojin-loving Sasahara think of this?

100
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,799
Huh?

00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,069
Good enough?

102
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,709
No, I'm just not familiar with it.

103
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,469
Don't worry, he loves them too.

104
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,549
Look at the speed with which he checks
those Egg Eater Sakura book samples.

105
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,419
Wow.

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,659
Embarrassment will get you nowhere.

107
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:41,099
Oh, I wonder if this folklore
look will be in this year.

108
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,339
Folklore is about ethnology, so I wonder
why it's become a fashion term?

109
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,979
Oh, that one looks good.

110
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:54,449
"Bishojo game" means
an over-18 video game.

111
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,449
But what does it mean when a
game that already has sex scenes...

112
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,849
...is made into an over-18 dojinshi?

113
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,659
Hey, fighting games.

114
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,789
This is something I
could really get into.

115
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,739
This combination is really cute,
but it's expensive.

116
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,879
This has good art, but it's thin...

117
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,669
...but it's cheap.

118
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,409
The pants are right for the bottom, but
it feels like they might be too light...

119
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:26,639
...and I could try a skirt instead.

120
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,649
The one's thick but expensive,
but since it's a dojinshi...

121
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,019
...numerous people drew in it and
the quality will range all over.

122
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,989
I must think about a
point of compromise...

123
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,159
...between design and source material
not to mention a balance with price!

124
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,329
I'll just buy them all!

125
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,769
Hello there.

126
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,099
Do you have a point card?

127
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,229
His shopping style is amazing.

128
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,039
In a way, he doesn't look
at the price in the end.

129
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,709
I envy him, but can he afford it?

130
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,979
Well, it looks like he cuts
back on living expenses.

131
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,749
Wow...

132
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,189
That comes to 123,456 Yen.

133
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,859

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,099
No, u-uh, l-I don't.

135
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,129
Pardon?

136
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,529
I-I-I don't.

137
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,229
Oh, you don't?
Shall I make one?

138
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,169
Um, n-no thanks.

139
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,269
Pardon?

140
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:24,599
N-No thanks.

141
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,569
You sure bought a lot.

142
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,739
Wouldn't it be better not to
make your dad any angrier?

143
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,839
Forget that, let's eat
lunch and kill some time.

144
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,269
Okay.

145
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,609
Where to?

146
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,239
I'd like to go to a hotel.

147
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,359
Someone I know opened a
gallery and I want to go see it.

148
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,929
Oh yeah?

149
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,419
Take my time, then make my move.

150
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,199
That clerk pissed me off,
that's why I can't stand people.

151
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,729
Looks like somebody's in a bad mood.

152
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,069
You only speak up when
you're complaining.

153
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:01,269
I'll be frank, it's really your fault!

154
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,979
S-Stuttering is
a h-habit of mine.

155
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,209
Stuttering has nothing to do with it!

156
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,879
You simply don't speak up!

157
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,319
Hey, keep it down.

158
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,649
Why don't we go do karaoke, then?

159
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,519
It can double as voice practice.

160
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:15,649
Heh, you want to?

161
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,329
Uh?

162
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,819
You sure are insensitive.

163
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:20,919
I am?

164
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,089
You don't think so?

165
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,289
Isn't that normal?

166
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,339
If you don't think so, it
means you're insensitive.

167
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,869
Why's that?

168
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,659
Think about it.

169
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,379
Your insensitivity caused us to
have this conversation in the first place.

170
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:40,809

00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,069
Who said you could sing with me?

177
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,209
If it ain't your turn, put
the damn microphone down!

178
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:07,439
Why can't I?

179
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,599
Don't worry, it's always like this.

180
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,579
I'm a little drunk.

181
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:16,049
I feel all warm and tired.

182
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:20,159
Yeah, it's pretty warm
these days even at night.

183
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,459
Time to be direct...

184
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,159
Hey, Kohsaka.

185
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,659
Are you busy after this?

186
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,269
I sure am.

187
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:34,099
I'm going to Akihabara to get
in line for a midnight sale.

188
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,759
I haven't done this in a long time.

189
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,069
It's this software that
everyone's been raving about.

190
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,909
It creates this stimulating
ambiance all around the user.

191
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:47,849
I wonder if it's also the
guys' ultimate objective.

192
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:50,849
We didn't set anything up, but
I expect I'll run into them.

193
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,679
See ya!

194
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,719
The town of Harajuku,
a date with a sweetheart.

195
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,989
Akihabara, supposedly so far away.

196
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,759
Akihabara, was close by.

197
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,999
The match is officially over.

198
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,539
Oh boy.

199
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,039
It was yummy.

200
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,009
Oy.

201
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,409
Thank you.

202
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:25,949
Ritsuko.

203
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:31,759
It's you, Ritsuko, isn't it?

204
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,469
It's me, Chihiro Enomoto.

205
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,929
When did you get back?

206
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,729
Three years ago.

207
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,369
That long ago?

208
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,269
You were gone for so long.

209
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,309
I wish you'd told me.

210
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,249
I decided there was no need to.

211
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:33,189
If I stop being a
crybaby, will you marry me?

212
00:12:56,849 --> 00:13:02,439
Let us begin the 256th "This Week's
'Kujiun' was Interesting" meeting.

213
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,379
Has it been broadcast that many times?

214
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:06,719
Don't sweat the details.

215
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:07,649
What?

216
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,549
Let's hear reflections!

217
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:13,629
"W-Will you marry me?"
S-sure was an intense part.

218
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,459
It was a bit much in the
scene before that where the...

219
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,869
...present-day Miss President won't
show her feelings to Chihiro.

220
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,029
Right.

221
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,699
But childhood friendships
sure are strong!

222
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:27,939
Why, do you suppose?

223
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,599
It's because you can't
share memories of childhood...

224
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,109
...with someone you've just met.

225
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,219
Right.

226
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,349
Also, y-y-you're so close that...

227
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,389
...the distance between you
can't really be shortened.

228
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,789
Also, childhood promises
are a standard device.

229
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,759
But in the original manga, the line "W ill
you marry me?" isn't actually spoken.

230
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,729
It's not?

231
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,129
She says "If I stop being a crybaby..."

232
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:56,069
...and the rest is
left up to the imagination.

233
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,439
Ah...

234
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,909
Then I like the original better...

235
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,139
If she actually says that...

236
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,039
B-But, I'd say the anime is
the more dramatic version.

237
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,909
I think the anime's better too.

238
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,049
I'm for the original, in the end.

239
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,089
W-What?

240
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,749
Hello and greetings.

241
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,429
Kohsaka hasn't shown up yet.

242
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,839
Sasahara, come here a minute.

243
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:37,809
Huh?

244
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,109
Move aside, Kuga-pee.

245
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,779
K-Kuga-pee?

246
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,749
You mean me?

247
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,349
You look the most honest...

248
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:46,919
...but why are you always so uptight?

249
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,749
I guess I just am...

250
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,089
Well lighten up a little.

251
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:52,349
All right...

252
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,889
Actually, it's about Kohsaka...

253
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,669
What the hell?
Get back over there!

254
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:01,869
Are you stupid?

255
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,869
I can hear you from
any part of the room!

256
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,309
Actually...

257
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:17,809
Well...

258
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,949
The other day in Kohsaka's room...

259
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,959
I found a bunch of dirty anime books.

260
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,089
W-What?

261
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:30,489
Well hey...

262
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,799
It isn't that big a deal.

263
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,229
But it's anime!
It's anime but it's porn!

264
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:41,139
You u-use them the same
way you would regular porn books.

265
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,439
It's j-just a question of preference.

266
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,139
Yeah, even we have regular porn.

267
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,149
I don't have any silly regular porn.

268
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,759
K-Kohsaka's on the same level as him...

269
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,589
Kohsaka!

270
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,389
Talk about rude.

271
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,259
But there are over-18 video games
in plain view around his room.

272
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,799
Why are you upset now?

273
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,669
You're right, when I looked again
they were all over the place.

274
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,099
Why didn't you notice?

275
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,339
Hmm, maybe they just
didn't catch my eye...

276
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,069
It's the first thing you notice!

277
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,549
Is th-this what mundanes are like?

278
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,979
Did you not notice that this room is
filled with that kind of thing?

279
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,689
For real?

280
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,879
On these shelves and in that locker.

281
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,429
Even the girl on the poster
behind you is from an adult game.

282
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,999
But this is a child.

283
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,399
You take her clothes off?
All of them?

284
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,229
You're making it sound like
it's some kind of strip mahjong...

285
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,739
Besides, she's in high school.

286
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,399
Now, now.

287
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,769
Undress her?
You rape her!

288
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,969
S-Savage...

289
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,209
I-I don't get it...

290
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,449
How could you get
aroused over this drawing?

291
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,779
Oh, there's lots of them.

292
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,889
2-D complex cases or what have you.

293
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,949
What?

294
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,949
Look, for example...

295
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,289
What does this look like?

296
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,359
A face?

297
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,399
And this?

298
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:12,899
A woman's body.

299
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,999
Yes, in this way even with abstract
symbols like these, humans...

300
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,699
...can use their imaginations
to see something else.

301
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,969
You could call it a faculty that
the human brain is endowed with.

302
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:27,719
Even looking at simple cave drawings
from ancient times tells us this.

303
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,419
They saw on the walls of their caves...

304
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,749
...the animals scampering
across the great plains!

305
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,249
So in other words...

306
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,229
...guys who say they can't get off on
anime either have some mental defect...

307
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,419
...or they're just
trying to act superior!

308
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,299
They even had pornography
in the Edo period.

309
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,129
Only being interested in
this is a defect, I'd say.

310
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,899
So, what?

311
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,799
Does this mean he has no
interest in real women?

312
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,669
We h-hear that a lot.

313
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,439
There are those of us
who do want girlfriends.

314
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,709
Well, Madarame doesn't see it like that.

315
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,119
I don't not want one.

316
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,919
More importantly, don't you think
Kohsaka's a little spaced out?

317
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:09,789
Yeah!

318
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,289
I have more trouble with his
personality than his hobbies.

319
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:14,089
Heh.

320
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,029
Aha! So you chose him not for
his personality or hobbies...

321
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,259
...but his outward appearance.

322
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,429
Huh?

323
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,769
You took one look at Kohsaka
and were smitten by him.

324
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,469
I can't understand how you
could do a thing like that.

325
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:33,309
How can you be into someone when
you don't even know them well?

326
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,759
Don't talk about stuff you don't know...

327
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,819
It's not like the first time
I met him was at this college...

328
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,129
Huh?

329
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,069
What I mean is, he and I lived in the
same neighborhood when we were little.

330
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,169
What?

331
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,709
Are you a freshman?

332
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,399
Is that you, Saki?

333
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,539
No way...
Kohsaka?

334
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,419
K-Kasukabe's a childhood
friend character!

335
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,319
Awesome!
They really exist!

336
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,219
I've never seen one before!

337
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,949
These are otaku, all right...

338
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,929
Uh-oh, suddenly she seems a lot cuter.

339
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:22,829
To me too...

340
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:27,869
I'm sure she has a cute side
beneath her rough personality.

341
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,659
I do not!

342
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,539
So, from my viewpoint
Kohsaka's weird now.

343
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,609
He didn't used to be into that stuff.

344
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,939
Well, hobbies change as you get older...

345
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,309
Was he always that good looking?

346
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,549
No, he was practically bald.

347
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:52,189
If I stop being a
crybaby, will you marry me?

348
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,559
That's why I didn't
recognize him at first.

349
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,099
Oh that's a riot!

350
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,499
Are you ready for a beating?

351
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,659
Wait wait... So, it was
"love at first sight."

352
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,439
He looked good so I talked to him.

353
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,669
At first I thought all this was okay...

354
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,609
But...

355
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:12,639
...I can't understand that kind of
hobby, and it doesn't suit him at all...

356
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,719
...so I want to make him give it up.

357
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,279
Impossible.

358
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:20,679
Even if you were to
try, he can't give it up.

359
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,489
If my girlfriend tried
that on me, I'd dump her.

360
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,749
But you don't have a girlfriend.

361
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,929
Ya got me!

362
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:34,369
Otaku or not... You're like,
the type of guy I can't stand!

363
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,299
Really?

364
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,449
It's my first kiss.

365
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,949
A kiss with you.

366
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,959
I will give you all my love.

367
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,659
Hey, what's he singing?

368
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,029
A famous anime song from a while
back...

369
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,299
Hey, what do you think?

370
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,639
What should I do?

371
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,639
So now you're depending on us for
help?

372
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:14,609
Hey Kohsaka!

373
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:15,879
Yes?

374
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,809
I'm tired of this.
Go have a first kiss with her.

375
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,279
Cut that out.

376
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,619
You want to, Saki?

377
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,679
Oh!

378
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,089
He s-said it.

379
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:30,549
That's fine, but say you like me first.

380
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,229
I like you, Saki.

381
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,589
Good.

382
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,039
T-They're kissing.

383
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,399
In public.

384
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,109
M-Madarame's frozen stiff.

385
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,409
He doesn't do well with adversity.

386
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,389
Let's go somewhere alone.

387
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,189
I know I just got here,
but I have to go!

388
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,389
Thanks, everyone!

389
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,439
"T-Thanks"?
Maybe th-that was her cute side?

390
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,839
No, I'd say it was her scary side.

391
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,799
Yes! Now we'll go
back to his place and...

392
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,839
Saki, I have to go to Akihabara.

393
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:28,609
What?

394
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,679
Sumire Matsuzawa's new
CD goes on sale today.

395
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,449
She's having a hand-shaking party at
Ishikado Electronics in Akihabara...

396
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,419
...and I really need to go.

397
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,619
Sorry, Saki.

398
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,159
See ya!

399
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,529
The train departs, leaving only smoke.

400
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,609
Distant feelings, fleeting hopes.

401
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,299
Ah, far away from Akihabara...

402
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,379
To be continued next week.

403
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:15,829
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

404
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:25,199
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

405
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:34,539
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

406
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:43,879
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

407
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:54,699
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

408
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:06,079
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

409
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:15,619
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

410
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:25,599
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

411
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:34,439
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

412
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,239
You know, there are some
things you just want to forget.

413
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,789
For example, things from your past.

414
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,079
Y-You said it.

415
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:53,959
Erasing the past, like magazines
that published your submissions.

416
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,659
You mean like a life advice column?

417
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,889
N-No, more like...

418
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,629
"Out"

419
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:00,459
No!

420
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,159
"Fanroad"

421
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,039
Y-You can't say those words
out in the open like that!

422
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:08,869
Talk about defensive...
