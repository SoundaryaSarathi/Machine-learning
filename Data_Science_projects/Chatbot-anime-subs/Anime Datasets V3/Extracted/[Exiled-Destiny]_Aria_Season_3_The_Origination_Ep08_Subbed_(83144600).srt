1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,970
Are memories precious?

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,070
Yes! I wish I could gather every single one
and keep them in a treasure box.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,210
No sappy conversations allowed,
especially in the intro!

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:10,840
Huh?
No sappy conversations allowed,
especially in the intro!

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,710
Wouldn't you want to forget
all the bad things, though?

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,840
Alice?

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,140
Athena's...

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,850
Her what?

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,280
Athena's treasure box won't unlock!

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,950
"Dear Ai, the weather in Neo-Venezia
has been beautiful lately."

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,330
"When you look up at the sunny, clear blue sky,"

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,430
"doesn't it sometimes make you feel like
you're a fish at the bottom of the sea..."

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,670
"...looking up at the water's surface?"

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,750
Ehh?!

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,620
You're going with Athena...

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,410
On a picnic?!
...on a picnic?!

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,020
Yes, we're going tomorrow.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,950
Tomorrow?

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,190
By any chance, is she
the one who invited you?

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,360
If she did, that means...
If she did, that means...

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,350
I invited Athena.

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Eh? You did?

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,960
Really?

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,270
It was Athena's idea at first. She said,
"Once it gets warmer, let's go on a picnic," but...

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,380
But?

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,650
Spring came, but Athena's been so busy,
we haven't had the chance to discuss it.

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,720
That's why...

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,420
So that's why you invited her.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,490
What was Athena's response?

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,990
Eh? Yes, well...

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,630
It just so happens that Athena
has a rare day off tomorrow, so...

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,690
Well, I guess picnics are nice once in a while.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,130
I hope you two have a fun picnic, Alice.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,430
Me too.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,880
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,950
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,340
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,140
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

39
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:36,680
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,980
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,460
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,890
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,980
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

44
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,980
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:18,760
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,900
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,500
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,380
The Memories of That Precious Person...

49
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,530
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,660
First, we'll head towards the Canal Grande.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,270
If we turn around at this point in the canal,

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,610
the morning sun should be sweeping over
Neo-Venezia. It's supposed to be really beautiful.

53
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,480
After that, we'll head to
Murano Island and have lunch.

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,420
Athena's late, isn't she?

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,430
I know! I'll draw up a schedule for tomorrow.

56
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,000
That way Athena will understand right away.

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,130
Yes, yes.

58
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,770
I'll bring two bananas tomorrow,
one for dessert and one for snack time.

59
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,250
It gets really chilly after dark, doesn't it?

60
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,090
President Maa, it's still a little early,
but let's go take a bath and warm ourselves up!

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,990
But before that...

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,840
"To Athena."

63
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,410
Okay, let's go, President Maa.

64
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,880
Oh, that's right. We need to
go to the cafeteria later...

65
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,750
...and ask them to make us
sandwiches for tomorrow's lunch.

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,990
Let's bring lots of different teas, too.

67
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,290
How about a tea-naming quiz?

68
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,760
Why don't we ask the cafeteria lady
if she can recommend some rare teas?

69
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,890
It's great, isn't it?
They gave us so many bananas.

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,930
Ah, looks like Athena is back.

71
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,130
Athena, you need to close
the door properly, or...

72
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,540
She's asleep.

73
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,640
I guess we just missed each other in the bath.

74
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,920
Athena. Athena!

75
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,450
I guess she's exhausted.

76
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,530
Dear Athena

77
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,470
She must have had a last-minute booking...

78
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,670
President Maa, leave the lunch alone
until we get to Murano Island!

79
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,510
Okay! This is now Murano Island!

80
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,820
We have sandwiches for lunch.

81
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,190
Eh? You're already full?

82
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,020
That's no good. This lunch is for two people...

83
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,520
Alice!

84
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,300
Umm... I finished... work, so...

85
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,900
W-Welcome back...

86
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,410
Um, today... I suddenly got...

87
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,010
I know.

88
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,010
Um, it wasn't something I could...

89
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,380
It's fine.

90
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,050
Um, Alice, why don't we go right now?

91
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,290
We can't go very far, but-

92
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,520
I said it's fine, didn't I?!
We can't go very far, but-

93
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,880
I said it's fine, didn't I?!

94
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,060
Um, I... I'm sorry!

95
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,860
Why are you apologizing?

96
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,840
Alice!

97
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,700
Why am I being so harsh to her?

98
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,940
It's not her fault...

99
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,160
Umm...

100
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,310
President Aria's favorite mug!

101
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,370
My, my!

102
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,780
Oh no! The phone's ringing!

103
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,250
Akari, I'll clean this up,
so could you get it please?

104
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,270
Yes!

105
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,750
Coming!

106
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,660
Hello, this is the Aria Company.

107
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,360
Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th...

108
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,230
Th?

109
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,220
This is a really big SOS, Akari!

110
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,640
What's the matter, Alice?

111
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
We were worried.

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,700
You sounded so panicked over the phone...

113
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,570
Welcome. You must be my friends.

114
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Here.

115
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,580
Thank you.

116
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,710
And one for you, too.

117
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,450
Athena's unusually quick
and responsive today, isn't she?

118
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,020
Now that you mention it...

119
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,320
On top of that, she said we
"must be her friends."

120
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,720
To tell you the truth...

121
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,160
...I have amnesia.

122
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,040
A... Are you all right?

123
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,310
Athena...

124
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,150
Athena!

125
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,380
Please snap out of it!

126
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,290
Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena!

127
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:00,980
Athena-

128
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,390
Thank goodness! You woke up...

129
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,860
You are?

130
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,460
Eh? Umm...

131
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,570
Who might you be?

132
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,600
And that's what happened.

133
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,440
And that's what happened!

134
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,190
We also have black tea, if you'd like.

135
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,520
No, thank you. I'm fine for now.

136
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,790
I see. Please tell me
when you'd like some more.

137
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,930
Looks like her memory loss
altered her personality as well.

138
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,470
My, my.

139
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm at a complete loss about what to do...

140
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm so sorry! I know it's really sudden.

141
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,340
It's all right. After all, it's for Athena's sake.

142
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,570
Has she seen a doctor?

143
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,740
Eh?

144
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,470
Ah, right, first stop should be
the hospital, shouldn't it?

145
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes! I think...

146
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,010
President Aria.

147
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,250
If you don't lose some weight,
you'll get diabetes someday.

148
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,330
Athena, his name!

149
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,370
You remember President Aria's name?

150
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,400
Yes.

151
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,060
It just happened to come out naturally.

152
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,540
Maybe now she'll remember...

153
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,910
Ah, y-you're right.

154
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,280
Athena.

155
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,150
Yes?

156
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,050
What's my name?

157
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,010
Who are you?

158
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,890
What's her name?

159
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,080
Who is she?

160
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,890
Who is that?

161
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,000
I knew it! It's really no use!

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,160
It's no use, it's no use!

163
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,330
A-A-Alice, calm down!
It's no use, it's no use!

164
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,200
A-A-Alice, calm down!

165
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,140
Athena.

166
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,270
Eh?

167
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,140
What is it, Alicia?

168
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,750
She remembered again!

169
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,020
She recognizes Alicia!

170
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,660
What kind of magic did you use?

171
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,460
Wow...

172
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,430
My, my. Did it seem like magic?

173
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,870
It's nothing to worry about. I'm sure
it's just a temporary memory mix-up.

174
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,140
In the meantime, why don't you stay with
her today and see if she gets any better?

175
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,270
If she doesn't, we'll take her
to the hospital tomorrow.

176
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,350
How does that sound?

177
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,520
Y-Yes, we'll do that.

178
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,050
Well then, I'm off to work.

179
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,380
Have a good day!

180
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,350
Thank you very much, Alicia.

181
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,870
Somehow, I feel much better now.

182
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,890
Yeah.

183
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,670
Hey, why don't we take her
to places she knows?

184
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,730
You're right.

185
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,550
Instead of staying in this room,
Athena might recover faster elsewhere.

186
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,510
I'll keep you two company!

187
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm sure she'll remember lots of things
if we go to places she's used to.

188
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,990
What is it?

189
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,120
Now that I've calmed down,
I just had a scary thought.

190
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,860
Right now, Athena is quick,
responsive, and isn't clumsy at all.

191
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,830
Maybe it's actually okay if
her memory doesn't come back...

192
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,830
You know that's not right...

193
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,880
The shop we're headed to now
serves lots of different hot chocolates.

194
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,550
Really? I'm looking forward to it!

195
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,720
On top of that, Athena is a regular,
so they have a special menu just for her.

196
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,190
Athena, have you remembered anything?

197
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,100
No...

198
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,800
I... see...

199
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,210
Welcome. Would you like the usual?

200
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,480
Yes. We'll also have this, this... and this please.

201
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,510
They all look so delicious!

202
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
That's really correct!

203
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,590
Ah, it is?

204
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,930
That's amazing, Athena!

205
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,460
Thank you.

206
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,940
President Maa, say pretty please.

207
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,570
Athena!

208
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,700
You recognize President Maa!

209
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,250
Do you remember me?

210
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,180
Now, now. Easy now, easy...

211
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,020
That was delicious!

212
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,420
Where shall we go next?

213
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,070
This isn't working!

214
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,140
We're going back to Orange Planet!

215
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,500
Huh?

216
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,670
Is our walk over already?

217
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,010
I'm going to try and jog her memory
in a more familiar setting.

218
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,650
My, Athena!

219
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,350
You finally have a day off,
and you're not going out?

220
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,520
Please have your friend make herself at home!

221
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,090
Who was that person just now?
Please have your friend make herself at home!

222
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,680
Please have your friend make herself at home!

223
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,390
Athena, just concentrate on one thing at a time.

224
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,020
Out of all of these...

225
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,340
Athena, which one is your
favorite oar that you always use?

226
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,740
Wow, this is really hard!

227
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,580
Th-That's correct...

228
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,950
That's amazing!

229
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,020
You're recovering slowly but surely, Athena!

230
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,460
Thank you, Akari.

231
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,630
Amazing! You remembered my name!

232
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,290
Umm...

233
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,290
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,540
Ah, I know! How about this?

235
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,810
I'm sure Alicia will be back soon,
so why don't we all go to the Aria Company?

236
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,620
I'm sorry for asking you to
carry President Aria, Athena.

237
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,560
It's all right. I like the way President Aria feels.

238
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,670
What's the matter? Are you all right, Alice?

239
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm the only one Athena doesn't remember...

240
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,710
Athena?

241
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,250
What kind of person was I to you?

242
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,880
You were a very clumsy mentor...

243
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,020
As your roommate, you always used to
trouble me with your constant mistakes...

244
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,440
I guess you hated me, huh?

245
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,470
Ah! I didn't hate you...

246
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,940
Then, did you like me?

247
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,040
If I had to choose one or the other,
I guess it'd be the latter...

248
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,390
Alice...

249
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,010
Don't you think that's enough, Athena?

250
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,530
Alicia!

251
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,570
Right, Athena?

252
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,240
Yeah.

253
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,350
I'm sorry, Alice.

254
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,920
I was lying.

255
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,980
Huh?

256
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,200
My amnesia was all a lie.

257
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,930
Huh?

258
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,290
Wha?

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,030
What?!
What?!

260
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,450
I'm always causing you trouble
because I'm so clumsy, right?

261
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,510
Yes.

262
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,690
After what happened this morning, I thought
you might have finally gotten fed up with me.

263
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,950
I became really worried...

264
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,620
So I wanted to know how you truly felt...

265
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,850
That's why...

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's why I thought, if I got amnesia,

267
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,030
I'd be able to ask how you felt
about me and get an honest answer...

268
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,730
I'm really sorry.

269
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,080
Athena...

270
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,440
Yes?

271
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,710
Next time, please don't be so
sneaky about it. Just be direct.

272
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,980
Okay.

273
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,460
Athena, I...

274
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,000
...really hate that about you!

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,830
Ehh?!

276
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,920
My, my.
Ehh?!

277
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,440
First of all, if you can be graceful
like that, then be that way all the time!

278
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,130
But it's really exhausting to act like that...

279
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,980
Alicia, by any chance...

280
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,310
...did you know right from the start?

281
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,520
It's only because I've seen Athena pull some
unbelievable stunts from time to time.

282
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,790
Were you surprised?

283
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,420
Yes, I was really surprised.

284
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,390
It never occurred to me that someone
like Athena, one the Three Great Water Fairies,

285
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,290
would worry about things like that...

286
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,430
We're just like any other girls, after all.

287
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,340
We all wonder how the people
we hold dear feel about us...

288
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,180
...and we worry about it, sometimes.

289
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,950
Especially if it's our cute apprentices.

290
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
Let's go home.

291
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,620
Okay...

292
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:04,820
C'mon Athena.
Okay...

293
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,250
C'mon Athena.
Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?

294
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,720
Wait, Alice!
Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?

295
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,280
Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?

296
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,160
That's a secret.

297
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,430
Huh?
That's a secret.

298
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,420
Huh?

299
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:25,030
"Ai, when you like someone, that feeling
might bring an equal amount of worry, too."

300
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:32,940
"Akari, I'm sure that after this incident,
Alice and Athena will become even closer."

301
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,020
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

302
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:46,690
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

303
00:22:49,460 --> 00:23:00,610
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

304
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:09,480
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

305
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:22,960
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

306
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,030
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

307
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:45,290
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

308
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,760
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

309
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:57,090
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

310
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,430
And my day begins
Hajimaru
