1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,080
"Shen Long, Run Yourself Through Space!!
The Time of Namek's Destruction Draws Near"

2
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,210
Enough with the false bravado!

3
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,820
The only thing that remains
for you is death!

4
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,440
Before you die, there is one point
I will praise you for.

5
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Your superb, incredible strength, Super Saiyan.
It's certainly the greatest in the universe.

6
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,460
If only l, Freeza, weren't around!

7
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,490
Miserable idiot!

8
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,160
If you had only beaten Freeza before he attained
full power, this wouldn't be happening.

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,830
Kaio-sama? Kaio-sama? This is the
Kami over Earth. Kaio-sama?

10
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,160
I hear you. Something I can do?

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:27,670
I have just received word from Mister Popo.
He has located where the last Dragonball is.

12
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,840
Yes, and... ?

13
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,520
Ah, right. Very shortly, all seven
will be gathered together,

14
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,190
and so we will be resurrecting Tenshinhan
and Yamucha there with you.

15
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,520
Ah, that's right.

16
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,860
But, as I said earlier,
unfortunately for Chaozu...

17
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,870
Don't worry, Chaozu.

18
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,870
I will remain here too. We're always
together, aren't we?

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,550
You can't! Ten-san, that won't do!

20
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,880
If you guys are going to remain here,
then as far as I'm concerned...

21
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,820
What are you saying!? You have
Bulma waiting for you, don't you?

22
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,820
Y- Yeah, but...

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,530
Wait a second! Hold on, hold on!

24
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,500
Say, Kami of Earth, can those Dragonballs
resurrect two people at the same time?

25
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,170
Hm? Er, yes, so long as the conditions
are the same. For example,

26
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,170
as we are to ask this time, "Please return
to life those who were killed by
Vegeta and his group..."

27
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,850
So long as the request is made in this manner,
it will likely work on any number of people.

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,510
Then even with only the one wish, they
surpass Planet Namek's Dragonballs.

29
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,860
Okay then, can the wish be granted
even on worlds far separated from Earth?

30
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,860
Mm, probably. Why do you ask such a thing?

31
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,540
You can't be thinking of bringing
back to life all the aliens Vegeta
has ever killed in the past, can you?

32
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,640
Naturally, such a thing is possible, but it
would only be effective for those who
had died within one year's time.

33
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,280
There's just one more thing I'd like to ask.

34
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,810
Can those who died having lived
the full measure of their life be resurrected?

35
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,820
Unfortunately, that is impossible. In the
event of a natural death...

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,830
But what about the case of someone who met
with evil beings, and even though indirectly,

37
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,500
had their life's measure reduced as a result?

38
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,510
A good question indeed.
This is a first-time case.

39
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,840
But I believe they would be able to live
for the portion of time that had been
shortened from their measure.

40
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,520
I have no proof of such, however.

41
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,850
Kaio-sama, what is it?

42
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,630
All right, it's decided then! Kami,
change that wish for me!

43
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,810
Make it, Please return to life all those
killed by Freeza and his ring, okay?

44
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,480
Aren't we to Son-kun's spaceship yet?

45
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,490
If we don't get off this dangerous planet
as soon as possible, we'll never set
foot on the soil of Earth again!

46
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,820
Yes, I know that.

47
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You're really sure about that? Yet you
don't even know how hard I had
to struggle up until now!

48
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,840
But I do know.

49
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,840
It was so awful, after all! Being
chased by dinosaurs,

50
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,170
getting changed into a frog, almost
getting pinched by giant rocks... !

51
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,860
There it is! That's it! That's
Father's spaceship!

52
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,520
Hooray! Now we can return to Earth!

53
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,810
Hey, hold on! Where are you
going on your own!?

54
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,870
The lifespan of this planet is nearly up.
Two or three minutes left at the outside.

55
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,510
You must be getting anxious,
eh Super Saiyan?

56
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,850
So that's it, you're buying time, are you? Enough for
that kid and the others to leave this planet?

57
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,800
Well, that's okay. I may let them go now,
but I will make them my next target.
Their deaths will only be slightly delayed.

58
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Buying time, did you say?
I don't have the need to!

59
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,800
You're going to die. Here and now.

60
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,170
That's enough of your big talk! I'm
going to shut you up right now!

61
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,510
What's taking so long for Gohan
and the others? Get moving!

62
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,530
Killed by Freeza and his ring, you say?
Kaio-sama, what is this about?

63
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,410
There isn't any time, so
I'll explain this simply.

64
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:59,090
First, we use the Dragonballs on Earth to
return to life those killed by Freeza and
his men, meaning the Namekians.

65
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,090
By doing so, it is likely that the
Grand Elder of Planet Namek will
be resurrected, however briefly.

66
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:12,430
From that point, I'm not too sure this
is going to work myself, but of the
Namekian Dragonballs' three wishes,

67
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:21,110
only two have been granted. Once the Grand
Elder is returned to life, there should be
one more wish to be granted.

68
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,370
A- And then?

69
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:34,060
With one wish, instantaneously relocate
all those on Planet Namek, except Freeza,
to someplace like Earth!

70
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,050
l- I see. That is one possible gamble, isn't it?

71
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,060
You guys' resurrections will be considerably
delayed. Can you put up with that for us?

72
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,400
I can't return to life in the first place, so...

73
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,410
Of course, that will be fine with
me! It's only one year, isn't it?

74
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,410
It is an excellent idea you have, Kaio-sama!

75
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,080
And that's that. Now pardon me,
but you must hurry!

76
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,080
The very planet Namek itself is just
about to be vaporized!

77
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:15,090
Is that so? Very well, I will tell this
to Mister Popo right away.

78
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:58,500
- Bulma-san, come inside, quick!
- What's going on? It's pitch black
in here! It can't be malfunctioning.

79
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,070
That's strange. When I was here
earlier, the lights were on.

80
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,400
W- Watch out!

81
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,070
The floor is slanted.

82
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm not familiar with this thing,
but I'll try this and that.

83
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,750
Could this be it?

84
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,440
l- Isn't that Piccolo over there!?

85
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,770
Yes, it is.

86
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,450
What's he doing in a place like this?
I don't want to journey through space
together with someone like Piccolo!

87
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:03,470
Piccolo-san helped save me and Father, so I am
going to be sure to take him back to Earth!

88
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:14,150
You know, Gohan-kun, this is Piccolo's homeland.
I wonder if he wouldn't rather like to stay here.

89
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,140
O- Okay, already!

90
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,760
Well, what else can I do? He's unconscious and all,
so there's nothing to worry about, right?

91
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,790
What!?

92
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,260
We've reached the limit! If we stay here
any longer, we won't be able to take off!

93
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,070
You can't! Father still hasn't come!

94
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,410
Son-kun will be fine! He's sure to
escape somehow or other!

95
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,420
Please, Bulma-san! For Father!
Wait for Father, please!

96
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,420
Just one more minute will be enough!

97
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,760
G- Gohan-kun...

98
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:11,460
Hold out against this, Piccolo! If you and I
die now, all hope will disappear as well!

99
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,120
Kami-sama! Kami-sama!

100
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,740
Kami-sama, Dragonballs gathered.
Can say wish any time.

101
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,740
Very well!

102
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:37,070
So, speak forth thy wish! I shall
grant thee any one wish!

103
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,040
Um, want to have those killed by
Freeza and his men returned to life.

104
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,750
This on distant planet. Can you grant wish?

105
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,420
I know not. However, I shall try.

106
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,100
Not know is trouble. Can only have
do. Request this. Good luck.

107
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,650
Go to hell, Freeza!

108
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,390
What will be the outcome of this, the
greatest conflict in the universe?

109
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,720
And will the wish to Shen Long be granted?

110
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,790
There is no more time remaining!
