1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,330
What is this warm light?

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,733
Am I the princess? What should I do?

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:12,329
I don't know! I don't know what to do!
What can I do?!

4
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:17,941
Tuxedo Mask, everyone,
please help me!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

6
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

7
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

8
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

9
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

10
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

11
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same
land, miracle romance

13
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

14
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,467
Mamoru was badly injured,
trying to protect Usagi!

15
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,207
Then the rainbow crystals
reacted to Usagi's tears

16
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,232
and turned into the legendary
Silver Crystal.

17
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:08,406
I never imagined that Usagi
was the princess!

18
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,683
But there's no doubt about it.

19
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,052
This warm aura around her...

20
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:17,749
She's the Moon Princess!
She's finally awakened!

21
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:31,701
Memories Return!
Usagi and Mamoru's Past

22
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:53,886
Sailor Moon...

23
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,123
Princess... Princess Serenity...

24
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,869
What?!

25
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,404
Princess?!

26
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:10,636
Then Sailor Moon was the princess
we've been looking for?

27
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:19,506
And the true identity of
Tuxedo Mask was Mamoru.

28
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:28,124
The princess has awakened.

29
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:32,130
In that case, I'll just kill you and
take the Silver Crystal!

30
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,222
Zoi!

31
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,501
What?!

32
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,137
Tuxedo Mask...

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,150
All this for me...

34
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,020
Serenity...

35
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,195
I remember everything now.

36
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:08,097
Serenity, I am Endymion.

37
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,500
Endymion...

38
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:19,043
Now, I know. I am Serenity!

39
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,219
Endymion!

40
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,088
Endymion!

41
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,729
Endymion...

42
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,759
So, you're Endymion.

43
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,971
Endymion...

44
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,314
Sailor Moon!

45
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:45,427
She's all right. She just fainted.

46
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,091
Thank goodness.

47
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,767
Her memories of when she
was the princess

48
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,964
probably came back to her
and overwhelmed her.

49
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,501
Mamoru, please wake up!

50
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,736
He's badly injured.

51
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,610
This is nothing...

52
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,993
Master Kunzite...

53
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,365
Master Kunzite,

54
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:23,766
Sailor Moon is the Moon Princess.

55
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,372
I see. So the princess awoke,

56
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,670
and the rainbow crystals
were drawn to her.

57
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:45,017
I will allow you to live for
a while longer yet.

58
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:54,524
What?!

59
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,400
What did he mean by that?

60
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:08,613
You allowed the Moon Princess
to awaken

61
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,949
and lost the Silver Crystal as well.

62
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,076
That was poorly executed, Kunzite.

63
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,287
My lady, I am very sorry.

64
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,357
However, the princess has
just now awoken

65
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,026
and has yet to fully master the use
of the Silver Crystal.

66
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,028
I would ask that you wait
a while longer.

67
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,191
Very well. I will leave it to you.

68
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,193
By the way, Zoisite, I hope you
are ready to face your fate.

69
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:34,872
Please wait. Just one more chance.

70
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:39,510
You tried to kill Tuxedo Mask
against my orders, did you not?!

71
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,145
But I...

72
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:44,082
Did you think you could fool me?!

73
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:46,141
I will take responsibility for that.

74
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,913
Please wai...

75
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,684
Master Kunzite!

76
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,289
Clean up that mess!

77
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:00,825
Yes, my lady.

78
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:09,674
My great ruler, Queen Metalia,
please awaken.

79
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:19,006
Endymion, I have so longed
to see you.

80
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,855
He was once the prince of the Earth.

81
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:27,188
To think he had transmigrated
into this world somehow.

82
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:33,288
Use the power of darkness to restore
Endymion immediately.

83
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,023
Yes, my lady.

84
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,040
I am sorry, Zoisite.

85
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,703
I tried to ask Queen Beryl
to revive you, but...

86
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,886
I am happy.

87
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,548
For I will die in your arms.

88
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,056
But please grant me my last wish.

89
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:04,990
What is it?

90
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:08,764
I want to die beautifully.

91
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,877
How beautiful.
I am so happy, Master Kunzite.

92
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:33,854
I loved you, Master Kunzite.

93
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,958
Forgive me, Zoisite.

94
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,869
Is there really an exit around here?

95
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,739
There is definitely a way out,

96
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,879
but it's a little troublesome.

97
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,642
What do you mean?

98
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,483
This dimension is apparently
an imaginary space

99
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,348
that's been sealed off.

100
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,056
In short, theoretically, the real
dimension we were in

101
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,793
is not directly connected to the
three-dimensional space here.

102
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,461
Instead, they should be connected
only in two-dimensional space

103
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,029
with the positive and negative
phases reversed

104
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,192
and passing through
zero-dimensional space.

105
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,460
Anyway, can you hurry up?

106
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:54,940
I guess we can only depend
on Sailor Mercury now.

107
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,675
We're counting on you.

108
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:59,912
We can't just hang around
here forever.

109
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,072
I know.

110
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,618
Sailor Moon.

111
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,316
It looks like you're awake.

112
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,356
Tuxedo Mask!

113
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,994
Where? Where? Where is he?! Tell me!

114
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,808
He couldn't have...

115
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:31,400
He's alive!

116
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,875
Really?

117
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:37,342
But he was taken by our enemy.

118
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,574
By our enemy?

119
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,782
I see.

120
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,624
Everyone, please listen to me!

121
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,894
Now that the princess has awakened,

122
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,963
I think it's time to tell you everything.

123
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:53,232
Luna, all your memories came back

124
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,801
when the princess awoke, too, right?

125
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,359
Yes, it's all clear now.

126
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,301
Wait a minute!
What are you talking about?

127
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:03,308
About our previous lives.

128
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:07,210
And about the moon kingdom
called, Silver Millennium.

129
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,375
Long, long ago,

130
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:16,051
there was a kingdom on the moon
called, Silver Millennium.

131
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:20,124
It was a very peaceful paradise.

132
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:55,426
Around that time, the Earth was
taken over by an evil spirit!

133
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:06,505
It invaded Silver Millennium
in order to try and obtain

134
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:09,702
the enormous power of
the Silver Crystal.

135
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:16,615
The kingdom was destroyed
in the fierce war,

136
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,984
but with the power of
the Silver Crystal,

137
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:21,384
they sealed away the evil spirit!

138
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:28,549
You are those four warriors who
fought back then, now reborn.

139
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:33,160
Then, are we people of the moon?

140
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:37,269
No, we're all genuine Earth humans.

141
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,602
So your parents are
really your parents.

142
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,307
You see, the queen of the moon

143
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:44,443
wanted the princess and
the rest of you

144
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:48,113
to live happily as normal girls,

145
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:52,351
so she transmigrated you to
this most peaceful era.

146
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,885
But even in this era,

147
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,615
someone unraveled the seal
on the evil spirit.

148
00:13:57,556 --> 00:14:01,287
So, that evil spirit is the leader
of the Dark Kingdom?

149
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,896
That's right. If none of this
had happened,

150
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:09,901
all of you would be living
happily as normal girls.

151
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:13,338
But if we don't protect the Silver
Crystal and defeat our enemy,

152
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,772
we cannot have a peaceful world.

153
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,643
And our duty is to fight
for that cause!

154
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,178
You understand, don't you?

155
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,681
We have to work together and fight

156
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:26,318
so we don't repeat the tragedy
of the past again.

157
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:27,452
I understand.

158
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,579
Yes, let's fight together!

159
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:32,450
I don't want to.

160
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,554
Sailor Moon...

161
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,529
I just don't want to fight anymore.

162
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:41,967
Are you serious?

163
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,162
But I just don't want to!

164
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,299
You're the princess!
How could you say that?!

165
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:50,942
Being told I'm the princess doesn't
make me feel like one,

166
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,345
and it doesn't make me happy at all!

167
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,614
I'm just Usagi Tsukino.

168
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:59,117
Usagi, don't you understand
what your mission is?!

169
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,720
I don't care about any
mission anymore!

170
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,822
So what about my previous life?!

171
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,791
It has nothing to do with me!

172
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,727
What's with all of you?!
I just don't want to fight anymore!

173
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,698
If everyone...

174
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,697
If everyone ends up like Mamoru...

175
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:24,401
I don't want to see that! It's too sad!
I don't want this!

176
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,077
Ouch...

177
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:36,621
You're a coward... A coward!
You're a coward!

178
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:41,024
Yes, I'm a coward.
I'm not strong like you are, Rei!

179
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:47,126
Rei...

180
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,265
Mamoru did all that just to protect
a coward like you...

181
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:59,244
Sailor Moon still needs
some more time.

182
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,472
But...

183
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,516
She'll go back to being the
same old Usagi in a while.

184
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,314
Until then, let's all watch over her.

185
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,724
By the way, Luna, I found the exit!

186
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:15,827
Good! Then, I know we're still
not done talking,

187
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,795
but let's get out of here first!

188
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:19,587
Come on, let's go!

189
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,268
I am surprised you found the exit.

190
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:40,085
Luna, Artemis, find someplace safe!

191
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,353
Okay!

192
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,684
Be careful, Venus!

193
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:46,858
Everyone, take care of the princess!

194
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,224
I'm going to fight with you!

195
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,663
Thank you.

196
00:16:51,663 --> 00:16:53,131
You are wasting your time.

197
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,598
Don't underestimate me!

198
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,328
Supreme

199
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,064
Thunder!

200
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:10,610
No way! He's absorbing the energy!

201
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,219
How about this?!

202
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:17,950
Crescent Beam!

203
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:24,095
It's not working.

204
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:28,259
In this dimension, he'll absorb
all the energy!

205
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,260
Then, what should we do?!

206
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:39,578
That's not enough...

207
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,637
...to defeat us!

208
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,640
Then, die!

209
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,850
Watch out!

210
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,960
Take care of the rest, Mercury!

211
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:12,076
Usagi, wake up.

212
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:14,913
You will be fine, I know it!

213
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,574
Are you ready?

214
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:20,211
Fire

215
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,351
Soul!

216
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,951
Fool!

217
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,969
Are you ready, Princess?

218
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:49,347
I am your opponent!

219
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,281
Do not interfere!

220
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,242
Tenacious fool!

221
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,684
Ami, hang in there!

222
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,355
Usagi, be brave!

223
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:07,465
Ami...

224
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:10,525
Usagi, be strong.

225
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:12,933
Usagi...

226
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:15,365
Usagi...

227
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,743
Everyone... Everyone...

228
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,578
Everyone...

229
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:30,386
Tuxedo Mask, please
lend me your power.

230
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:32,389
Sailor Moon...

231
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:34,990
Tuxedo Mask?

232
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,730
Fight, Sailor Moon!
The Silver Crystal...

233
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,493
Raise the Silver Crystal!

234
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,595
Yes!

235
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,731
Do you mean to step into Hell
voluntarily, Princess?

236
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:51,839
Fine, then.

237
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:56,043
I will take revenge for Zoisite!

238
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,984
Please...

239
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,753
Please, Silver Crystal!

240
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,626
What?!

241
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,327
That girl...

242
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,888
So, she has learned to use some
of the Silver Crystal's power.

243
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,567
Serenity...

244
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:02,138
Endymion, can you still not
forget about her?

245
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,383
Even though it will be
forever unrequited,

246
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,851
no matter how much
you love Serenity.

247
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:19,458
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask.

248
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,759
You saved us.

249
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:28,201
Thank you, Sailor Moon!

250
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:32,943
You'll fight with us, won't you?

251
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,710
Everyone...

252
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:37,949
Yes!

253
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:40,852
Looks like we've cleared
the first hurdle.

254
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,820
You did a good job, Usagi!

255
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:49,294
Let's all keep working together
and do our best!

256
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:52,730
As long as we do, we'll be able
to overcome any hardship!

257
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,769
Yes.

258
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,603
And Tuxedo Mask is certainly
alive somewhere, too.

259
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:15,241
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

260
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:18,890
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

261
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:26,592
It's a world no one knows about

262
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,495
With white shoes clicking

263
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:34,305
Cross the white moon bridge

264
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:42,405
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

265
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:49,049
Offer a prayer to the moon

266
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:57,790
It will surely bring you happiness

267
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:04,998
Go round and round,
the moon's merry-go-round

268
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:13,273
Make that serene dress made of glass
flutter in the wind

269
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:20,818
She's always watching over us

270
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:27,348
Moon, moon princess
