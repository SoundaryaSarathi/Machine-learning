1
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,270
Inside of me... you've always been crying.

2
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,100
"I want to wipe your tears away" is what I think.

3
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,070
But... I do not know what your soft, warm face will look like after the tears are wiped away.

4
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,270
Argh, it didn't come out the way I wanted!

5
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,660
I really want to draw a more gentle smile...

6
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,620
What are you doing?

7
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,420
It seems that there weren't enough people to do this work.

8
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,970
I see...

9
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,030
You aren't going to eat?

10
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,930
Once I'm done with this.

11
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,210
Ah, I see.

12
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,940
"Ah, I see"... What am I saying?!

13
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,500
What am I doing trying to look cool?!

14
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,480
Umm, Bo-chan?

15
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,620
Err... I'm stretching, stretching...

16
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,430
Stretching.

17
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,430
Stretching... that's good.

18
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,870
Where's Dad?

19
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,330
Looks like he's still at work.

20
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,880
How's that girl?

21
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
Working on the records.

22
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,700
If she doesn't help me finish it, I won't have time to take care of the dishes.

23
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,400
Well, you shouldn't be saying that. After all, she's helping you with chores.

24
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,830
So you're also on her side.

25
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,050
That's not how it is.

26
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,280
I don't want to hear it.

27
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,380
Damn, what's with that?

28
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,790
"An angel exists somewhere..."

29
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,510
"Only if we could save up your tears,"

30
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,190
"And then, make a necklace out of them..."

31
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,550
"We could hang it on the tree."

32
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,030
"The tree of tears is shining..."

33
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm leaving!

34
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,350
What's wrong? Is that all you can do?

35
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,210
Just who came up with pull-ups?

36
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,090
Woah! Hiromi, you're unbelievable!

37
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,140
You guys are slow! You're already a lap behind me.

38
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,900
Where did all that energy come from?

39
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,090
Well, we have different ways of working out.

40
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,290
You are insane!

41
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm going on ahead!

42
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,680
Shinichirou, you damn pervert!

43
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,560
Stop it, Nobuse!

44
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,090
You look just like an old man

45
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,610
with your eyes focusing right at the girls' white legs.

46
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Hiromi, you alright?

47
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,990
That's your fault. She's tripped over your eyesight, which was focused on her legs.

48
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,380
What the hell is wrong with you?

49
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,700
Yuasa-san sure is nice! {was "sure is having fun"}

50
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,720
She really seems like a top-student, you know.{"That really has the feeling of being a top-student, you know."}

51
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,930
Well even so, she's not all that proud of herself.
Just perfect, isn't she?

52
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,710
Now ain't you an idiot? You're living with her.

53
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,300
If I were you,

54
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,140
I would take advantage of living with her, and peek at her changing.

55
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,170
And have her say "kya! pervert!"

56
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,440
I'll pass that to Ai-chan.

57
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,320
Well then, later.

58
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,060
What's with that? You're so cold...

59
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,500
Wait a minute...{At least wait for me...}

60
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,080
Jeez...

61
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,120
Hey you, over there!{The one down there!}

62
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't look at me without permission.

63
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,800
I- I wasn't really...

64
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,760
Hey, you!

65
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,630
Is there something else you want?!

66
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
I can't get down.

67
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,550
So you were picking food for the chickens?

68
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,320
This food came from the sky.

69
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,140
From the... sky...

70
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,860
This child wants to fly into the sky.

71
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,760
But he's locked in such a place.

72
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,950
I pitied him.

73
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,930
So I got food for him from the highest places.

74
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,150
Huh?

75
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,610
A chicken that wants to fly into the sky?

76
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
Are you not letting that one eat?

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,680
That's because that one doesn't want to fly.

78
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,060
How do you know these things?

79
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,570
I just know.

80
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,790
And you are the one on that side.

81
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,130
Eh? Huh?

82
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,260
You don't want to fly.

83
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,270
Wait a minute! What do you know about someone like me, who has only talked to you once?

84
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,920
You spit, right?

85
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,570
Well, I think I know what's going on.

86
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,300
It seems like you might be able to fly. {"want to fly."}

87
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,540
Yes.

88
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,070
Since your head seems quite empty.{should be "light", but empty sounds better I think}{Seems to me you're just stupid or something.}

89
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,730
May bad fortune befall you!

90
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,710
Oh, that Isurugi Noe from Class A, huh?

91
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,260
Never seen her before.

92
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,150
She transferred in last year.

93
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,980
She's quite cute, but...

94
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,520
There are some scary rumors about her.

95
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,330
Scary...?

96
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,560
For example, it's said that she exchanges e-mails with a person who lives underground

97
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,250
Or that she can summon a pink elephant when she whistles. {wtf @ this line, tiger = tora, he says "zou" (elephant)}

98
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,360
That's nonsense.

99
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,330
No, wait. Since it's her...

100
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,560
Did something happen?

101
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,740
She cursed me.

102
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,950
Well, that's bad.

103
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,750
What?

104
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,960
If Isurugi Noe calls out her Secret special disaster move, you're no match for her! {"Isurugi Noe's Cursing Technique is real divination."} {Hisatsu ougi higeki wo yobu wo machi nai}

105
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,610
After she said "I hope it shrinks" to someone, it turns out it really did! {"Curse that of yours to shrink" to someone...}

106
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,070
Oh, Bo-chan.

107
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,280
Do you need the Chief for something?

108
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,100
Err, well, not really.

109
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,150
After someone dad knew died last year,

110
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,140
Their daughter, Hiromi, was adopted by my family.

111
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,370
We've been in the same class since elementary school.

112
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,410
I was surprised.

113
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,040
Hiromi has always been cheerful...

114
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,750
And because her smiling face interested me.

115
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,100
Because it interested me...

116
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,480
Welcome home.

117
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,460
I'm home.

118
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,610
I'm home.

119
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,510
"May bad fortune befall you"...

120
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,990
Come on,

121
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,260
If you keep sighing, you'll be hit with bad luck.

122
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,040
Even Ai-chan is cursing people...

123
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,010
Huh?

124
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,990
Not like I'm going to do the dance because I want to.

125
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,010
Everyone has high expectations of you!

126
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,910
About what? I'm really bad at the Mugiya dance. How could I be the main star?

127
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,910
TL Note: The Mugiya dance is a traditional dance performed in the Toyama prefecture.

128
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,380
Jeez...

129
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,100
I really don't want to be born in that kind of a family...

130
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,150
I think you're thinking too much about everything.

131
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,210
You're making it seem like you're so much better, even though you're just one year older.

132
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,030
One year is a long time,

133
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,300
A crawling baby could even learn to walk in that time.

134
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,150
Before you say that, remove that beer case under your feet.

135
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,270
I was worried about you, you know!

136
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,160
Aiko!

137
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,550
The store's closed, huh?

138
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,390
Oh, Shinichirou, so you were here!

139
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,820
Miyokichi, you're already done with the chores at home?

140
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,660
Yeah.

141
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,870
You need anything?

142
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,520
Whatever burns my throat, double!

143
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,420
Yeah, yeah... Cola, right?

144
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,450
What's with you, just give it to me.

145
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,720
What's wrong?

146
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,990
I'm heading home.

147
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,400
I feel bad about bothering you two.

148
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,910
Wait a minute! You're not bothering us!

149
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,330
Sorry about that.

150
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,350
Then, see you tomorrow.

151
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,950
Welcome back.

152
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
Shin-chan, give me your jacket.

153
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,310
It's fine.

154
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,530
How did it go?

155
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,700
Nothing special.

156
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,580
I- I'm sor-

157
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm sorry.

158
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,160
Why are you apologizing?

159
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,970
I'm the one that saw you...

160
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,930
I should be the one apologizing!

161
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,280
And yet... why did you...?

162
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,910
Sorry...

163
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,480
"Kya! pervert!"

164
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,230
She didn't react the way Nobuse said...

165
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,960
But that should be the natural reaction, right?

166
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,690
"Kya! pervert!"

167
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,000
My family is taking care of Hiromi.

168
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,160
But...

169
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,300
She has always tried to keep from standing out.

170
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,900
Good morning.

171
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,740
Good morning.

172
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,740
Good morning.

173
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,010
Shin-chan, what is this?

174
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,130
It says that it's a publisher from Tokyo.

175
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,830
Did you open it?!

176
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,190
Answer me first!

177
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,090
How can you hide something like this from your parents?!

178
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,610
Shin-chan, you...

179
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,570
Shin-chan!

180
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,960
Shin-chan...

181
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,700
So you opened it without permission.

182
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,280
Eh? Well, that's because...

183
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,570
It's just that I think it's inappropriate to open it without permission.

184
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,420
But...

185
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,660
Shin-chan is the Nakagami Family's...

186
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,180
Shinichirou is Shinichirou.

187
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,660
It has nothing to do with the Nakagami Family.

188
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,640
"May bad fortune befall you"...

189
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,760
Oi!

190
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,090
My name isn't "Oi".

191
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,960
Isurugi Noe!

192
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,330
I have something for you.

193
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,380
Something nice!

194
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,300
So, please take it back!

195
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,760
"It"?

196
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,920
The bad luck curse!

197
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,900
Come if you dare!

198
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,310
Wonderful! It's wonderful!

199
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,080
It's amazing!

200
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,740
To praise me like that...

201
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,450
You can fly, can't you?

202
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,300
I can fly?

203
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,030
That's right!

204
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,580
You can fly!

205
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,120
Good boy, good boy, good boy!

206
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,690
Let's go show it to Raigou-maru!

207
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,930
Raigou-maru?

208
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,050
It's the name of that chicken.

209
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,540
What about the one that can't fly?

210
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,390
Ground.

211
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,850
So you already named them, huh...

212
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,810
What about your name?

213
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,550
Nakagami Shinichirou.

214
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,480
Nakagami Shinichirou...

215
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,880
A raccoon, maybe?

216
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,350
Ground! What happened?

217
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,960
You saw it, right? Ground!

218
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,220
Hey...

219
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,640
He flew away.

220
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,700
Raigou-maru flew away.

221
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,930
Right? Isn't that right, Ground?

222
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,100
"May bad fortune befall you"

223
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,380
Cursing someone is a double-edged sword.

224
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,480
I am sorry, Raigou-maru...

225
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,900
It's all my fault...

226
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,170
To have made this happen to you...

227
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,620
Sorry...

228
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,450
She's crying...

229
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,330
Isurugi Noe's tears...

230
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,350
Let's go.

231
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:26,010
<i>Shinichirou has a cockroach under his shoe~♪</i>

232
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:32,310
<i>Shinichirou has a cockroach under his shoe~♪</i>

233
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,070
You're strong.

234
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,870
You really liked it, right?

235
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,850
But even so...

236
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,110
I'm sad.

237
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,850
Really, really sad.

238
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,270
Isurugi Noe...

239
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,740
Because... I lost my tears.

240
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,090
I have a mission.

241
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,760
I need to reclaim my tears.

242
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,040
You're seriously trying to replace Raigou-maru with me?

243
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,000
I... What do I want to do?
