00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,547
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

2
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,427
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

3
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:00,896
Lunch is ready!

4
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,629
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

5
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,551
This one will do!

6
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,093
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

7
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:32,267
Welcome back.

8
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,859
Goku-<i>sa</i>, where's Gohan?

9
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:38,606
I'm famished already!

10
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:41,609
What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

11
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,278
Huh? I ain't seen him.

12
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,947
Where could he have gone off to?

13
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:48,316
If you don't eat and
get out of here soon,

14
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,618
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i> and the others
will grow impatient waitin' for you.

15
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,620
All right, I'll go look for him.

16
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,623
I don't think he's gone too far off.

17
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,959
Right. Leave it to me!

18
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,392
I'm countin' on you!

19
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:04,524
Really, what am I goin'
to do with that boy?

20
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,401
Just a little bit more now...

21
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:58,408
W- what was that just now!?
A meteor!? A UFO!?

22
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,857
How's about I go look?

23
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,038
Okay, now...

24
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:39,417
Ah, that's no meteor!
What in tarnation is it?

25
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:48,994
Huh?

26
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:26,608
So, the folks on this planet
are still alive after all, huh?

27
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,910
That miserable Kakarrot!

28
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,470
W- who are you!?

29
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,254
Your battle power is a mere 5, huh?
Piece of trash!

30
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:43,281
D- don't come no closer!
I- I'll kill you!

31
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,174
Hmph. What a fragile people.

32
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:10,813
There's somebody with a great
power around. Range: 4880.

33
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:14,946
Is that you, Kakarrot!?

34
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,914
Father!

35
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,583
Father!

36
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,245
Father!

37
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,147
Hello there, butterfly!

38
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,992
Wait!

39
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,574
You're way over there...

40
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:40,802
All right!

41
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,590
<i>Play dead!</i>

42
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,156
My hat?

43
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:43,796
Father gave that to me!

44
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:22,461
Hey, Gohan!

45
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:37,942
Father! Mother!

46
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,926
What a nice headdress!

47
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:09,440
You sure are pretty.

48
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:15,238
My name is Son Gohan.

49
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,519
Wait!

50
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:31,061
Mother! Father!

51
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:43,202
Hey, you, about that hat...

52
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:52,047
That belongs to my son, Gohan.

53
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,751
Where did you come by it?

54
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,560
Where did you come by it!?

55
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,568
Father! Mother!

56
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:50,474
Gohan!

57
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,275
Gohan!

58
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:05,149
Gohan!

59
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,620
It's Father!

60
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,892
Just wait there!
I'm coming to save you now!

61
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,935
Gohan!

62
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:25,906
A little farther!

63
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,255
Father!

64
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,086
Gohan!

65
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:52,668
Father! Mother!

66
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,481
Father!

67
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:09,048
Gohan!

68
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,390
Gohan!

69
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,804
All right...

70
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:39,909
I'm scared!

71
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm scared! I can't get down!
I'm scared!

72
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:59,270
Father, that was scary!
That was so scary!

73
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:12,242
Gohan, did you-?

74
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,918
I- I don't know.

75
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:23,197
Gohan, let's go home!
Your mommy is worried!

76
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,532
We have to go to Old Timer
Turtle Hermit's place

77
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:27,397
right away too, you know!

78
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:53,526
That lousy Kakarrot!

79
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:11,211
W- what kind of power is this?
It couldn't possibly be...

80
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,940
...Son Goku!?

81
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:27,758
No, it's not!

82
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,572
You're not Kakarrot.

83
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:42,910
Who are you? Do you have
some sort of business with me?

84
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,245
I don't have any business
with the likes of you.

85
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:49,045
Then what have you come here for?
Do you want to die?

86
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,916
You sure are in high spirits.

87
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,530
Ho... Battle power 322. So, there are
folks like you around, huh? However,

88
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,866
you are still no match for me.

89
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:10,269
What did you say!? Do you know
who it is you're talking to here!?

90
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,433
Not really...

91
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:21,207
<i>W</i>- <i>what is the deal</i>
<i>with this guy's power?</i>

92
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:36,192
That was a worthless technique, huh?

93
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:40,530
Is merely kicking up dust all it can do?

94
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:50,737
Now it's my turn. Let me show you
a sample of my techniques.

95
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,886
There's another great power here.

96
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:11,198
That way... Range: 12909.

97
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:15,225
It's large... the largest
power on this planet...

98
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,763
This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

99
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:30,911
T- this is ridiculous!

100
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:35,552
I- I was shaking so much,
I couldn't move!

101
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,480
Have you lost sight of
your pride as a Saiyan,

102
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,243
the mightiest warriors
in the universe...

103
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:15,990
...Kakarrot!?

104
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:22,803
<i>Who are these Saiyans,</i>
<i>the mightiest warriors in the universe?</i>

105
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,271
<i>And who is Kakarrot?</i>

106
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,833
<i>lt appears that the mysterious alien</i>
<i>and Goku are somehow connected.</i>

107
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:35,942
<i>Next time, Goku's past</i>
<i>will finally become clear!</i>

108
