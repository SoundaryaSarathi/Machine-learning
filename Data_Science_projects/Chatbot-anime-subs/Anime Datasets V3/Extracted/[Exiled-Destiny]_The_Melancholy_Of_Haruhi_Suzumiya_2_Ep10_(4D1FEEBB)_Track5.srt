1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:05,139
Next up is the inter-club
relay race.

2
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:08,549
On your mark!
Get set!

3
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,309
Here I go!

4
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,559
Billionaire

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,129
Billionaire
Here.

6
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,699
Indian sum-
Here.

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,599
Indian sum-

8
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,869
Darn it, I wanted to come up from behind
and pass everyone at the end,

9
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,169
but thanks to Yuki, we just
blew them all away.

10
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:38,109
To all times and places

11
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,349
To all times and places
It was a beautiful run.

12
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:43,419
To all times and places
I just hope that the track team doesn't
lose their confidence because of it.

13
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:43,819
In the nick of time

14
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:46,219
In the nick of time
This isn't funny.

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,349
Because of this, people are going to think
we're even weirder than they did before.

16
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,149
Though it might be kind of late
for that to matter.

17
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,429
I suppose that there's no need
to explain that our outfits

18
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,389
Unexplored area
and the four character phrases we have
on our headbands are all Haruhi's idea.

19
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,829
What the heck is this
supposed to mean?

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,029
So, is it okay to get
changed out of this?

21
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,439
And as usual, you guys
are just so weird.

22
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,169
You and Miss Suzumiya's
merry little band.

23
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:20,689
Cut it out. I'm trying to live
my life as quietly as I can.

24
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,019
Well, you did run
in that outfit.

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,019
It was hard
to run in, too.

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,419
That's not the problem.

27
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,899
That's sure to be in the graduation album.
I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,659
Cut me a break.

29
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,429
What? Creepy!

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,569
Did you see her? The one with
the ponytail is cute.

31
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,479
Our seemingly endless summer
vacation finally ended,

32
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,739
and even though the second term
had only just begun,

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,979
we're already in the midst
of our school's field day.

34
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,419
You could tell just by looking at us
that there was no way

35
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,119
that Haruhi was going to sit still
on a day as beautiful as today.

36
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,959
In any case, Haruhi seems
to love festival events.

37
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,249
DAY BY DAY unzari dayone dakara
Day by day, everything's just so dull

38
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:24,019
Doudou to kotowacchau

That's why you need to become
someone that can just reject it all

39
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,789

Oh my boy, you need to be decisive

40
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:34,159

it's natural you'd fall for me

42

Kick away the boring ways
of doing things,

I'm going to decide everything

a huge victory

Of course, it'll feel pleasant,

Everything's a new experience,
what about it?

56
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,289
And so, our crazy
field day ended.

57
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,319
We had just started
a new month,

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,359
and already the school festival
was waiting for us.

59
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:48,559
Right now, our prefectural high school
is preparing for it.

60
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,589
By the way, the class that
Haruhi and I are in,

61
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:53,209
the fifth of the sophomore classes,
had decided to wave our hands

62
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,939
Regarding the school festival
Announce the results of a survey
the fifth of the sophomore classes,
had decided to wave our hands

63
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,839
and go with the half-assed idea of
announcing the results of a survey.

64
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,739
Ever since Ryoko Asakura left
at the beginning of spring,

65
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,649
no one's been crazy enough to try
and take leadership of the class.

66
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,649
We're going, Kyon.

67
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,229
And so today, with a level of disinterest
bordering on apathy,

68
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,199
I once again popped on over
to the clubroom.

69
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,799
Why?

70
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,629
The reason was because the girl
striding boldly beside me

71
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,299
said the following,
and for no other reason.

72
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,899
Announcing the results of a survey?
How dumb can you get?

73
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,179
What's fun about that?
I don't get it at all!

74
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,479
Then you should have
spoken up earlier.

75
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,449
You saw the troubled look
on Mr. Okabe's face,

76
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:42,689
Regarding the school festival

77
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,959
Regarding the school festival
while the class was acting
like we were at a wake.

78
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,019
While the class was acting
like we were at a wake.

79
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,719
Whatever.

80
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:51,799
I wasn't planning on taking part in
whatever the class did anyways.

81
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,559
And yet it would seem that
you had something to do

82
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,999
with our class winning
the field day.

83
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,729
You took part in most of the track-related
competitions and won all of them, right?

84
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,939
Or was that someone else?

85
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,309
This and that are
two different things.

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,139
This is the school festival
we're talking about!

87
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,579
It's the one vitally important
super event that we get in a year.

88
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,119
- Is that so?
- It is!

89
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,049
We're going to do something
really exciting!

90
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,389
As she said that, Haruhi's face
looked like Hannibal's

91
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,729
as he crossed the Alps during
the Second Punic War.

92
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,539
Confident and shining bright.

93
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:30,039
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya I
Confident and shining bright.

94
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,009
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya I

95
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:34,469
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya I
This is the school festival! You need
to be more excited about it!

96
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,879
This is the school festival! You need
to be more excited about it!

97
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,599
A sophomore's school festival only
happens once a year, right?

98
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:47,409
Well, yeah. But it's no reason
to get so riled up about it.

99
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,509
But it is! There's no point
if you don't.

100
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,489
Almost all of the school festivals
I know have been like that.

101
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,059
Did you have a really big school
festival at your junior high?

102
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,829
Not at all. They weren't
exciting at all.

103
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,529
That's why my high school
festivals have to be.

104
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,939
And what would make it
exciting for you?

105
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,339
Please explain it in a way
that I'll understand.

106
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,839
All right, then.

107
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,909
I'll tell you in full detail
when we get to the clubroom.

108
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,779
Hmm, the scent of lavender.

109
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,489
Oh, hello.

110
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,949
Oh, I thought the flowers
were blooming.

111
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,559
- I'll bring some tea right away.
- Oh, don't trouble yourself...

112
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,019
You look like
a dirty old man.

113
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,499
Mikuru, where's Koizumi?

114
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,089
He's not here yet.
He does seem to be a bit late.

115
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,039
Mikuru, how much longer
on the tea?

116
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,179
I'm bringing it now!

117
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,549
Mikuru.

118
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:53,449
Yes?

119
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,489
I think I told you before.
Don't you remember?

120
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,989
Huh? Remember what?

121
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:05,459
When you serve tea, you need to trip
and stumble one third of the time.

122
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,429
You're not acting like
a klutzy maid at all!

123
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,689
Oh... s-sorry!

124
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,769
Does she think a maid needs to be klutzy
so they can be scolded or something?

125
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,429
Well, you're in luck, Mikuru.
You can practice on Kyon.

126
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:21,599
Try to get it so that the cup
lands upside-down on his head!

127
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:26,679
Miss Asahina, only someone like Haruhi
would laugh at a joke like that.

128
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,049
Please figure that out already.

129
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:33,919
Hey dummy, I'm not joking!
I'm always serious!

130
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,959
We're in big trouble
if that's the case.

131
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:40,189
All right, then. I'll show you,
and then you try, Mikuru.

132
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,699
Hey.

133
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,409
Wait.

134
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,579
Hey! Stop interfering!

135
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,049
Interfere? Who in the world
would just stand by

136
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,279
while someone else tried to pour
boiling water on their head?

137
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,629
Here you are.

138
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,929
You should be happy,
Nagato.

139
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,809
Taniguchi would spend
three days drinking that.

140
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,969
I'm sorry, homeroom
ran a bit late.

141
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:36,709
If our meeting had to be delayed
because of that, I apologize.

142
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,049
Meeting? What are you
talking about?

143
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:43,689
I forgot to mention it to you, though
I told everyone else during lunch.

144
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:46,019
I figured I could tell you
any old time.

145
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,929
Why is it that you had the time
to go to their classrooms,

146
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:52,329
but you couldn't be bothered to tell
the guy who sits right in front of you?

147
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,829
It doesn't matter. The problem isn't
when you found out,

148
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:59,839
- it's what we're going to do about it.
- Was that supposed to be profound?

149
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:03,779
More importantly, we need to think
about what we're going to do.

150
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,409
Present tense or future tense.
Choose one.

151
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,549
On top of that, decide if you're going to use
the singular or the plural for the subject!

152
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,849
We're all going to participate, of course.
This is an SOS Brigade event, after all.

153
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,489
By which you mean?

154
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:20,689
I said this earlier. What else is there
besides the school festival?

155
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:23,939
In that case, that's a school-wide event,
not just a Brigade event.

156
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,129
If you're so hot on being featured
in the school festival,

157
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,759
you should have applied to be
a festival staff member.

158
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,309
They probably can use
all the help they can get.

159
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,129
There's no point
to that.

160
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,979
We have to do something suitable
for the SOS Brigade.

161
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,309
We've come this far,
after all!

162
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,719
We're a super prominent group that the
whole school is aware of, you know.

163
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,149
Get it?

164
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:48,329
It's easy for you, since all you're doing
is blathering on about your own plans,

165
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,219
but what about all of the suffering that
Miss Asahina and I have to endure?

166
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,989
Koizumi just sits there,
smiling away,

167
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,199
and Nagato doesn't help
with the brainstorming,

168
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,859
so it'd be nice if she thought about
a normal guy like me once in a while.

169
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:04,069
We have to do something that
lives up to their expectations.

170
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,139
Who in the world has any expectations
for the SOS Brigade?

171
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,339
Now there's a survey
that should be held.

172
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,209
What's your class doing,
Mikuru?

173
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:16,649
Umm, my class? We're opening
a yakisoba cafe...

174
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:19,219
You're going to be
a waitress, I'll bet.

175
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:24,059
How did you know?
Everyone said I should, so...

176
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,499
What about yours,
Koizumi?

177
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,399
Well, we've decided
to hold a play.

178
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,539
But we're still discussing if we'll do
a classical play or something original.

179
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,899
Now there's a class
with some spirit.

180
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,769
It seems like that'd be kind
of annoying, though.

181
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,079
What about you, Yuki?

182
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,979
- Fortune telling.
- Fortune telling?

183
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,349
Yes.

184
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,249
Nagato is going to tell people's fortunes?
Are you sure you don't mean "predicting"?

185
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,729
How about this?

186
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:01,729
Let's combine it all and have a theater cafe
where you take fortune telling surveys.

187
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,839
Stop with the foolishness,
and let's get this meeting started.

188
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,379
There's nothing written yet,
so where should we look?

189
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,209
We're going to
start writing now.

190
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:25,479
Mikuru, you're the secretary, so
be sure to write everything down.

191
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,489
Okay!

192
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,859
I don't know when Miss Asahina
became our secretary.

193
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,359
No one does, because Haruhi
probably decided that just now.

194
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:47,069
We, the SOS Brigade, are going
to hold a movie showing!

195
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:57,389
I don't know what goes on
inside of Haruhi's head.

196
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:01,289
Never mind that.
This is normal for her. But...

197
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:05,929
How is this a meeting? This is more
like you giving a policy speech.

198
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,029
This is normal
for us.

199
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,159
Whoa, close!

200
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,139
It looks like Miss Suzumiya had decided
what we were going to do from the start.

201
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,469
It doesn't look like there's
any room for negotiation.

202
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,969
Still, I wonder
why a movie.

203
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:21,169
She probably saw some
C-movie late last night

204
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:24,869
and it left her in a dreary mood
or something.

205
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:29,739
There's something I've
always wondered about.

206
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,959
I wonder about the inside
of your head.

207
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,749
On TV dramas, someone usually
dies in the last episode.

208
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,729
Doesn't that seem
really unnatural?

209
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,959
Why do they die with such
good timing? It's weird.

210
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:45,869
That's why I hate shows where
someone dies at the end.

211
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:48,599
I would never shoot a movie
like that!

212
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,879
SOS Brigade: Movie showing

213
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,209
That's what I mean.
Understand?

214
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,079
What do you mean,
"That's what I mean"?

215
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:03,879
All we know is that we're showing a movie.
How are we going to pay for it?

216
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:06,749
Kyon, you need
some more smarts.

217
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:12,059
We're going to MAKE the movie and then
show it at the school festival.

218
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,229
And the credits will read
"Presented by the SOS Brigade"!

219
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,799
When did we become
the Movie Club?

220
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:21,329
What are you talking about?
We'll always be the SOS Brigade.

221
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,309
We haven't turned into
the Movie Club.

222
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,869
Okay, I understand.

223
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,809
We're going to shoot a movie
of our own creation,

224
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,609
and then show it to the school.
Is that right?

225
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,439
That's it!

226
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,049
But... why a movie?

227
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,519
Last night, I had some
trouble sleeping.

228
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,959
When I turned the TV on,
there was a weird movie on.

229
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,089
I thought so.

230
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:48,359
And it was such a
pathetic movie.

231
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:52,269
It was so bad that I thought about
internationally crank-calling the director.

232
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,959
Then I thought, "I can make
a better movie than this!"

233
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,349
And so I figured
we should go for it.

234
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:08,039
If you want to be a director
or a producer, that's fine.

235
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,109
Then we can do whatever
we want, right?

236
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,419
What are you
talking about?

237
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,859
What would you do if we said that
we didn't want to do that?

238
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,989
You can't make a movie
with just a director.

239
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,999
Don't worry, I've already
got a script mostly done.

240
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,929
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

241
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,739
There's nothing to worry about.
Just follow my lead, same as always.

242
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,839
- There's absolutely no need to worry.
- I'm worried.

243
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,779
Leave the planning to me.
I'll take care of all of it.

244
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:35,899
Now I'm really worried.

245
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,569
Man, you're so annoying. I said
we're doing it, so we're doing it.

246
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:43,019
We're aiming to be voted the best event
of the school festival.

247
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,059
If we do, then even the stupid
student council will finally

248
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,089
recognize the SOS Brigade
as a club.

249
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,389
No! We're going to MAKE
them recognize us.

250
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,459
First we need to get the public
on our side!

251
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,119
How are we going
to pay for this?

252
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,129
- We have funds.
- Where?

253
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,359
We have the money that they
gave the Literature Club.

254
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,499
Then that's the Literature Club's funds.
It's not for you to use.

255
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,699
But Yuki said it's okay.

256
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:15,409
I did.

257
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,149
Okay, everyone!

258
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,589
This is more important than
whatever your classes are doing!

259
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,559
I'll listen to any opposing opinions
after the school festival.

260
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,999
Got it? The director's orders
are absolute!

261
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,189
First brigade leader,
and now director?

262
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,669
What's she planning to become in the end?
Please don't say "god" or something.

263
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:36,669
Okay, we're done
for today!

264
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,969
I've got a lot to think about,
since I'm the producer!

265
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:44,039
I'll tell you
the details tomorrow.

266
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,219
Well, this is good.

267
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:54,549
I'm relieved that it's not something like
capturing an alien to put it in a sideshow,

268
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:59,559
or shooting down a UFO and then making
an exhibit of its internal structures.

269
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,069
Besides, I'm interested in seeing what kind
of movie Miss Suzumiya wants to make.

270
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,829
It looks like this will be quite
an interesting school festival.

271
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,999
Quite interesting indeed.

272
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,839
D-Do you need something?

273
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,279
Oh, nothing.

274
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:21,979
I was just wondering what costume
Haruhi is going to bring next.

275
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,789
Still... a movie...

276
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,289
A movie, huh?

277
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,729
To be honest, I was kind
of interested in it, too.

278
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,869
Though not as much
as Koizumi.

279
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,769
It might be better if I was looking
forward to it more, though.

280
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,149
After all, there probably isn't
going to be anyone that will be.

281
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,909
I take back what I said.

282
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,249
I shouldn't have looked
forward to it at all.

283
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,589
After school the next day, I ended up
with a frown on my face.

284
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,599
General Commander, General Director,
Producer, Writer: Haruhi Suzumiya

285
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,999
Lead actress: Mikuru Asahina
Lead actor: Itsuki Koizumi
Supporting actress: Yuki Nagato

286
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:11,329
Assistant Director, Photography, Editor,
Gofer, Assistant, Errand boy,
Quartermaster, Everything else: Kyon

287
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,039
So what am I
supposed to do?

288
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,969
Just as it's written
on there.

289
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,509
I'm the heroine?

290
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,379
Umm, if it's possible, I'd like
to have a less prominent role...

291
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,849
No way! We're going to have you
play a really flashy role.

292
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:30,919
You're kind of like our
Brigade's trademark, after all.

293
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,459
You might want to practice
your autograph.

294
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,189
When we have our premier showing,
I'm sure that people will want it.

295
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,689
Where are you planning
on holding that?

296
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,389
But I can't act.

297
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:46,339
It's all right. I'll be sure to
give you perfect direction.

298
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,469
Oh, but Yuki and Koizumi don't seem
to be very serious about this.

299
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,129
I told them
this took priority.

300
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,969
I guess I'll have to give them a mild warning
for showing up late because of their classes.

301
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:00,449
I think it's stranger that Miss Asahina
and I are here, right now.

302
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:05,219
Is it okay for you to not participate
in your class's meeting, Miss Asahina?

303
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:11,159
Yes. I'm just going to be a waitress,
so I just need to get sized for my outfit.

304
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,159
I wonder what the outfit
is going to be like.

305
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,529
I'm kind of looking
forward to it.

306
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,569
The slightly embarrassed smile
on Miss Asahina's face

307
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:19,169
seems to point to her being
used to cosplay now.

308
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,209
It's probably better that she'll be wearing
the proper outfit for the proper place

309
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:26,209
instead of wearing these pointless
costumes for the SOS Brigade.

310
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:30,169
Oh, if you want to be a waitress
that badly, Mikuru,

311
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,839
I'll bring some costumes
for you.

312
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,449
Well, never mind that.

313
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,419
By the way Kyon, what do you think
is necessary to make a movie?

314
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,289
I guess it would be an original idea
and an untiring passion to create.

315
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,299
A camera, of course. How can we
shoot a movie without equipment?

316
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,369
I don't need an abstract
answer like that.

317
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:01,169
That might be true, but I didn't want to give
such a matter-of-fact answer... oh well.

318
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,579
And that's why we're going
to go get a video camera.

319
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,639
Oh, M-M-Miss Suzumiya,
now that you mention it,

320
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,549
there's something I need to do,
so I need to go back to my class-

321
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:14,989
Quiet.

322
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,359
Don't worry.

323
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:21,759
You've never once said, "Don't worry"
when we didn't actually have to worry.

324
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,689
We're not going to use your body to
pay for what we need this time.

325
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,139
I just need your help,
is all.

326
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,209
Tell us how she's
supposed to help!

327
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,209
If you don't, then Miss Asahina and I
are not budging from these seats.

328
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,379
We're going to look
for sponsors.

329
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:40,419
It would give them a better idea of what
we're doing if we brought the star, right?

330
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,179
You're coming, too,
to carry the stuff.

331
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:53,219
It's supposed to be autumn,
but it's not very cool at all.

332
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,429
It looks like the Earth
has finally gone stupid,

333
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:59,789
and it forgot to have autumn
come to Japan.

334
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:10,949
After we came down the mountain, we got
on a local train for a private train line,

335
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,849
and took it
three stops.

336
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:16,849
We went to a place not too far
from the area with the cherry trees

337
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:19,319
that Miss Asahina and I
walked along not too long ago.

338
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:26,989
Iwaigawa Shopping Strip

339
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,999
- Here we are.
- I see.

340
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,739
Ohmori Electronics

341
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:31,639
Ohmori Electronics
It looks like she's planning on getting
our filming equipment from here.

342
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,569
It looks like she's planning on getting
our filming equipment from here.

343
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,329
But how?

344
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,339
Wait here a second.
I'll go talk to him.

345
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,639
Hold this!

346
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:52,249
I'll probably grab
Miss Asahina and bolt

347
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:55,749
if Haruhi does anything that's even
the slightest bit suspicious.

348
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,559
Maybe I should warn
the nice man...

349
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:07,029
...that he shouldn't nod
at everything Haruhi says.

350
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,339
I wonder what
she's doing.

351
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:12,169
She's probably asking him
to lend her

352
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,769
the highest-end digital handycam
he has in the store for free.

353
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,679
She's capable of saying
something like that, after all.

354
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,419
What a troublemaker.

355
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:26,619
Haruhi believes that her own standards
and decisions are absolute.

356
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,789
And she sometimes incorrectly assumes
that other people share her opinions.

357
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,559
In fact, that's often
the case.

358
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,959
Which means she just
doesn't get it.

359
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,219
If you want to make
faster-than-light travel possible,

360
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,299
just put Haruhi
on your spaceship.

361
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,269
She would probably just ignore
the laws of relativity for you.

362
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,069
Oh, it looks like
they've finished.

363
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,169
Ta-dah!

364
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,409
And with this, we've taken our first step.
We're right on schedule.

365
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,979
How did you manage to get such an
expensive-looking camera for free?

366
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:58,319
Do you have some kind of blackmail
material on that old man?

367
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:02,319
No way. I just explained the situation,
and he generously donated it.

368
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:06,129
If he gave it to you, then tell me
what you said. I want one, too.

369
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,659
It wasn't much. I said we wanted to shoot
a film, and so he gave it to me.

370
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,389
No problem.

371
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,099
There may not be a problem now, but I
have the feeling there'll be one later.

372
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:17,169
Stop worrying
so much.

373
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,009
All you have to do is be my
underling and do as I say.

374
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,179
All right, let's go to
the next store.

375
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:35,959
I started to understand.
When she pointed at us,

376
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,659
Haruhi's index finger was aimed
squarely at Miss Asahina.

377
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,319
The cost of these items is going
to determine what Miss Asahina

378
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,869
is going to have
to do.

379
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,669
I wonder if I should
tell her.

380
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,099
Ta-dah!

381
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,369
What do you have
this time?

382
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,599
Weapons.

383
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,899
Here you go.

384
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,409
What am I supposed
to do with this?

385
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,519
We're going to use them for our
gunfight action scenes

386
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:01,309
Flashy gunfights are the
basis for entertainment.

387
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,909
If we can, I'd love to blow up
an entire building.

388
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,519
Do you know where we can
get some dynamite?

389
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,849
- Think they sell it at the general store?
- How should I know?

390
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,589
I'm pretty sure that they don't sell it
on the internet, though.

391
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:13,919
So what am I supposed to do
with this stuff?

392
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:17,499
Take it back to your place for now,
and bring it to the clubroom tomorrow.

393
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,039
It would be too bothersome
to go back to school right now.

394
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,539
- I'm supposed to?
- Yes, you.

395
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,229
It's her special
SOS Brigade smile,

396
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,239
the one you don't see in
the classroom very often.

397
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,209
Whenever Haruhi
smiles like this,

398
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:31,179
it means that my role in salvaging the
impending disaster has come back.

399
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,609
It feels like a reverse
"Straw Millionaire."

400
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,379
Umm...

401
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,499
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

402
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:49,199
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

403
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:53,759
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

404
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:57,039
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

405
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,679
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

406
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,879
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

407
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,419
Tomare!
Stop!

408
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:09,189
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

409
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:13,929
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

410
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:15,089
Nazenara
That's because

411
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:20,299
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

412
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,069
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

413
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,499
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

414
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:30,379
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

415
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:34,279
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

416
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,979
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

417
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:39,069
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
