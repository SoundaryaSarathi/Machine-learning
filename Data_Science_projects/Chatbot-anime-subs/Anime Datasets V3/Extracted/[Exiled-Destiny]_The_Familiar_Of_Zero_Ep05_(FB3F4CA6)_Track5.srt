1
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,800
The treasure that was
stored in your house

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,496
has definitely been transferred
into my hands.

3
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,600
Fouquet the Sculptor.

4
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:48,782
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

5
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:57,451
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

6
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,827
The sky where two moons
never fade away

7
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,906
That's an impossibility, right?

8
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:20,647
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,916
Even if you trip and
become depressed

11
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:40,523
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

12
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:47,207
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

13
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:53,547
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

14
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:59,520
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,985
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

16
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:16,427
Tristein's Princess

17
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,573
Straighten your back more!

18
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,200
Like this?

19
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,502
Your right arm and right leg
are moving together!

20
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,810
You know, I suck at this stuff
when I have to think about it.

21
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,753
"When I am conscious of something,"

22
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,017
"I cannot perform
as well as I wish to!"

23
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,921
It's all terrible... Mannerisms,
pattern of speech...

24
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,631
What's with this all of a sudden,
complaining about this and that!

25
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,233
I was so careless...

26
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,536
I had completely forgotten
about the exhibition.

27
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,671
Exhibition?

28
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,174
There is a gathering that
happens every year.

29
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:59,179
All students exhibit their summoned
familiars to the whole Institute.

30
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,049
How stupid. Why don't
you just skip out?

31
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,952
All second-year students
are required to attend!

32
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,689
In any case... I just want to
avoid being embarrassed.

33
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,657
Since you can speak,

34
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,695
I thought you could make
a witty speech or something.

35
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,798
I know! I have something new
that I've gotten really good at!

36
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,166
Really?

37
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,225
Washing panties!

38
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,632
So, how about I demonstrate
washing your panties?

39
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,945
Goodness, my master
may have a face like that,

40
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,715
but she wears lacy panties like this!

41
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,515
She's so fashionable, even
where people can't see!

42
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,316
Is that all you want to say?

43
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,891
It wasn't true! I'm just joking!

44
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:56,170
That's right! Saito, you can
wield a sword, right?

45
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,006
Why don't you show some
of your swordsmanship?

46
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,674
That's no good.

47
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,269
I thought that when I decided
to barge into Mott's place.

48
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,589
You couldn't even swing once?

49
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,591
That time when I was
fighting Guiche...

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,660
I think it was all some sort of mistake.

51
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,862
Well, what happened
in Count Mott's manor

52
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,598
turned out to be for
the best in the end.

53
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
But come to think of it, it's strange.

54
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,001
What is?

55
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,170
Because my familiar did
something like that,

56
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,106
it wouldn't be strange for me to
receive some kind of scolding.

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,310
But nothing ever since...

58
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,645
Anyway, we don't have any time.

59
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,945
Think up something that you
can do before class is over.

60
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,649
Here goes...

61
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,695
Hey, what's that?
Such a strange dance...

62
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,686
How embarrassing.

63
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,734
I'm suddenly asked what
tricks I can show...

64
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,804
Well, you just do your best, partner.

65
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,740
Hey, Derf, since you're a sword,

66
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,711
don't you know at least one trick
to knock everyone's socks off?

67
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,912
Don't be stupid!

68
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,448
Unfortunately, I'm more
of a practical model.

69
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,973
Oh, what should I do?

70
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,346
Mr. Saito?

71
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,922
What are you doing?

72
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,184
Siesta...

73
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,063
Well, y'know...

74
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,300
Perhaps you're practicing
for the exhibition?

75
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,770
Yeah, that's it! But how
did you figure it out?

76
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,308
All the second-year students
are training very hard.

77
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,945
This year, Lady Henrietta
will be coming as well.

78
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,277
Lady Henrietta?

79
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,917
About preparations for
tomorrow's exhibition...

80
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,086
From cleaning all areas
of the Institute,

81
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,757
set-up of the guest seats,
preparations for the banquet...

82
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,992
Under Mr. Colbert's guidance,

83
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,995
everything is moving along
without interruption.

84
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,896
Concerning other
potential problems...

85
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:13,106
Oh, that was rather close, Motsognir.

86
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,233
So, today's color was?

87
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,011
What?! You couldn't get a look?

88
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,309
That's unfortunate.

89
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,481
Be kinder to your elders...

90
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,446
Keep it up, Flame!

91
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,052
Right there, a spin, a dance of flames!

92
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,793
You're the best, Flame!

93
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,304
Right, good job, Kubacil.

94
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,777
Maybe the ribbon isn't working...

95
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,751
Verdande...

96
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,018
I'm sure the princess will be sure
to understand your elegant grace.

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,784
I see...

98
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,765
So the princess will be coming
to watch all this.

99
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,235
Lady Henrietta is a symbolic
existence to all the citizenry,

100
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,295
ever since the King passed away.

101
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,803
So she's popular.

102
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,542
The gift from the Palace will be mine!

103
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,510
A couple people out there
have a different objective.

104
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,090
We're terribly busy getting
ready to welcome her too.

105
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,291
See you later.

106
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,225
Yeah, later.

107
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,059
Please do your best as well, Mr. Saito.

108
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,800
Sure.

109
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,837
Make sure to guard the gates
on the actual day.

110
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,449
Yes, sir!

111
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,384
Mr. Colbert...

112
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:08,188
You are taking the guard from
the vault to guard the gates?

113
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,558
After all, everything is so sudden
that we're shorthanded.

114
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:16,530
But didn't I hear that Fouquet the
Sculptor was after the treasure here?

115
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,301
Even so, what thief would
choose the precise time

116
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,070
that the Royal Princess' guards
were on the premises?

117
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,840
In the first place, not even
Triangle-class mages

118
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,832
would stand a chance
against this door.

119
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:36,650
Even this Institute's guards
have to show off to the Palace.

120
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,208
That's very true.

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,622
Princess of the Kingdom of Tristein,

122
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,888
Her Highness,
Lady Henrietta has arrived!

123
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,305
What beauty...

124
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,985
That's the princess of Tristein?

125
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,321
I'm more beautiful than she is!

126
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,089
Don't you think so?

127
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,351
Well...

128
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,396
Hey, she's cute.

129
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,200
You stay quiet! You're only
a familiar, you're being rude!

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,394
Yeah, yeah...

131
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:36,009
Mr. Osman, I apologize for
this sudden, selfish request.

132
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,078
Not at all!

133
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,915
The students and I have all been
eagerly awaiting your arrival.

134
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,552
This one year, I really wanted
to see it with my own eyes.

135
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,587
Oh, is that...

136
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,646
A personal matter.

137
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,688
Hold on...

138
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,400
What part of that is your
vaunted swordsmanship?

139
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,402
Are you taking this seriously?

140
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,573
It's impossible to attempt to
do something in just one day.

141
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,141
After all...

142
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,409
What?

143
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,934
I'm more used to panty-washing...

144
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,985
Hold it! Hold on! I'll be serious!

145
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,215
I'll do it, yeah yeah yeah!

146
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,624
A guest, a guest...

147
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,294
Sheesh... Who is it so late at night?

148
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,989
Right, coming right up...

149
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,634
Who are you?!

150
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,329
It's been a while...

151
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,598
Louise Françoise!

152
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,269
Your Highness, the Princess!

153
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,055
Louise! Louise, it went that way!

154
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,420
Wait!

155
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,574
If anything happens that
makes you want to cry,

156
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,099
please make sure to tell me.

157
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,046
I will make sure to embrace you.

158
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:27,349
Then, I will make sure to help you
out when you're in a bind, Louise!

159
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,388
Louise, Louise... Good old Louise...

160
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,497
You should not, Princess!

161
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,033
To come to such a humble
abode by yourself!

162
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,604
Stop those formalities,
Louise Françoise.

163
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,374
We are friends, are we not?

164
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,710
Princess, those words
are too much for me...

165
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,508
Um, how do you guys
know each other?

166
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,316
When the Princess was
but a young girl,

167
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,319
I was honored to be her playmate.

168
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,651
Please say "childhood friends."

169
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,756
Oh, I've wanted to
see you all this time.

170
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,526
Princess...

171
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,161
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,196
Ever since Father passed away,

173
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,791
I haven't had anyone that
I could open my heart to.

174
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:18,327
Princess, I was surprised when
I received a letter from you.

175
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,475
Oh, I see. Because the
Princess was coming,

176
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,443
you quickly wanted me to show off...

177
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,446
You stay quiet!

178
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,183
Why are you standing there like an
idiot, right before the Princess?!

179
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,616
It is well.

180
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,348
Please be at ease, Mr. Familiar.

181
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,451
She's too cute...

182
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,795
What are you staring at?!

183
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,265
Please forgive him.
He really knows no manners.

184
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,530
So much that he stands up
against Count Mott.

185
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,173
I have been wanting
to see you as well.

186
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,109
I wondered what kind of person

187
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,678
the familiar that stood up
to a nobleman was.

188
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,168
Princess?!

189
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
Rest assured, Louise.

190
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,186
It caused a bit of a stir
within the Palace,

191
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,721
but there will be no punishment.

192
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,789
Then, Princess, you...

193
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,225
Did you forget?
I promised you long ago

194
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:16,719
that I would help you out
when you were in a bind.

195
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,456
I am a princess for now, you know.

196
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,134
Princess...

197
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,365
There is no way that I can thank you!

198
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,543
Louise, you summoned
a splendid familiar.

199
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,745
On the contrary!

200
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:35,681
Such a vulgar, strange creature
is the biggest mistake of my life!

201
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,817
Ouch... That hurts...

202
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,319
I'm telling you it hurts!

203
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,651
I'm telling you, stay put!

204
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,156
This was the most fun I have had
in the past few years.

205
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,356
Thank you, Louise Françoise.

206
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,193
The same goes for me, Princess.

207
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,130
Mr. Familiar...

208
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:02,742
Me?

209
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,210
Please do your best tomorrow.

210
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,906
Well, you can look forward to it.

211
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,285
Damn you!

212
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,853
Such behavior to the princess!

213
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,821
Why do you always...

214
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,418
Damn it, don't dodge them!

215
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,298
Stay quiet! Damn you,
why are you such an idiot?!

216
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,200
Freedom is the best treasure, after all.

217
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,330
Good night.

218
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,306
Princess?

219
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,771
We will now begin the presentation
of this year's familiars.

220
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,197
That was Tabitha the Snowy Wind.

221
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,337
Understand?

222
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,372
One bow, and you come back.

223
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,474
Don't you dare try to do
anything unnecessary!

224
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,244
After all that you've made me
practice, is that it?!

225
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,245
It's all right now.

226
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,480
The Princess already saw
what you were really like!

227
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,814
Next up... Miss Louise de La Vallière!

228
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,854
Here goes.

229
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,253
Okay...

230
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,525
Let me introduce you.

231
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,551
This is my familiar, Hiraga Saito.

232
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,563
His type is a...

233
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,827
Go for it, Louise the Zero!

234
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,967
His type is a...

235
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,265
...peasant!

236
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,280
He's a peasant-type?!

237
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,314
That's his social rank!

238
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,083
Just what we expect
from Louise the Zero!

239
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,784
She sure meets expectations!

240
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,252
Shut up! Stay quiet and watch!

241
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,022
Let's go, Derf!

242
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,857
Saito?

243
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,485
Go? Where are we going?

244
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,533
Hey, don't you realize
the situation we're in?

245
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,468
Like I know!

246
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,595
You're the one who drew me
all of a sudden!

247
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,775
What's up with that?
He's arguing with his own sword!

248
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:21,475
Oh, darling, everything you do
is strange and wonderful.

249
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,010
All of you, watch closely!

250
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,550
I'll show you some elegant
swordsmanship now...

251
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,324
Let go!

252
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,092
This is the worst.

253
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,084
Let go! That hurts, you're too strong!

254
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,341
To think that this fixture
magic was so sturdy...

255
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,603
If that's the case...

256
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,646
Then we will now begin the judging.

257
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,477
I have no time left.

258
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,973
I thought a physical shock
would do the trick.

259
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,675
I told you, nothing more than a bow!

260
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,410
But they were all cracking up.

261
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,004
You just made a fool of yourse...

262
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,517
Golem?!

263
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,952
What is this?

264
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,388
Is this also someone's familiar?

265
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,855
No, this is...

266
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,982
You're out of luck!

267
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,388
Look out!

268
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:48,896
Now, I would like to announce
this year's grand prize winner...

269
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,905
Saito!

270
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,440
Louise! Run!

271
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,408
Let go of Saito!

272
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,780
What are you doing?! I'm telling you
to run away from here!

273
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,441
In Ex...

274
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,450
You're wasting your time!

275
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,652
Louise! Hurry up and run!
Bet... Flame...

276
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,415
Fireball!

277
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,229
Hey, did you just hear something?

278
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,599
To think that my Verdande
was not chosen...

279
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,468
It was Tabitha's Sylpheed after all.

280
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,493
Well, that was an adequate choice.

281
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,507
It was an amazing familiar.

282
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:31,443
If you don't mind, may we
see it fly one more time?

283
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,512
Are you trying to kill me?!

284
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,585
Shut up! It was only a small mistake!

285
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,213
What part of that was a fireball?

286
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,761
The wall?

287
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,229
That magic just now?

288
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,799
Let go of Saito!

289
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,135
Listen to me! I'm serious this time!

290
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,004
Stop it! I'm telling you to run!

291
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,006
In any case, this is
a lucky break for me.

292
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,871
Go, Golem!

293
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,616
What is it?!

294
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,516
Protect the Royal Highness!

295
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,679
Golem!

296
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,151
I thank you for this!

297
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:35,700
Saito...

298
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,590
The Staff of Destruction has been
transferred into my hands.

299
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,956
Fouquet the Sculptor.

300
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,118
She got us.

301
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,664
No signs of the thief have been found.

302
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,599
All we found was an earthen clod.

303
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,504
What a catastrophe!

304
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,539
To think that the vault
would be broken into...

305
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,351
That's a surprise. That it was
that Fouquet the Sculptor...

306
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,686
Hey, Tabitha, did you see her face?

307
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,555
She hid her face.

308
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,750
Is that so? How boring.

309
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,793
To control such a large golem,

310
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,665
there's no doubt that she was
a Triangle-class mage.

311
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:36,569
Well, in any case, since both
of us survived, it's all right.

312
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,662
That's not how things go!

313
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,911
I am so glad both of you were safe!

314
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,245
Princess!

315
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,580
I am terribly sorry!

316
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,673
The Palace's treasure...

317
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,920
It was not your responsibility,
Louise Françoise.

318
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,021
Even so...

319
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,852
Princess, please hurry.

320
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,287
I must report this incident
to the Palace.

321
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,298
I will see you in the near future,

322
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,664
Louise, Mr. Familiar.

323
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,771
I just hope the princess doesn't
have to take responsibility for this.

324
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,635
Responsibility? Just because
a thief came when she was visiting?

325
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,884
I've been hearing bad rumors
about the Palace recently.

326
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,910
Not that worrying about any
of it does me any good...

327
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,024
Hey, Louise... Can I
ask you something?

328
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,259
What?

329
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,059
When I got caught, why
didn't you escape to safety?

330
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,026
You're an idiot.

331
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:45,226
A mage who forsakes her familiar
is not a real mage.

332
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:11,761
As if I were under a real magic spell

333
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:22,631
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

334
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:34,320
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

335
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:45,424
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

336
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:57,371
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

337
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:08,243
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

338
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:14,483
For the day to start from zero

339
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,507
Saito! Why are you so spaced out?!

340
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,737
Come on, we're heading out!

341
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,704
We're going to go capture
that thief Fouquet, of course!
