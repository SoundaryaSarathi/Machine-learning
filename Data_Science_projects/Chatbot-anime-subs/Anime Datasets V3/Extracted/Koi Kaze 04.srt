1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,700
Evening Shower

17
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,230
Hey.

18
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,030
Are you all right?

19
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,130
What?

20
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,230
Your face.

21
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,630
It's terrible!

22
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,530
Did you get a good rest on your day off?

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,130
Yeah.

24
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,130
You look so out of it to me.

25
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,130
That's not true.

26
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,430
You have to fix yourself up for the events at least.

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,230
I know.

28
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,230
Are you still brooding over it?

29
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,930
Your break-up?

30
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,130
No way.

31
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,530
Well, it's fine then.

32
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,030
In truth

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,730
I don't have any regrets or attachments about getting dumped.

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,730
Koshiro, have you ever felt a yearning for someone from the bottom of your heart?

35
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,730
No.

36
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm terrible at getting the gist of things.

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,330
You don't look that way.

38
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,330
And then I fell down.

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,830
Odagiri!

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,830
Yes.

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,030
But usually I'm pretty calm.

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,430
What should we do about today's after-party?

43
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,230
The chief said it's on him.

44
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,030
Really? Yes!

45
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,730
Of course I'm in!

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,030
I made a promise today so I'll be leaving first.

47
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,730
Promise?

48
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,730
A movie. I'm watching a movie.

49
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,730
Is it with Nanoka-san?

50
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,530
What's your point?

51
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,630
I can't help it. She forced me to promise her.

52
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,430
I'd love to go with you!

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,330
Shut up! You just go and drink with the chief!

54
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,930
Koshiro,

55
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,530
Before when we had a meeting here didn't you flirt with a high school girl?

56
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,430
Was that...?

57
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,530
Flirt?!

58
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,730
With a high school girl?

59
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,330
Idiot! NO!

60
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,530
That was...

61
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,830
That was Nanoka-chan wasn't it?

62
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,730
Why didn't you just say she was your sister in the first place?

63
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,930
Odagiri. Help me carry this.

64
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,130
Yes.

65
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,230
What do you mean flirting with Nanoka san?

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,830
No idea.

67
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,830
I don't really get it either.

68
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,830
Why?

69
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,030
Don't look at me like it's so unusual.

70
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,630
But, why?

71
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,130
You had a beard this morning!

72
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,630
We have to look clean for our events or else we would get scolded.

73
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,430
Look clean?

74
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,430
Is it weird?

75
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,130
You look cool!

76
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,830
But it looks painful!

77
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,030
What are you saying...?

78
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,330
This movie is...

79
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Don't get so close!

80
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,830
Thank you very much.

81
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,930
You're welcome.

82
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,030
What are you pondering about?

83
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,830
Nothing.

84
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,430
Take out your student ID.

85
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,530
Oh yeah.

86
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,430
What's wrong?

87
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm going to go buy the tickets.

88
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,930
What is he thinking, making you come home all alone at this hour?

89
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,930
He said it doesn't matter; just go home first.

90
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,630
That guy is hopeless.

91
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,430
He went off somewhere on his way home right after the movie ended.

92
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,530
Where did that bum go?

93
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,930
I don't know. He didn't say anything.

94
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,130
Hey.

95
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,630
Your uniform's going to get wrinkled.

96
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,130
I don't care.

97
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,930
So?

98
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,130
About earlier.

99
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,130
That was my younger sister.

100
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,430
I don't think I ever told you, but

101
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,130
she's my younger sister whom I've been living apart from until now.

102
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,830
You know my parents are divorced right?

103
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,930
And she's been with my mom the whole time.

104
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,430
We've been living together since this spring because her high school is nearby.

105
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,030
That's it?

106
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,330
Is that really all?

107
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,930
Yeah.

108
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,430
What?

109
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,830
You said you had something to tell me so I was wondering what it was.

110
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,530
It's not a laughing matter!

111
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,930
I didn't want you to think I started going after high school girls after I got dumped.

112
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,930
I was worried for nothing.

113
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,930
It's so like you to worry about stupid appearances and dating high school girls though.

114
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,330
Well, I'm sorry.

115
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,330
I'll never come again.

116
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,830
Dinner..

117
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,530
Have you eaten yet?

118
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,830
Suddenly, a stupid thought passed through my mind.

119
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,030
Which reminds me, it's been 3 months since I last had sex.

120
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
But who cares because you can drink.

121
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
That's not true.

122
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,380
It is! You're way stronger than me!

123
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,780
Isn't it good?

124
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,080
It's my favorite restaurant.

125
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,180
Yeah.

126
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,880
I come here a lot by myself

127
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
What are you saying, stupid?

128
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm not stupid. I'm serious.

129
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I don't believe you!

130
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,980
I don't joke around about things like that.

131
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,580
How about Sachiko-chan?

132
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,780
She's just a friend..

133
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,980
No way!

134
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Really...

135
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,780
You...

136
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
How's work been lately?

137
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
Why?

138
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,680
You used to always tell me that you wanted to quit.

139
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,880
You still remember?

140
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,680
Who would forget after listening to you complain so much?

141
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,080
I thought you weren't listening with your half-hearted replies.

142
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,880
That's not true.

143
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,780
And how is your job?

144
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Normal I guess

145
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
I see.

146
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
And you?

147
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,780
Did you have an event today?

148
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,880
Yeah

149
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,080
Or did you shave your beard because your high school girlfriend told you to?

150
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm saying she's...

151
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,280
What is it?

152
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
Nothing.

153
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,380
What?

154
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,380
I was wondering if any taxis would come this way.

155
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,380
If you go a little further you'll come to the main street. It'll be easier to find one there.

156
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm moving next month.

157
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm quitting my job too

158
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
Although thats a little later on.

159
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,180
I see

160
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,580
By the way, my boyfriend is coming now.

161
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah.

162
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,380
What?

163
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,280
He's a very good person.

164
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,180
I see.

165
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,280
Best of luck to you, Koshiro.

166
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,880
Really.

167
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,180
Good night.

168
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,080
What should we do afterwards?

169
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm glad I didn't say anything stupid like that.

170
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,580
I'm really glad.

171
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,880
Don't stay up too late!

172
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,380
Yes.

173
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,980
I wasn't going out with her just for the sex.

174
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,280
Have you ever felt a yearning for someone from the bottom of your heart, Koshiro?

175
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,680
But I don't think it's bad.

176
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,780
Is it that big of a deal to fall in love with someone?

177
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,880
Is yearning something you can brag about?

178
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,880
What does it mean to "yearn" anyway?

179
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,980
That idiot!

180
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,780
Brother?

181
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,180
Sorry!

182
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,380
Good morning.

183
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,180
I'm sorry about last night,

184
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,780
for suddenly barging in on you.

185
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
I'll be careful next time.

186
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,480
The movie,

187
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
let's go see another one.

188
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,080
But you have to go home with me this time.

189
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,280
What?

190
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
Nothing.

191
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,350
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

192
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,380
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

193
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,280
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

194
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,750
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

195
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,840
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

196
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,240
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

197
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,820
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

198
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,070
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

199
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,510
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

200
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,310
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

201
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,720
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

202
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,090
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

203
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,590
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

204
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,710
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

205
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,500
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

206
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,170
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

207
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,320
Ya... umm... well....

208
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm sorry I sniffed it.. I'm sorry I sniffed it.

209
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm sorry I sniffed it!

210
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,380
Innocent! Like hell!

211
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,730
I have no dignity.
