1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,070
You've got plenty blooming lately
right in your own garden.

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,100
Oh, there's much more to it
than being in full bloom.

3
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,170
When I was darkness at that time

4
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,010
With trembling lips

5
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,100
In a corner of a room I cry

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,180
The more I struggle

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,020
The more this wound deepens

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,180
The broken promise hurt me

9
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,920
Nobody can save me

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,100
God, I have only one request

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,730
Stop tearing apart my love

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,070
I need your love

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,300
I'm a broken rose

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,240
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,410
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

16
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,180
I need your love

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,490
I'm a broken rose

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,420
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

19
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,380
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,360
I wanna need your love

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,590
I'm a broken rose

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,930
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,280
Tsumo!

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,210
Six thousand all.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,750
No way. Come on, give me a break.

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,210
Wow, this guy's really strong.
Though his attitude sucks.

27
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,520
Shit. At least no one can
beat me in Shichi Narabe.

28
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,030
- Shichi Narabe?
- It's popular now.

29
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,260
Among our band members, that is.

30
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,600
Every night during the tour
we play Shichi Narabe.

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,830
It's Naoki's fault for bringing
a pack of cards along.

32
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,870
This isn't some school field trip.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,270
Shichi Narabe?

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,880
The Trapnest members play
this game every night?

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,210
I'm beginning to think that
Shichi Narabe is a really cool game.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,860
And a game Ren's excited about,
saying he won't lose to anyone.

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,030
Is it fun? That Shichi Narabe?

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,000
Huh? You don't know it?

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,500
How can you live life without running
into Shichi Narabe at some point?

40
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,860
I'd like to know too, Shin.

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,160
So do I.

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,140
Teach me how to play Shichi Narabe.
I'm getting tired of Mahjongg.

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,630
Forget it! I've had enough
of Shichi Narabe!

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,650
Hey Shin, what sorta life experience

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,670
have you had to be able to easily
mingle with any group of people?

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,750
He's already talking casually with them.
He's really something.

47
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,210
Shin, if you're tired of Mahjongg,
switch with me.

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll switch with you.
Where's the toilet?

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,220
Over there.

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,720
So even Takumi goes to the toilet!
I'm surprised by the most trivial things.

51
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,350
Oh, no.
There's something wrong with me.

52
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,440
In person, Ren and Takumi were a lot
different from what I had imagined.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,610
Trapnest hardly appears on TV,

54
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,440
so I could only judge them
from their songs and looks.

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
I had assumed them to be
a lot more laid back and cool.

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,750
Especially Takumi.
He's the band leader

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,950
and he's so serious
and composed in interviews.

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,460
How can I put it...
I had created this character

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,650
who was calm and composed
based on what I assumed of him.

60
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,220
But he's more like
a friendly older brother.

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,530
These tomatoes are really delicious.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,810
Where did you get them from?

63
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,240
J-Jun-chan's... ah, my friend's family
grows them. She gave them to me.

64
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,340
Oh? That's nice.

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,780
Tomatoes. Takumi likes tomatoes.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,050
Would you like to take some with you?
There's lots more.

67
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,420
Hmm...

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,490
I'd love to but I can't. We're back on tour
starting the day after tomorrow.

69
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,120
Oh yeah. The tour.

70
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,500
That live concert was really great.

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,270
I'm rooting for you.
I wish you the best of luck.

72
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,940
So cool! He really is
so totally cool in person.

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,810
What can I do? I can't take this.
My body's frozen.

74
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,960
- It must be Yasu.
- He's finally here.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,050
- What took him?
- Hachiko, get the door.

76
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,520
I'll go.

77
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,660
Yasu, long time no see.
How've you been?

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,430
Takumi, what are you doing here?

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,060
Classmates?

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,240
Yeah, we went to
the same junior high school.

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,870
Although we really weren't that close.
I didn't even wanna get close to him.

82
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,540
- What?
- I never knew that either.

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,350
You'd always do stuff
that raised the question,

84
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,840
"As a human being,
should you be doing that?"

85
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,920
It's amazing you never
got sent to juvenile prison.

86
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,450
Unlike you, I'm a delicate person.

87
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,880
Things were hard for me
during my childhood.

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,430
Then we went to different high schools
and started our own bands.

89
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,800
We'd meet at band competitions,

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,670
and it's only after that,
that we became friends.

91
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,970
It's a small town, after all.
Not only at concerts,

92
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,100
but we'd even bump into each other
at music studios.

93
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,310
Around then I used to frequent
live performances,

94
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,410
but I'd say Trapnest left
the strongest impression!

95
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,380
I was especially impressed with
the superb female singer!

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,690
- Just the singer?
- No!

97
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,810
The instrumentals too, of course.

98
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,350
Watch out, Nobu.
Takumi can become violent.

99
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,920
So Nobu's a big fan of Reira.

100
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,620
Oh, really? Then should I
ask Reira to come?

101
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,700
Huh?!

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,060
I'll give her a call.

103
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,820
N-No, but I'll get
really nervous around her.

104
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,070
Besides, she doesn't know
how to play mahjongg.

105
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,100
Don't call her.

106
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,410
Who cares if she doesn't play mahjongg?
I'd love to meet Reira.

107
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,370
Me too.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,410
What about you, Yasu?
Can we invite Reira?

109
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,310
It's fine with me, but I wonder
if she'd wanna come.

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,510
Then I won't tell her that you're here.

111
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,620
Hey!

112
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,850
Wait a minute. What?
What was that all about?

113
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,450
Was there something going on
between you and Reira, Yasu?

114
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,960
No, nothing. Don't worry about it.

115
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,790
- You don't know.
- I don't. What is it?

116
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,560
She won't pick up.
Tough luck, right, Yasu?

117
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,310
These tomatoes are really delicious.

118
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,370
Don't change the subject!

119
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,450
What's the big deal?
It's all in the past now.

120
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,550
Yasu used to go out with Reira.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,450
Wow! I don't believe this!

122
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,750
Yasu and Ren, you've both
been hiding so much!

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,990
Once again, I feel totally left out.

124
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,570
Not intentionally. We just don't talk
about everything that goes on.

125
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,530
You should!

126
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,000
But I went out with her way back when
Ren and I were in our old band.

127
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,470
We broke up before
I even met you guys.

128
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,670
There's no reason for me to tell you.

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,010
You really had
a tough time with Reira.

130
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,650
Not something you'd
wanna talk about.

131
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,410
What do you mean "a tough time"?
Stop adding to the truth.

132
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,810
But she always had her way with you.

133
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,080
That's just in her nature.

134
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
I guess so.

135
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,050
You mean it's in Reira's nature
to have her way with guys?

136
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,260
Well, yeah.

137
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,530
But back then she was
still in high school.

138
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,670
She was really cute
and I also had my eyes on her,

139
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,600
only to have her snatched away
by Yasu. That was tough to accept.

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,570
Oh?

141
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,140
How long were you going out?

142
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,800
Let's not talk about this anymore.
It was for a short while.

143
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,130
But it did last about a year, didn't it?

144
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,510
- That long?
- No, about two years.

145
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,640
That's not a short while at all!

146
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,180
Why did you break up?

147
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,980
I'm not good at defending myself.
Can we stop now?

148
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,150
Why am I feeling so gloomy now?

149
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,490
I was so thrilled when I heard Ren
was Nana's ex-boyfriend.

150
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,030
But it's a big shock to hear
about Yasu and Reira.

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,140
It may have been a long time ago,

152
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,870
but the fact he dated such a pretty,
talented girl.

153
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,110
Naturally, I'm not within his sights.
There's no comparison.

154
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,310
We live in different worlds.

155
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,620
Suddenly, Yasu seems so distant.

156
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,260
But come to think of it,
everyone here lives in

157
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,190
a different world than me,
a commoner.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,620
They're only being friendly with me
because I'm Nana's roommate.

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,230
It's your turn, Hachi.

160
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,930
What's the matter?
You're spacing out.

161
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,140
Sorry!

162
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,740
Playing cards is boring, isn't it?
It's a game for kids.

163
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,250
You're the one who said
you wanted to play?!

164
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,340
Hachiko!

165
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,620
Beer. Didn't we have more?

166
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,110
I put all the beer we got in the fridge.
Are we out already?

167
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,450
We're out of wine too.

168
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,750
Did you drink all of that yourself?!

169
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,980
Good grief.

170
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,480
Nobu, go buy some more.

171
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,950
Beer, wine, sake and shochu.

172
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,460
Why me? I haven't been drinking.

173
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,000
Green Tea
Why me? I haven't been drinking.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,660
Green Tea
Who do you suggest go, then?

175
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,460
Who do you suggest go, then?

176
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,990
Get some cigarettes too, okay?

177
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,430
Shit. Maybe I'll start drinking again.

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Wait, Nobu. I'll go too.

179
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,540
That's gonna be too much
for one person to carry.

180
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,810
Yasu really surprised me.

181
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,680
You know, I was totally shocked.

182
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,090
Oh, right. You like Reira too, right?
She's really pretty.

183
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,990
Huh? No, it's not that.

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,330
I was shocked because
he was keeping it all a secret.

185
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,890
Sure, Reira has a great voice
and she's very pretty,

186
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,920
but I'm not that big of a fan.

187
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,490
To me, she's simply a celebrity.

188
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,900
Is she? But once BLAST goes pro,
you'll be a celebrity too, Nobu.

189
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,230
- You're just waiting for your turn.
- Huh?

190
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,470
What do you mean "Huh"?

191
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,040
It's been your dream to go pro, right?

192
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,650
Well that's true, but...

193
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,550
being called a celebrity
just doesn't ring a bell with me.

194
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,120
I'd love to be recognized
for my guitar skills

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,750
and eventually
make a living with it, but...

196
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,850
I see. You're in this because
you genuinely like to play the guitar.

197
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,050
It's not as if you're doing this
because you wanna become famous.

198
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,990
That's so cool.

199
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,070
A lot different from my perspective.
I'm so into the celebrity hype.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Well, but if I do end up becoming
famous as a result, I'll welcome it.

201
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,360
I'll welcome it too.

202
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,580
Moreover, when I think of this
as a BLAST member,

203
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,280
there's this energy within me that says

204
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
"Just watch me,
I'm gonna make it big."

205
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,090
The fact that Nana and Ren
are back together

206
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,520
has added fuel to Nana's feelings
to catch up with Ren.

207
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,920
And Shin began playing bass
because he admires Ren.

208
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,330
And me too. Ren has
been a target for a long time.

209
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,430
And even Yasu.
He was so insistent not to go pro,

210
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,800
but now he's teamed up with us
in this battle.

211
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,200
Bottom line, we hafta make it big.

212
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,000
We'll defeat Trapnest.

213
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,720
But you know, the fact that
Reira and Yasu used to be a couple

214
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,490
gives you an added sense that
this is a fateful battle

215
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,540
between Trapnest and BLAST.

216
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,260
A fateful battle?
You may be right.

217
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,020
But we haven't even
entered the ring yet.

218
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
I wonder why they broke up.

219
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,440
This is only speculation,
but perhaps it's because

220
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,500
Reira left for Tokyo with the other
Trapnest members to go pro.

221
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,140
Back then, Yasu was studying hard
locally to become a lawyer

222
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,540
and only saw the band as a hobby.

223
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,280
So those two had different objectives.

224
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,170
Maybe they had their own ideas
about the future.

225
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,190
But you know,

226
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,190
if your speculation on the reason
Yasu and Reira broke up is correct,

227
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,160
then they could very well
get back together if they met,

228
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
like Nana and Ren.

229
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,160
No, I'm not sure about that.

230
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,430
I think what happened between
Nana and Ren is unique.

231
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,640
Unique?

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,770
Unique as in special.

233
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,150
Still loving one another after not
hearing from each other for two years

234
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,170
is not something most couples can do.

235
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,540
It's only natural for people's feelings
to change as time goes by.

236
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,120
Besides, I think finding
that someone who you can

237
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,610
feel so strongly connected to
is rare enough.

238
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,060
So you're saying
Nana's met her fateful partner?

239
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,160
- Oh, I love such stories.
- I knew it.

240
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,290
To be honest, I love them too.
Being a romantic guy and all.

241
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,490
You're a romantic guy, Nobu?

242
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,500
Is that something to laugh about?

243
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,640
I hope I can also have
such an encounter someday...

244
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,660
with that kinda partner.

245
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,340
But I'd be satisfied with a happiness
closer to home.

246
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,640
Like with Aki
from the convenience store.

247
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Who's that?

248
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,700
Could Aki from the convenience store
be the cashier just now?

249
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,680
No. She's an imaginative character
whom I feel close to.

250
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
Like Miyo from the tobacco store.

251
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,520
So a virtual Aki and Miyo?
He's the fantasy type, just like me.

252
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,620
This is the first time I've talked about
stuff like this alone with Nobu.

253
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,360
We think alike.
We might just get along well.

254
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,430
Oh, you shouldn't, Nobu.
Didn't you say you quit drinking?

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,160
Nothing good comes
outta drinking, right?

256
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,740
But nothing good happens
even if I don't drink.

257
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,380
My parents have disowned me,
I get sent out to buy the booze,

258
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm weak at mahjongg and I'm short.

259
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,350
I'm not feeling so down anymore.

260
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,920
If I had a boyfriend like Nobu,

261
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,820
I'm sure every day
would be so much fun.

262
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,160
But am I thinking about him
because Yasu is out of my reach?

263
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,500
What's the deal with that?
I keep going after different men.

264
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,000
But it's not like just anyone will do.

265
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Like Jun-chan said,
my surroundings are too bountiful.

266
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,360
I'll ask him.

267
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,310
Say, Nobu, don't you
have a girlfriend?

268
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't.

269
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,540
Presently recruiting
"within-reach characters".

270
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,450
Super within-reach character

271
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,890
Super within-reach character
I might apply.

272
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,880
Super within-reach character

273
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,480
What?! Takumi went home?!

274
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,060
Mhm. He got a call on his cell.

275
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,830
He said it was urgent.
A woman issue, maybe?

276
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,660
Yeah, knowing him I'm sure
it's a woman issue.

277
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,060
He has no morals.

278
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,430
You're one to talk.

279
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,990
Come on! Why didn't you keep him
here until I returned? Nana, you idiot!

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,110
Give up on Takumi, Hachiko.
He seems to be quite the player.

281
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,640
I don't care about that!

282
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,940
You don't care if he's like that.
Then go ahead, do as you please.

283
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,710
That's not what I mean! I wanted
his autograph before he left!

284
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,570
So we're talking at that level.

285
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,510
Don't cry, Hachiko.
I'll get you Takumi's autograph.

286
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,220
Hachiko?

287
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,090
I'm starting to think the nickname
Hachi is actually really cute.

288
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,460
May I have an autograph?!

289
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,360
Autograph Paper
May I have an autograph?!

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,690
Autograph Paper

291
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,930
Autograph Paper
I think she likes me.

292
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,160
Autograph Paper
Will just anyone do?

293
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,630
There were many ups and downs,
but overall this day was special.

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,070
Now that Takumi's gone
Hachi's back to her usual self.

295
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,200
She must've been nervous.

296
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,200
- I was too.
- Liar.

297
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,180
That day, the only thing
Takumi and I really talked about

298
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,170
was Jun-chan's tomatoes.

299
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,550
Still I had a full serving of happiness.

300
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,690
But why is it that there is no limit
to the desires of human beings?

301
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,260
Who could it be? What a pest.
Let me sleep a bit more.

302
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,300
Shin! Wh-What are you doing in my bed?!

303
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,380
It's so comfortable.

304
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,550
Did you do something?!

305
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,740
No way. Because you
won't give me money.

306
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,180
Shin, that's prostitution.

307
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,550
What should I do? He really is
sleeping with women for money.

308
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,830
I knew it but... how can I say it...

309
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,230
He is a young man of that certain age,

310
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,290
and he's handsome so naturally
he'd be popular among the women.

311
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,070
I thought it was just
the process of him growing up.

312
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,330
But for him to say he's not interested
unless he gets paid for it?

313
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,540
Is it really okay not to
do anything about it?

314
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,170
There's only Nobu here.

315
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,970
What about Yasu?
Has he gone home?

316
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,750
But it looks like someone tidied up.
Did Yasu clean up?

317
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,620
He's such a great guy.

318
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,980
What about Nana and Ren?

319
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,530
Do not disturb!

320
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,100
The phone.

321
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,570
Oh, hello, Nana? Thank goodness.
I called a number of times

322
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,870
but you wouldn't answer
so I was getting concerned.

323
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,840
You had so much to drink

324
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,440
so I feared you wouldn't be able to
get up on your own.

325
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
I've been calling you
since this morning.

326
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,340
Were you able to get up okay?

327
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,310
Mhm. Thanks. I just got up now.

328
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,450
Well, you do work
for a publishing firm,

329
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,880
so I guess it's not a big deal
if you start work in the afternoon.

330
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,320
It's not okay!!

331
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,830
Do you have hay fever?

332
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,260
Oh, you have a cold.
Are you feeling all right?

333
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,830
You didn't hafta come
if you're not feeling well.

334
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,940
Or in fact, you don't
hafta come back anymore.

335
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,150
Ms. Sakagami!

336
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,150
The Chief says I'm fired!

337
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,480
- Naturally.
- Huh?

338
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,690
No way. Ms. Sakagami.
Although you were hard on me,

339
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,710
I thought you were the kinda person
who would stand up for me in the end.

340
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,620
Do you think the world exists for you?!

341
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,930
It's a result of how spoiled
you've been acting. Farewell.

342
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,040
If I get thirsty, I can simply
buy a can of coffee for 120 yen.

343
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,280
However, I like having my coffee
in a cute café.

344
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,110
I wanna live in a fancy room.

345
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,410
Wear clothes that are in style.
See the popular movies.

346
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,230
Buy the latest cell phone.
Get a driver's license.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,460
Travel overseas.

348
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,590
So I need to find a job.
I need to work hard.

349
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,800
If I think I'm doing it for all that,
working can be fun.

350
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,770
But is it still not enough?

351
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,220
No matter how many things
I can think of that I want,

352
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,810
I can't even find the strength
to get up from here.

353
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,460
Just one thing would do.
If only I had that something

354
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,090
that I could willingly devote
all of my energy to.

355
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,960
Unidentified Caller

356
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,670
- Yes?
- Nana?

357
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,830
It's me, Takumi.

358
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,240
Do you have a moment to talk?

359
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,250
Sure.

360
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,230
Sorry about yesterday.

361
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,550
You went through all that preparation,
yet I left without thanking you.

362
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,680
I wanted to thank you properly
so I got your number from Ren.

363
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,750
Thank you for coming. Sorry I couldn't
prepare you something nicer.

364
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,050
You're quite the chef.

365
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,920
The food was delicious. Thank you.

366
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,700
Are you still at work?
Sorry to bother you while you're busy.

367
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,940
No, it's okay. I was wandering around
without anything to do anyway.

368
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,660
Wandering around?
Where are you now?

369
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,740
Omotesando.

370
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,210
Huh? Seriously?

371
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,980
I'm in Omotesando too.
I'm stuck in traffic.

372
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,940
No way.

373
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,010
Where about?

374
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,670
I'm driving towards Harajuku, .,
well I'm not moving at the moment.

375
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,310
Towards Harajuku?
That's the opposite lane.

376
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,080
The traffic is at a standstill.
I'm stopped in front of Gucci.

377
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,190
Which kinda car?

378
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,520
A black Gelandewagen.

379
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,660
A gelen... what?
I don't know it. What's it like?

380
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,100
A Mercedes Benz, 4WD.

381
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,160
It's a big car, so it should be
easy to spot.

382
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,730
I got it! There it is!

383
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,270
Come over.

384
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,900
That was the beginning of summer
when I was twenty.

385
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,940
Let's take a side road
and go somewhere. Are you hungry?

386
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,080
The only way I could fill the emptiness
inside me was to fall in love.

387
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,860
Hachiko is late.

388
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,890
I guess we can eat first.

389
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,290
She may be doing us a favor.

390
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,990
Since you put that
"do not disturb" sign up.

391
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,990
That Hachiko really is a loyal dog
who knows what to do.

392
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,070
Unlike those two stray dogs there.

393
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,570
You got that right.

394
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,930
I wonder how long
they plan on staying.

395
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,150
Back then, Nana, everything about
the world surrounding you

396
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,340
seemed so bright and shiny.

397
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,520
It's not like just anyone will do.

398
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,190
I wanted to be bathed
in the same light.

399
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,790
I reached into the sky

400
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:19,300
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

401
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,680
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

402
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,670
Like colorful balloons

403
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm alone

404
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,520
My hand had no place to go

405
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,150
And gently you took it

406
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,330
Starless night

407
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,530
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

408
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,330
I want to feel your warmth

409
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,210
Tears are falling down

410
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,310
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

411
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,810
Of your hand holding mine
