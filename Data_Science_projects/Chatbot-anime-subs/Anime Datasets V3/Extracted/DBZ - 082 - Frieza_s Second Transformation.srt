00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,190
"Attack, Goku!! An Enraged Freeza's
Second Transformation"

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,990
Incredible! He's holding his own
against Freeza!

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,180
No, he's doing better!

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,290
You really are incredible, Piccolo-san!

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:28,840
Just what the hell has happened? It hasn't been that
long since he was defeated on Earth!

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,340
We might actually be able to get out of
this without dying, Gohan!

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,460
Right!

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,380
Beat that Freeza, who killed so many of
us, using the power of Nail-san!

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,820
What kind of training has Piccolo undergone?
That's the way, stick with him until I get better!

10
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,310
Kaio-sama, with Piccolo powered-up as
much as he is, can he defeat Freeza?

11
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,780
If he doesn't beat him for us, we're screwed!

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,110
So fast! And I should have the
advantage of speed!

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,170
Kuririn-san...

14
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,740
How can this be? You mean, he hasn't
been taking this seriously up until now?

15
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,550
What's the best step for me to take now?
What should I do?

16
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,460
Damn you for making us rejoice prematurely!

17
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,130
Nail-san...

18
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,160
Piccolo! What kind of guy is this Freeza!?

19
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,300
Piccolo...

20
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,430
Kaio-sama?

21
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I told you, they have touched that
which should not be touched...

22
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,770
Piccolo...

23
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,240
Sorry about that just now. I didn't give
you enough credit.

24
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,280
But you are capable of more than I imagined.
I decided to show you some true power.

25
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,290
Which is to say, my true power.

26
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,330
There's no end to his power!
Was I really planning to fight against him?

27
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,860
So will I. Let's make this genuine.

28
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,190
What's that?

29
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
You're saying you haven't been serious
up until now?

30
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,080
I didn't realize that Namekians told
fish stories.

31
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
You'll find out very soon.

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,750
You worthless fool! To have to resort
to bluffing at this stage...

33
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,520
l- I get it!

34
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,350
Piccolo's been fighting with that heavy
turban and mantle on all this time?

35
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,930
Now realize the fury of all the Namekians
who were killed by you!!

36
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,780
Piccolo's Ki is getting stronger again.
This strength is the real thing!

37
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,780
He can win! Piccolo-san can win!

38
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,110
Piccolo! We're counting on you!

39
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,650
The situation has changed again!

40
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,520
You've removed those heavy garments
and made yourself lighter...

41
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,660
which is supposed to mean your speed
has become even more polished?

42
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,790
We'll have to see.

43
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,080
It will take more than this to satisfy the
fury of the Namekians!

44
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,100
He did it!

45
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,190
Gohan!

46
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,330
Kuririn-san!

47
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,140
Nail-san!

48
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,280
Nice going, Piccolo-san!

49
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,140
That's the way!

50
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,150
At this rate, Kakarrot may still be in time.

51
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,190
In which case, I may get out of this alive!

52
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,290
And now to finish you off!

53
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,350
Has Freeza... ?

54
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,860
You don't suppose... ?

55
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,590
Look there!

56
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,480
As tenacious as I expected.

57
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,220
You seem to be laboring under some false
impression concerning my true power.

58
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,780
What!?

59
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,500
Did you really think that what I just showed
you was serious?

60
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,900
You couldn't have known I'd transformed
myself, could you?

61
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,810
Transformed, you say?

62
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,020
I will allow you the same thing I gave to
Vegeta and the others...

63
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,380
A feeling of absolute terror towards me.

64
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,980
All right, first I will instill a sense
of hopelessness.

65
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,250
A hopelessness from knowing that nothing
you can possibly do will help!!

66
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,170
Every time l, Freeza, transform myself, my
power substantially grows!

67
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,760
And I still have two more
transformations remaining!

68
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Do you know what that means?

69
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,540
What's this?

70
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,440
Impossible!

71
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,620
Gohan, what did he just say?

72
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,160
Freeza can transform two more times.

73
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,790
Now getting married is completely out.

74
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,600
So then, let me show it to you.

75
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,710
You guys should feel honored. You're the first
ones I've ever shown this transformation to!

76
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,260
Watch carefully now! Here comes
Freeza-sama's second-stage transformation!

77
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,990
I apologize for the delay. Now then, shall we
begin the battle once again?

78
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,450
Y- You monster!

79
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,070
H- He hasn't changed all that much, has he?

80
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,750
Idiot! Try probing what his latent power is!
It's completely different from a moment ago!

81
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,740
Yet he's settled down again, and he's
regained his presence of mind!

82
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,580
He's also lost the damage that Piccolo-san
had inflicted on him!

83
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,960
Damn it all! What's going on out there? That
Ki of Freeza's has gotten stronger again!

84
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,370
At this point, even once I completely recover,
I might not be able to beat him. Now what?

85
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,340
Freeza is a super-monster
beyond imagination!

86
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,470
You had such confidence in your speed
earlier, did you not?

87
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,570
So then, shall we have another look at it?

88
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,570
You bastard! If you've got the power, I've got the speed!
You won't catch up to me in this lifetime!

89
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,770
l- It can't be!

90
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,570
My goodness, it has been too long,
my little toddler.

91
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,010
Piccolo-san has lost his speed advantage
over Freeza!

92
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,580
Does that mean Freeza's power has gone up
that much?

93
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,460
Don't lose, Nail-san!

94
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,410
Thank goodness, you aren't dead! I'll heal
you right away!

95
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,750
That's right!

96
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,320
There's still that trick!

97
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,450
It's all over now, isn't it?

98
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,710
Piccolo...

99
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,480
Shall we put an end to this play, then?

100
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,160
D- Damn...

101
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,640
You have realized that, unfortunately enough,
the speed you took such pride in

102
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,430
is of utterly no use against me now,
have you not?

103
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,570
I would have you give up now!

104
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,710
S- So fast!

105
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,720
Piccolo-san!

106
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,580
They're impossibly fast! There's no way
he can dodge them!

107
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,420
Piccolo-san...

108
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,440
Piccolo!

109
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,450
Piccolo!

110
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,510
Stop it!

111
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,470
Gohan!

112
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,340
Gohan! Dammit!

113
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,480
Wait!

114
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,350
What are you doing, Vegeta!?

115
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,010
There's no sense for you to go!

116
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,020
B- But if I don't...

117
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,460
Listen here, at this rate, we're all going to be
killed by Freeza!

118
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,460
Never mind him, you blast me half-to-death!
Do it now!

119
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,230
Once I get that kid to heal me, and rise
from a near-death state one more time,

120
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm certain to be able to become a
Super Saiyan!

121
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,320
Having transformed a second time, Freeza
has become even more powered-up.

122
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,370
Piccolo faces a great pinch, as Gohan leaps
to his aid. How will this turn out?
