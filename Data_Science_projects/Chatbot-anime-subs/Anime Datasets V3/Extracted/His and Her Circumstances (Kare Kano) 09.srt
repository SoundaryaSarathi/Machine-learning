1
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:04,032
What's happened so far!

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:06,563
Our sister, the masked model
student Miyazawa Yukino...

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,702
...had been the ultimate queen of vanity.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,074
Arima, the one who changed her...

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,500
...is an industrious model student who

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,003
tries to bear all his sorrows by himself.

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,344
They were affected by each other's lives,

8
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,975
and after repeated fuss, established a relationship.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,011
They decided to live solely for their

11
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,645
own real happiness from that point forward.

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,361
But the world isn't that simple or generous.

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,131
It forced them to become super-busy,
as though challenging their relationship...

15
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,465
Starting with the school event which made them

16
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,300
not see each other: the Athletics Festival.

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,769
In order to carry his ambition of

18
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,403
the Asaba Mary-Land Project...

19
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,240
...a guy attempted to demoralize Sis
and possibly break them up.

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,610
This delinquent, perverted hunk, is Asaba Hideaki.

23
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,440
Their final exam grades

24
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,608
were the result of yielding

25
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,105
to their love-power and goofing off.

26
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,140
Sis's one-sided feeling of estrangement
occurred because of this.

27
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,145
And on top of it all, 

28
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,712
there was interference and
pressure from the teachers at school.

29
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,277
And so on, 

30
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,917
the various difficulties continued

31
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,020
to rise to impede them.

32
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,755
Go for it, Miyazawa Yukino!

33
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,561
Don't lose heart, Arima Souichirou!

35
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:07,732
This world exists for you!
But... however!

36
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:09,531
Hey, did you hear?

37
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,028
About Arima and Miyazawa?

38
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,063
Their grades really slid at finals.

39
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,405
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,003
Aren't they going out ?

41
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,770
They got called into the

42
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,612
Student Guidance Room and got lectured.

43
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,571
Whoa!

44
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,540
What's more...I hear they rebelled

45
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,576
against the teachers...and their
parents got called in to school!

46
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,113
No way, for real?!

47
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,924
I wonder what happened to them?

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,350
Yeah.

49
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,549
I'm so sleepy.

50
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,049
I'm still feeling last night's all-nighter.

51
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,558
There was this one math
problem I just couldn't solve.

52
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,954
I wonder what I'm doing wrong?

54
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,193
I've been thinking about it ever since...

55
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:10,761
Miyazawa!

56
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:16,200
Is Home Ec. this afternoon in
sewing room #1 in the old building?

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:15,669
Yeah.

58
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:16,726
Whatcha looking at ?

59
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,831
Oh, Math?

60
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,439
Yeah... there's this one problem
I just can't figure out.

61
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,534
Wow, that even happens to you, Miyazawa?

63
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,803
Oh, there's something I didn't understand, either.

64
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:26,941
Can I ask you about it?

65
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,906
Sure, if I know how to solve it.

66
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,383
I'm just not

67
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,446
"one of the girls," am I?

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,652
I talk with everybody,

69
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,351
but there's none of them whom I'm really close to.

71
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,717
It's been a long time since I stopped
playing the model student...

72
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:45,429
...but everyone still treats me like a guest.

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,891
Well, it can't be helped.

74
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,200
That's how I was until now.

75
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,966
Others can't adjust

76
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,667
if you suddenly become normal.

77
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,303
Arima!

78
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:57,903
Math?

79
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,537
Which problem?

80
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,209
R...r...right here!

81
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:02,807
This one.

82
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,073
Hey!
Asama-kun!

83
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,577
What're you doing? Let's go have lunch.

84
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,189
What the hell?!

85
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,552
I was wondering why you weren't coming
and here you are playing with the babes?!

87
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:13,982
I'm not like you.

88
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,788
Disgusting!
You sex fiend!

89
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:16,925
I said I'm not like you.

91
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,367
You made me wait out in the
blazing sun at the entryway all this time!

92
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,925
So why didn't you just wait in the hall?

93
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,766
You meanie!  You're always so mean to me!

94
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,335
Sorry to stop in the middle...

95
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,708
I'll take my time to explain later, okay?

96
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,105
Oh...

97
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:31,909
Um...

98
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,384
Sure...Th...those three really get along well.

99
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,514
Yeah, they're always with each other.

100
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,817
It sure is different once you start going out.

101
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,985
Arima's always been nice,

102
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,087
but he was never especially friendly with the girls...

104
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,589
...and Asaba's never treated any one person specially...

106
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,698
Oh, let's go have lunch, too.

107
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,602
Ok, want to go to the mini-mart afterwards?

108
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:32,471
Sounds great!

109
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,674
Hey, have you heard about

110
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:45,780
the legend of the kendo club?

111
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,877
Huh, what's that?  Never heard of it.

112
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,786
Our kendo club's really strong ...

113
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,748
...so they're always going to
practice meets at other schools.  Yeah.

114
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,919
So all schools would cheer

115
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,194
for their own teams, right?

116
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,326
But whenever it was Arima's turn

117
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,495
they start cheering for our school!
*Go Hokuei!  Go Hokuei!*

118
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,268
That's awesome!

119
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,535
But I can totally see why!

120
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,337
A hot guy comes
before school spirit!

124
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:11,168
I hear all the girls in 1-F
went with Asaba to Disneyland!

125
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:11,968
WHAT?

126
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,108
How lucky!  No fair!

127
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,414
Arima and Asaba sure get along well.

128
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,180
They're so picturesque when
they stand next to each other.

129
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,982
They're like the valiant hunk

130
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,116
and the delinquent hunk.

131
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,215
Miyazawa's really lucky,

132
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,054
being friends with those two.

133
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,415
Naturally, when she's so perfect.

134
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,554
I bet I could make friends with those two.

135
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,026
She's pretty and kind,
and not arrogant about being smart...

137
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,434
And always helps us with everything so nicely.

138
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,768
I guess perfect people really exist.

139
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:37,862
I don't know.

140
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,032
Maho...

141
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,840
Is Miyazawa really as nice a
person as you all say she is?

143
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,210
Couldn't it be that you're all just being deceived?

144
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,335
What?

145
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,210
What're you talking about, Maho?!

146
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,247
I always thought that girl was fishy.

148
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,547
So perfect at anything she does.

149
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,284
Isn't she just a brown noser?

150
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,246
What?

151
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,180
I don't know.

152
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,950
But her attitude's changed lately.

154
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,652
Maybe she's slipping and showing her true nature.

155
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,427
What?

156
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,091
But don't you think Miyazawa's

158
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,560
different from before?

159
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,435
Kii, you think so, too?

160
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,794
Actually, I was
thinking the same thing!

161
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,935
No way!
Me, too!

162
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:14,933
Me, too!

164
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,809
What?  So everyone was thinking that way?

165
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,877
There are women like that, you know...

166
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,075
...pretending they're all virtuous...

167
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,986
...taking everyone in, and cunningly
getting around in the world.

168
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,784
People like that are good at catching guys, too.

169
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,956
Guys are suckers for that type.

170
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:38,394
Doesn't it look like she "chose well"
by getting both Arima and Asaba?

172
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,872
If...If that's true,

173
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,774
I can't put up with it.

174
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:54,979
Yeah.

175
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,017
There were lots of girls who
liked Arima and Asaba.

176
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,018
If this is true, we can't forgive her.

177
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,045
That's right !

178
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,954
I know lots of girls who tried

179
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,221
and failed to tell them they liked them.

180
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,115
I feel sorry for them !

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,549
We were able to suck it up

182
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,223
because she was so perfect...

183
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,957
How could she deceive us ?

184
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,295
If that's how it is,

185
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,628
I'd rather have them be
taken by somebody else!

188
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,166
This looks like it's going to be fun.

189
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,547
I'm late.

190
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:44,895
This is the right room...

191
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,031
Why isn't anyone here?

192
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,194
Something's wrong. I'll try asking the teachers.

193
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,379
So sewing was canceled

194
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:03,977
and became study hall?

195
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,121
I went to the classroom,

196
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,591
and I was surprised that no one was there.

197
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,119
I couldn't figure it out,

198
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,727
so I went and asked the teachers.

199
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,160
Huh?

200
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:24,694
Oh, I know.

201
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,567
Want to go back to doing that math problem?

202
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,302
No, we got it already.

203
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,474
You stopped getting it because all
you do is fool around with guys.

205
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:43,188
Oh. I see.

206
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,337
Did you see Miyazawa's face ?

207
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,777
She turned so pale, the poor thing.

208
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,507
She's had it so good up until now,

209
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,572
she should suffer a bit.

210
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,643
Really, she stands out too much...

211
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,449
...just because she's a little popular with the guys.

212
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,614
Her looks sure aren't anything to write home about.

213
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,747
You're much prettier, Maho.

214
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,417
You should rule the whole class again,

215
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,951
just like in junior high.

216
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,952
You were so cool, Maho!

217
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,921
I guess.

218
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:31,227
Miyazawa?

219
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,127
Hm?

220
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,666
What's wrong ? You look upset.

221
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,707
No, I just didn't get enough sleep.

222
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:36,904
Should I do the rest?

223
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:37,868
I'm fine, don't worry.

224
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,713
I can guess why this happened.

225
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,740
It's because I'm friends with Arima and Asaba...

226
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,679
...and stopped pretending
to be the model student...

228
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,249
This is what I get for
deceiving people all this time.

229
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:52,890
It's no wonder they hate me.

230
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,594
The karma for deceiving them
without any desire for making friends...

232
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,522
...and making them praise me
and getting a kick out of it...

233
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,124
...is all coming back to me now.

234
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,771
ALL RIGHT!
The time for feeling sorry is OVER !

235
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,783
Nothing's going to get done if I keep brooding.

236
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,411
There's no use crying over spilt milk.

237
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,079
I should at least take it with dignity.

238
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,152
"After all, this is the real beginning for the real me !"

240
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,072
I have nothing to do.

241
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,334
It's been several days since
they started ignoring me.

242
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,444
This was a sudden fall from the
glory I had previously attained.

244
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,175
Almost like a politician after his downfall.

245
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,589
But that's unavoidable.

246
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,851
When I exposed the fact that I wasn't elegant
or perfect without hiding it...

248
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,659
...a rebound like this was inevitable.

249
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,924
I knew it was risky.

250
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,698
But I didn't want to
live in pretense anymore.

252
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,503
I have to climb over this wall myself.

253
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,094
So I thought, but...

254
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,270
With them all ignoring me so completely,

255
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,835
I don't have any cards to play with...

256
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,245
I can't figure out where to begin fixing things.

257
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,226
She's so pretty!

258
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,328
I didn't know there was
anyone like that in our school.

259
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,394
I wonder why I never noticed?

260
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,770
Hi, Tsubasa. Did you go to the teachers' offices?

261
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:53,673
I met her.

262
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:54,772
What?  Who?

263
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,479
Miyazawa Yukino.

264
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,976
Oh, the one going out with Arima?

265
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,842
She didn't look so hot.

266
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,786
Why does Arima want someone like her?

267
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,985
I bet it's because she's intellectual.

268
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,193
Arima's not some dummy who'd
pick a girl just for her looks.

270
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,492
SHUT UP!
I didn't ask you to reach a conclusion!

272
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,525
Ooh, scary.

273
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,524
This certainly wasn't in my plans.

274
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,863
I get hospitalized right after
getting into high school...

275
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,200
...and when I get out,

276
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,004
Arima's got a girlfriend.

277
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:27,139
What about my feelings, after I've
cared for Arima all this time?

279
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:31,946
I'll crush them.

280
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:32,818
Huh?

281
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,282
I'll crush them!

282
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,655
I don't care what dirty tricks I have to use!

283
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,317
I'LL DESTROY THEM!

284
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,302
Miyazawa.

285
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,306
It's that pretty girl I ran into earlier.

286
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,246
Oh, you haven't met before. I'll introduce you.

287
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,617
This is Shibahime from 1-D.

288
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,314
We were in the same junior high.

289
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,322
She's been hospitalized for a long time.

290
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,714
She came back to school the day before yesterday.

291
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,923
Arima, this is the first time I've ever
seen you being this familiar with a girl.

293
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,360
This is Miyazawa. We're going out.

294
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,602
Nice to meet you. I'm Shibahime Tsubasa.

295
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,164
Oh, hi. I'm Miyazawa Yukino.

296
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,712
What are you going? Miyazawa?

297
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:42,582
I don't know.
Miyazawa suddenly slapped my hand away.

299
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:45,983
Her notebooks...

300
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,594
Shibahime!

301
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:52,695
Miyazawa...

302
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,225
Miyazawa pushed me down!

303
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,134
How could she?
Why would she do such a thing?

305
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,228
U...umm...

306
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,205
Oh, a cat.

307
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,834
Shibahime, what're you doing?!

308
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,125
What were you trying to do?!  Huh?!

309
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:32,597
U...umm...

310
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,974
Why're you doing this?!

311
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,902
Ow ow owwwww...
I didn't do anything!

313
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:39,768
Liar!

314
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,407
There's no way Miyazawa
would do something like that!

315
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,377
Sorry, Miyazawa.

316
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,544
She wouldn't normally do stuff like this...

317
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,320
...but it looks like her temper
got sour while she was in the hospital.

318
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:51,851
You okay ?

319
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,259
And you, come over here and apologize.

320
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,717
There's a limit to how far you can go with pranks.

321
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,062
Yeah yeah, I'm SO very very sorry.

322
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,793
Oh, don't worry about it.

323
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:04,194
But you were in the hospital
for a long time, weren't you?

324
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,328
Isn't it bad for you if you move around like that?

325
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,140
Um, kind of...

326
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,571
She crashed into a stone wall on her skateboard...

327
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,872
...got buried under the rubble...

328
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,770
...and wasn't found all night.

329
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,879
But if she can move around
this much, she's probably fine.

330
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,124
In junior high, everyone envied me.

332
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,071
Because Arima was especially friendly to me alone.

334
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,471
You skipped out on clean-up again, didn't you?

335
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,167
I know you did!

336
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, it's all right.

337
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,174
I'm cute, so they'll do it for me.

339
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,049
I swear, you're hopeless.

340
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,106
Don't look at somebody else like that.

341
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,071
Don't belong to someone like that. Don't go.

342
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:19,436
Oh, I know.

343
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,846
If you've been hospitalized for
so long, I bet classes are rough.

344
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,075
I still have some copies of the study guides...

346
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,477
...so if you want, I can bring you a set.

347
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:33,583
Why you little...!

348
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,120
Humph!
Mind your own business!

349
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,523
All you do is suck up to your girlfriend!

350
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:39,729
You sure have changed!

351
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,690
Quit lecturing me like you know everything!

352
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,433
Why don't you just go and curl
up in your girlfriend's lap?

353
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,966
Don't ever speak to me again, it's too embarassing!
Bah-bye!

355
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,473
What the heck's wrong with her ?

356
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,177
I see... she likes Arima...

357
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,738
And here I thought it would
be nice to see Shibahime again...


359
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,184
What the heck was she so upset about?

360
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,077
He's so dense...

361
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,146
Sorry, Miyazawa.

362
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,848
Looks like I've caused you some trouble...

363
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,884
But I've cared about Shibahime for a long time.

365
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,919
I thought, if I had a sister, she'd be like her.

366
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,890
I know he only thought of me like a sister.

367
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,232
That was just fine.

368
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,531
Until he fell in love with someone else.

370
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,000
You bit off more than you could chew.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,515
There there.

372
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,242
It can't be helped.

373
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,478
Arima never saw Tsubasa
as a potential love interest.

375
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,787
So what ?

376
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,590
She can still monopolize Arima that way.

377
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,786
There's no use now.

378
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,919
Arima's feelings totally belong to that girl.

380
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,854
He won't pay attention to me any more.

381
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,196
Don't be such a chicken...

382
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,067
I can't stand it!  I hate her!

383
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,043
Gack!  Tsubasa!

384
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,615
Tsubasa, what're you doing?!

385
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,787
Tsubasa...

386
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,257
Is she a demon of revenge ?

387
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,788
U...Umm...

388
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,828
You don't even know a thing about Arima!

390
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:23,760
Tsubasa...

391
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,363
Shibahime totally hates me.

392
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:30,376
Ignored by all the girls in my class, 
hated by Shibahime...

394
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm really not doing so hot these days...

396
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:38,708
Miyazawa?

397
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,879
Sorry for all the trouble Shibahime's causing.

399
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,720
We're her friends...

400
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,618
Please understand her feelings.

401
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:50,826
It's really complicated for her.

402
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,688
Oh, sure. I don't mind.

403
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,459
She hasn't done anything
that bad to me... I'm okay.

405
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:57,899
What a relief to hear you say that.

406
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,735
Thanks.

407
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:00,562
Don't mention it.

408
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,631
Anyway, we'll try to keep her out of trouble,

410
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,908
so please don't be offended.

411
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,777
If anything happens, just let us know.

412
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:08,540
Bye bye. See ya.

413
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:09,576
Bye bye.

414
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,221
Lucky...that girl has friends.

415
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,303
Hey, how long are we going to keep doing this?

416
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,535
What, are you siding with Miyazawa?

417
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:43,108
Laughter, Fury, Anxiety, Love, Friendship

418
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,981
Rivalry, Gowth and Degeneration

419
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,284
Within the doors of the classroom...

420
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,723
...are all emotions.

421
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:53,943
What'll happen next !

422
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,285
Surrounded by enemies...

423
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,884
...Sis is ostracized by the new characters

424
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,383
as they appear one after the other.

425
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,192
But the deadlock comes to an end.

426
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:01,993
Yes, Shibahime Tsubasa goes

427
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,727
in for the kill!

428
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,255
Next time on KareKano:

429
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,225
Everything Starts Now.
