00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:25,951
What are you doing there?

2
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:29,717
H- huh? Who are you?

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,891
Me?

4
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,222
I am...

5
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:37,562
Scratch... scratch... scratch...

6
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:40,232
Eh, there's a mosquito...

7
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:41,900
A mosquaito...

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,902
'skaito...

9
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:45,995
Kaio!

10
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:50,575
Then, who is... huh?

11
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,669
That there is my pet,
Bubbles-<i>kun</i>.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,171
Ohhh...

13
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,518
I thought it was a little strange.

14
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,509
You're the strange one.

15
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,348
By the way...

16
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,094
Don't you think that play on words
just now was the greatest?

17
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,358
You don't have to be
afraid to laugh at it.

18
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,853
At what?

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,872
You were too tense to hear it, huh?

20
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,875
What am I going to do
with you, for pity's sake?

21
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,367
Well then, at no extra charge,
I'll hit you with a different play on words.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,745
Hello? Hello?

23
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,387
Huh? I picked up the <i>phone</i>,
but no one was <i>home</i>!

24
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,898
That's great!

25
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,887
What was?

26
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:55,271
What did you come here for?

27
00:01:56,508 --> 00:02:00,410
Oh, I was hoping to have you
train me, Kaio-<i>sama</i>.

28
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,578
Train you!?

29
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,116
Go home now!

30
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:09,187
Anyone who hears a joke like that
and doesn't laugh has a flawed character!

31
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,678
You expect me to train
anyone like that!?

32
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:18,730
That was hilarious! I should have
expected as much, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

33
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,699
I ain't ever heard anything so funny!

34
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:25,870
It was, wasn't it?

35
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,540
You were just slow
to notice it, that's all.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,871
Are you going to train me?

37
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,880
Train you, huh?
I wouldn't mind doing that.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,215
Really!?

39
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,883
Provided that...

40
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,647
...you can pass my test.

41
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:46,558
You have to make me, Kaio-<i>sama</i>,
the mastermind of gags,

42
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:49,220
laugh at one of your plays on words.

43
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,657
I have to make a play on words!?

44
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,099
Are you getting cold feet?

45
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,331
If the pun is not at an adequate
enough level, I won't laugh at it.

46
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,169
Well, how about it?

47
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,674
Apparently, you're not up to it.
If that's so, then give up, and go home!

48
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,184
M- my <i>futon</i>...

49
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:15,175
<i>flew</i> away, <i>gone</i>!

50
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:21,189
Your <i>futon</i>... <i>flew</i> away <i>gone</i>!?

51
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,531
<i>Just a little more!</i>

52
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,866
My feline...

53
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,027
...has gone supine!

54
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:36,439
My stylus is sightless!

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,611
Ah, you laughed!
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you laughed!

56
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,210
My <i>futon flew</i> away, <i>gone</i>!

57
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:01,158
You're no slouch at this, huh?
You're a pro, aren't you?

58
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:06,004
Very well, I will give you
my training. I will teach you...

59
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,336
...my greatest gag!

60
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:14,512
N- never mind the gags,
teach me martial arts.

61
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:19,184
What, you want to learn martial arts?
Why didn't you say so sooner?

62
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:23,848
All right, come at me! I want to see
what kind of skill you possess.

63
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,194
What's the matter!?

64
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,463
It's just that there's
something strange going on.

65
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:34,866
It's awfully hard to move,
and my body feels so heavy.

66
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:38,324
Where did you come from, Earth?

67
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,207
Then it would be heavy here, huh?

68
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:46,211
This is a small planet,
but it has incredible gravity, see?

69
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:49,547
I'll bet it's about ten times
what it is on your planet.

70
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:53,039
That means your own weight
is ten times greater.

71
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,156
See how high you can jump.
As hard as you can.

72
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:59,145
O- okay...

73
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,489
It's no use! That little bit
is as high as I can go!

74
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,838
<i>lf he can jump that high</i>
<i>in ten times his normal gravity...</i>

75
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,705
<i>This guy here has a lot of promise!</i>

76
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,848
Okay then, we will start your training.

77
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:27,185
How much time do you plan
to spend with me?

78
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:32,190
I ain't sure how many days it took
for me to run down the Serpentine Road...

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,859
But I don't think I have much time.

80
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,862
I'm told that there are these
Saiyan guys who are coming to our

81
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:40,198
planet to do some awful stuff.

82
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:44,658
So I'd like for you to train me
until that time, however short it is!

83
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,371
Saiyans, huh?

84
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:51,206
You've had some nasty folks set their
sights on you, all right. Well then...

85
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,812
I'll check into when these Saiyans
are going to reach Earth for you.

86
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,886
The Saiyans are flying
that way, all right.

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,173
They will arrive on Earth in...
let's see... about 158 days, I'd say.

88
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,176
Awesome! You can tell that!?

89
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:30,273
Yeah, these handy antenna
are reliable, <i>an' tenna</i> some!

90
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,513
That was great!

91
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,851
Maybe I should give up training you.

92
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,529
That was great! That was great!
That was great!

93
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,863
Wasn't it?

94
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:51,469
Still, there's only 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive, huh?

95
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,530
Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

96
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,711
Me training you on this planet
for 158 days will have the same value

97
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:04,148
as if you trained for
a thousand years on Earth.

98
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,149
Really!?

99
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,484
However...

100
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,319
Even if you do train with me,

101
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,155
there's no guarantee that you
will be able to beat the Saiyans.

102
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:16,718
The two Saiyans that are headed for Earth
have just that much awesome power.

103
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:21,158
To be honest with you, their strength
is even greater than my own.

104
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,835
Even greater than yours, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!?

105
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,503
That's right.

106
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:29,007
Which means that if you
cannot at least surpass me,

107
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:32,408
it will be impossible
for you to beat the Saiyans.

108
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,074
Okay then, how about
we get started right away?

109
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:42,342
Hey! Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

110
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,130
First off...

111
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,301
...you have to conquer the harsh gravity here.
Catch Bubbles-<i>kun</i> here, if you can.

112
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,971
For the time being, until you can
move fast enough to do that,

113
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,632
nothing else will matter.

114
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,145
A- all right...

115
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,579
Okay, run away, Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

116
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:15,782
Wait up!

117
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,996
Damn! My body is really heavy!

118
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,834
Dammit! All right, then...

119
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:39,999
Watch this!

120
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,516
I'm going to get you!

121
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:57,594
Ho! So he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

122
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,365
That makes me quite a bit lighter, now!

123
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,880
Hold it!

124
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,881
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

125
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,223
All right, you're mine!

126
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,901
It can't be!
You're kidding me, right?

127
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,575
What do you think?

128
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:49,580
He sure is fast!
I'm not sure I can catch him.

129
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,071
If you can't,
then go home right now.

130
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:59,312
That's right- I ain't eaten anything
since I left the Snake Princess' place.

131
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:03,349
Say, I hate to ask, but could you
give me something to eat?

132
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,435
Well, okay. That's unusual-
a hungry deceased person...

133
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,566
Hey, how about showing
a little restraint?

134
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,227
I'm <i>down</i>ing the <i>donburi</i>!

135
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,067
<i>Down</i>ing the <i>donburi</i>!

136
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,729
Where's the joke there?

137
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,144
I'm full, I'm full!

138
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:56,514
The taste notwithstanding,
at least my stomach is full!

139
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:01,042
I get the feeling that maybe this man
isn't giving me enough respect.

140
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:03,688
By the way, Kaio-<i>sama</i>,

141
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,021
I'm surprised you don't find it dull
staying on a planet this small.

142
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,862
So young...

143
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:15,856
If you set your mind to it, there are
any number of fun things to do here.

144
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:20,705
Like counting how many blades
of grass there are growing...

145
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,874
gazing up at the sky...

146
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,707
long-distance peeing...

147
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:31,375
Recently, I've been
getting into a new hobby...

148
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,408
Going for drives.

149
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,895
Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles-<i>kun</i>.

150
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:48,232
Otherwise, you'll never be able to
get me to teach you any martial arts.

151
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:50,902
Right! I'll give it my all!

152
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,503
All righty!

153
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,405
Oh, right!

154
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:58,843
Put on those heavy-looking clothes and boots
you took off earlier and then run after him.

155
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,511
That will be more effective.

156
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,515
But putting that stuff on
makes it even harder to run!

157
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,484
Let me tell you something.

158
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:11,012
The planet that the Saiyans are from
had about the same gravity as here.

159
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,022
That's where they built up <i>their</i> bodies.

160
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,532
Do you now understand part of
the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

161
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,535
But it's more than just that.

162
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,539
Saiyans are born with
a natural fighting sense.

163
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,531
That's another thing
that makes them so formidable.

164
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,512
Hey, that's fine!
I'm a Saiyan, too!

165
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,168
Nice thrust.

166
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,636
Don't slow down your attack!

167
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:07,178
Uncle...

168
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:08,611
help me.

169
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:14,079
Don't be so needy,
you dirty brat!

170
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,926
Sure enough, he only exhibits
those dormant abilities of his

171
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,690
on the night of the full moon.

172
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,880
Yow-ow-ow-ow...

173
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,216
Looks like you at least cured
yourself of being a crybaby

174
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,877
over the last half-year, huh?

175
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:52,420
Say, Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you fought with
Father a long time ago, right?

176
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:55,819
Our fight is not yet over.

177
00:13:56,827 --> 00:14:01,321
If we're able to defeat the Saiyans,
your father's turn comes next.

178
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,835
But Father told me that
the reincarnated Piccolo-<i>san</i>

179
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:09,499
didn't seem to be the same
terribly evil person he was before.

180
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:16,674
I sort of think that, too. Mother and
Grandpa are still afraid of you, though.

181
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:21,185
Stop talking nonsense and get to sleep!

182
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,521
Tomorrow, we won't have the kind
of gentle training we did today!

183
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,613
R- right...

184
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,533
Damn him anyway...

185
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,771
<i>Since then, three weeks have</i>
<i>gone by in the blink of an eye...</i>

186
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,945
These shao-mai dumplings taste so good...

187
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,790
...that you'll say
"they taste <i>shao</i> good...

188
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,759
they taste <i>shao</i> good,"
I think you'll find.

189
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:06,793
That was great! That was great!

190
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,393
Huh? Nobody heard that one?

191
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,803
Hold it!

192
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,843
Hold it! Hold it!

193
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,846
I've got <i>gyoza</i> by the gross!

194
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,905
Hold it!

195
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,867
Now!

196
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,300
So close!

197
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:56,036
All right!

198
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,247
He's in good spirits, huh?

199
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:04,155
Hold it!

200
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:07,556
He <i>definitely</i> doesn't have
the slightest respect for me!

201
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,511
Yow-ow-ow...

202
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:32,847
He really is incredible, huh?
But I'm not giving in!

203
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:36,016
Hold up!

204
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,035
I'm so close!

205
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,172
I know!

206
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,026
All right...

207
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,435
Hold it!

208
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,053
Bubbles-<i>kun</i>, I found you!

209
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:26,190
Hold it!

210
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,537
I did it!

211
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:46,313
Wow! I finally did it!
I caught him!

212
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:57,861
<i>He's as amazing as I thought. He's already</i>
<i>overcome the gravity here, has he?</i>

213
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:03,026
<i>He might be able to handle it!</i>
<i>The Kaio-ken technique...</i>

214
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:08,702
<i>The Saiyans' assault is not far away.</i>

215
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>What kind of training will Goku</i>
<i>receive from Kaio-sama,</i>

216
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,380
<i>now that he has finally met him?</i>
