1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,960
...but Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,040
The passionate voices cheering from the
third base bleachers have not died down.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,670
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,180
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
Something seems off.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,110
That's true.
It just somehow felt
that way.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,510
It just somehow felt
that way.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,180
After all, you never know how a match
is going to turn out. They still have hope.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,450
After all, you never know how a match
is going to turn out. They still have hope.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:20,750
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,750
Right.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,340
I had absolutely no interest in the

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,060
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,220
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,460
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

16
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,660
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,430
After last year's summer tournament, he
was chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

was chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,190
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

20
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,030
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

21
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,800
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

22
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,060
What does she want?

23
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,760
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

24
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,130
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

25
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,700
You're not doing
anything today, right?

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,100
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,140
Be sure to show up.

28
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,040
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
Be sure to show up.

29
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,280
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

30
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,880
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
I didn't even say anything...

31
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,610
I didn't even say anything...

32
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,040
That was a good pitch.

33
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,550
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

34
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,350
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
What?

35
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,420
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

36
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,650
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

37
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,690
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

38
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,150
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

39
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,380
We don't know that yet.
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

40
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,630
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

41
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,700
He winds up for
the second pitch...
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

42
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,000
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,730
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...

45
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,730
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...
No, not quite.

46
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:12,830
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...

47
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,040
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...
To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

48
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,840
To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

49
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,870
And it's good!
It's a single-run home run!

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,140

It's a single-run home run!
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

52
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,240
Jyonan has gotten their eighth run!
This gives them yet another point.
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

54
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,970
Kashima is slowly rounding
third base.
Summer's almost over.

You're late, Kyon!
Show some more motivation!

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,550
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,790
I came just for you.

78
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,550
Oh, thank you.

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,460
Okay, we're all here,
so let's go.

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,360
Go where?

81
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,760
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,030
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,030
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

84
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,440
We can never get back
the time that we've lost!

85
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,770
And so we're going to do
them now, during this,

86
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,240
our one and only summer
as tenth graders.

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,250
Okay, Kyon and Koizumi,

88
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,820
we're counting on you
until we get to the pool.

89
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,350
I'd rather not ask this,
but counting on us for what?

90
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,650
We're going
on your bikes!

91
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,890
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

92
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,770
Woo hoo!

93
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,100
No diving
It's dangerous
Woo hoo!

94
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,400
No diving
It's dangerous

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,460
Restrain thyself. Canst thou
not read the "no diving" signs?

96
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,280
Hurry up and get in!
The water's warm so it feels fine!

97
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,250
In you go!

98
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,880
That looks like fun.

99
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,360
She has some rather normal ways of
enjoying her time, don't you think?

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,060
I don't think I can say that inviting
someone to do something

101
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,100
by calling them out of the blue,
and only giving a general idea

102
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,300
of what's going to happen
as "normal".

103
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,100
Well, there is the saying,
"Strike while the iron is hot."

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,140
Yeah, but when she
strikes something,

105
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,780
we've never gotten anything
but bad luck.

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,350
Even so, this is more than
peaceful enough.

107
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,040
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

108
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,780
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

109
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,220
What's wrong?

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,560
It's nothing. It's probably
just my imagination.

111
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,430
Because so much has happened
since the beginning of spring,

112
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,260
I've become
a little paranoid.

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,430
Almost! Let's go
one more time!

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,190
Delicious.
So strawberry and delicious!

115
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,400
Jeez.

116
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,410
I think it would be better to call this place
a communal pool than a public pool.

117
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,450
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

118
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,480
There it is again,
that strange sensation.

119
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,180
It feels like I've seen
this scene once before.

120
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,220
Where Nagato kind of looks
like she's bored...

121
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,790
Kyon!

122
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,160
Right, and then Haruhi
says this...

123
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,700
"These two are my
brigade members."

124
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,740
"They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!"

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,040
Okay!

126
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,050
Okay, let's have some fun!
We're going to play water soccer.

127
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,140
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,150
Well, deja vu isn't
all that uncommon.

129
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,920
I've been thinking about how we should
spend our summer vacation.

130
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,390
What do you think?

131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,230
What is this
supposed to be?

132
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,560
Summer outing, Bon festival,
part-time job, batting center...
What is this
supposed to be?

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,660
Summer outing, Bon festival,
part-time job, batting center...

134
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,030
Summer outing, Bon festival,
part-time job, batting center...
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

135
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,160
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

136
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,160
- A schedule for who?
- For us!

137
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,900
I realized that we only have two weeks
of summer vacation left.

138
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
That fact
blew me away.

139
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,500
We still have so much left to do, but
we've only got this much time left!

140
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,500
We're going to pick up
the pace!

141
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,410
All this, in just
two weeks?

142
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,570
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,210
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,620
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

145
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,950
Pardon me
for a moment.

146
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,190
Thank you.

147
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,530
We're starting tomorrow!

148
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,570
Is there a place nearby
having a Bon festival?

149
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,330
A fireworks show works, too.

150
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,740
At least try to find
this stuff out first.

151
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,540
I'll check around. I'll contact you
when I find out.

152
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,270
Okay, I'll leave it
to you, Koizumi.

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,550
All right, then,
we're done for today!

154
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,790
Nagato.

155
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,100
Umm... no, it's
nothing important.

156
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,670
How have you been?
Everything fine?

157
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,790
Fine.

158
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,070
That's good to hear.

159
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,070
Right.

160
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,210
Umm...

161
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,600
Sorry for stopping you.
You can go now.

162
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,750
What the heck?
Why did I talk to her?

163
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Koizumi was able to suddenly find a place
that was holding a Bon festival the next day.

164
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,970
Wow, so this one of this era's
summer attractions.

165
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,970
I guess it makes sense for there
to be this many people.

166
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,080
Mikuru! They have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

167
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,550
All the fish you can catch,
and all the scoops you can break!

168
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,520
You're not supposed
to break them.

169
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,460
You're interested
in that stuff?

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
- Which one?
- It's all right.

171
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,190
- This one.
- Thanks, that'll be 800 yen.

172
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:06,970
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

173
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,980
Thank you much.
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

174
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,970
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

175
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,670
so I thought it would be appropriate
for me to at least buy her that, but...

176
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,680
Wow, what a haul!

177
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,050
But I don't need so many,
so I just kept one for each of us.

178
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,450
Now then, next up
is fireworks!

179
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,350
Let's launch some fireworks
to end the day!

180
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,920
Don't you understand the
concept of getting tired?

181
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,260
Well, I guess you could say that
one of Haruhi's good points

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,060
is that she's healthy and
got a lot of stamina.

183
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,670
Jeez, she's always
so reckless!

184
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,130
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

185
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,870
That's why I wanted to forget about it, but
there was one thing lingering in my mind.

186
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,380
Tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

187
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,420
Haruhi. It's fine to
want to play around,

188
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,150
but are you finished with
your summer homework?

189
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,220
What? You can finish homework
like that in just three days.

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,450
Three days!?

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,260
You get that stuff out of the way so you can
have fun without having to worry about it.

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation.

193
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,830
Why is she
so smart?

194
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,770
It seems like the guys up in
heaven that were divvying up

195
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,670
the stats for us
were pretty unfair.

196
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,700
Everyone, we'll be
catching bugs tomorrow!

197
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,680
Whoever catches
the most bugs...

198
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,620
Okay, they'll get to be the
brigade leader for a day!

199
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,850
There's a title
I don't want at all.

200
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,050
That sounds interesting.
Are any bugs okay?

201
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,950
Hmm... only cicadas!

202
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,550
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

203
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,600
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,630
Come back here, cicada!
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

205
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,000
And so, as we expected,
or something to that effect,

206
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,970
the winner ended up
being Haruhi.

207
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,500
A catch and release attitude
is important, right?

208
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,170
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,650
If someone went back to the person that
caught them and then just let them go,

210
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,520
then I'd say they really were
about as smart as a bug.

211
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,090
There you go! Go back
to the mountains!

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,400
W-Welcome!

213
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,410
The next day, we had a part-time job that
our brigade leader had procured for us.

214
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,470
Here you are.

215
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,770
Here...

216
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,880
- Can I have one?
- Here you go.

217
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,740
Thanks!

218
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,820
Wearing a costume in heat like this isn't
a job, it's an endurance competition.

219
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,920
I said, our payment
is Mikuru's costume.

220
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,960
I've wanted this
for a while.

221
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,860
The owner said that he'd give it to us
for Mikuru's sake.

222
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
We worked, sweat pouring down
our foreheads, for that?

223
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,430
Let's hang this frog up in
the clubroom as a memento.

224
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,010
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

225
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
Damn it...

226
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,630
Hello?

227
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,230
Kyon...

228
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,100
Hello? Miss Asahina?

229
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,530
Yes, it's me...

230
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,610
Something... very not good has...

231
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,540
At this rate, I...

232
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,010
- Is this really Miss Asahina?
- Oh, hello, this is Koizumi.

233
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,480
Why are you with
Miss Asahina at this hour?

234
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,380
Certain circumstances came up.
Quite alarming ones, at that.

235
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,010
We've got an
emergency situation.

236
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Sorry to call you out
so late at night.

237
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,850
What in the world happened, Miss Asahina?
I'm going to kill you, Koizumi.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,090
Kyon...

239
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,660
I... can't go back
to the future...

240
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,240
Well... because of "classified information",
I'm always contacting the future

241
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,350
and "classified information"-ing,

242
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,520
but I hadn't received any
"classified information"

243
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,220
for about a week or so,
and I thought, "that's strange."

244
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,790
And so I
"classified information"...

245
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,760
I was so surprised, I tried
to "classified information",

246
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,790
but it was completely
"classified information".

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,070
Oh, what do I do?

248
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,670
Could it be that your
"classified information"s

249
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,140
are things that cannot
be said on television?

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,370
In other words,
this is what's going on.

251
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,850
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

252
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,410
To be precise, we've been repeating
the time from August 17th to the 31 st.

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,920
This world has lost all time
after September 1 st.

254
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,660
It's natural that Miss Asahina
cannot go back to the future.

255
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,460
The future itself
no longer exists.

256
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,000
What's natural about there being
no future? Who'd believe it?

257
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,830
We'd like for you
to believe it.

258
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,440
They say that the believers
will be saved,

259
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,110
but I've yet to be saved from
a hardship, even once.

260
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,210
So, what's the culprit?

261
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,710
You really don't know?

262
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,010
I don't want to.

263
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,150
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,650
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but I would guess that

265
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,700
somewhere inside of her is a desire
to not let summer vacation end.

266
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,820
What the heck? Do you mean she
feels regret over something?

267
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,660
That's what I believe.

268
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,500
Perhaps she feels that there's something
left that she wants to do

269
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,610
during our
summer vacation?

270
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,310
Man, the hopeless situations she causes
unfold on a galactic scale.

271
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,780
Well, with this, we've finally
been able to solve

272
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,850
the recent mysterious and frequent
feelings of deja vu.

273
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,010
You've been having them, too?
Then is it possible that other people...

274
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,620
It doesn't
seem that way.

275
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,190
It appears that the people who
are closest to Miss Suzumiya

276
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,960
are able to sense
this strangeness.

277
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,540
However, I believe that there is one person
who remembers everything,

278
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,070
more than the deja vu
that we do.

279
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,070
And who would that be?

280
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,370
I think you already know.

281
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,910
- Is that right?
- It is.

282
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,520
- You remember all of it?
- Right.

283
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,380
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

284
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,550
This is the 15,532nd time.

285
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,930
15,532?

286
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,380
Nagato, what are
you saying?

287
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,800
- Are you serious?
- I am.

288
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,710
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

289
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,480
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

290
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,390
Out of 15,532 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

291
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,360
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

292
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,630
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

293
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,460
but did not go to a goldfish
scooping stand, occurred 437 times.

294
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
We've had a part-time job
9,056 times,

295
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,370
and when we did, there were
six different kinds of jobs.

296
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,800
In addition to handing out balloons,
we also worked as movers,

297
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,070
cashiers, we handed out flyers,
call center...

298
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,010
No! That's enough...

299
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,120
This is the 15,532nd time,
that's what Nagato said.

300
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,190
Times two weeks, hmm,
that's around 595 years.

301
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,600
She alone has memories
of all that time,

302
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,460
repeating it all
over and over...

303
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,740
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that
same period of time over and over again?

304
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,510
I've heard yet another
crazy story.

305
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,490
The next day
we went stargazing.

306
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,460
The location was
Nagato's apartment.

307
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,500
Haruhi was looking through
the telescope at first, but...

308
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,930
Exactly what does she
want to do?

309
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,940
Now what could
that be?

310
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,040
If we could figure that out,
this would all be solved...

311
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,770
How about trying
this out?

312
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,380
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden
embrace from behind

313
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,350
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

314
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,080
And who would
be doing that?

315
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,620
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

316
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,280
It's my turn!
I activate The Veto.

317
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,560
All right, how about
if I do it?

318
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,030
I'm kidding. I'm lacking a certain
something for the role.

319
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,540
And all that would do is cause unnecessary
confusion in Miss Suzumiya.

320
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,550
We continued to run through a torrent
of summer vacation events.

321
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,280
We went to a real
fireworks show,

322
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,550
and we even took part in
a goby fishing tournament.

323
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,460
We also had a test of courage,
watched some movies,

324
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,970
went to the beach, went bowling,
and even sang karaoke.

325
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,900
We were always
doing something.

326
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,840
Of course, I knew that this wasn't
going to satisfy Haruhi.

327
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,910
Even so, there wasn't anything
I could do about it,

328
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,880
and the last days of our summer
vacation ticked away.

329
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,580
And so we ended up
at August 30th...

330
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,380
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

331
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,760
I wonder if this
was good enough.

332
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,030
But, hmm, well...
I guess this works.

333
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,870
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

334
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,720
That's fine, then.

335
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,420
We were able to do a lot this summer,
so that's enough, right?

336
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,720
No, it's not.
You're still not satisfied.

337
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,560
Okay, we're done
for today.

338
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,640
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

339
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,760
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

340
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,400
W-Wait, Haruhi...

341
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,370
T-There it is again! And it's
stronger than ever before!

342
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,520
It's proof that we've done all this
tens of thousands of times.

343
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,380
I can't let Haruhi leave.

344
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,150
If she goes, we'll end up repeating
these past two weeks again.

345
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,660
But what should
I do?

346
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,460
There must have been a hint
somewhere in what Haruhi said.

347
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,120
What? What?
What?

348
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,030
Remember.
You've got to remember.

349
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,760
It's something I'm worried about,
but I'm putting off...

350
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,130
If I don't do something, she'll go home.
I can't let it happen.

351
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,830
If I do, nothing
will change.

352
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,970
What have we done
up to this point?

353
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,980
What didn't we do?

354
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,050
There's no time to think. It doesn't
matter if it doesn't work,

355
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,250
just say something,
anything!

356
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,400
I still have something
I want to do!

357
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,910
That's right, homework!

358
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,310
What are you
talking about?

359
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,360
I haven't done a single bit
of my summer homework.

360
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,010
Until I do, my summer
isn't over!

361
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,550
Are you stupid
or something?

362
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,690
Koizumi!
Are you finished yet?

363
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,660
No, I'm only halfway done because
we were rushing around so much.

364
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,270
Then let's work
on it together.

365
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,600
Nagato, you come over, too.
You're still not done yet, right?

366
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,730
Miss Asahina, please come, too.

367
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,470
What? But where?

368
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,100
Let's do this
at my house.

369
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,200
Bring all of your notebooks and textbooks,
and let's do it all together.

370
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,280
We're going to finish off
all of our summer activities.

371
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,150
Nagato, Koizumi, let me copy
the stuff you've finished.

372
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,050
Right.

373
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,680
All right, we're starting
tomorrow morning.

374
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,880
We're going to do what
we can in one day!

375
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,580
Wait right there.

376
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,590
Don't you just make
a decision like that!

377
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm the leader. At times like this,
you need to ask my opinion first.

378
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,130
Kyon, acting without my permission
is against the rules!

379
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,710
I'm going too!

380
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,850
It looks like I hit
the jackpot.

381
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,610
Miss Suzumiya is a smart
and talented person.

382
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,390
She's probably always
been that way.

383
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,620
So she probably never
considered the idea

384
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,630
that summer homework
could be a burden.

385
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,530
And so she probably never had to
divide work up with her friends.

386
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,670
It was the first day of the term,
so I could have gone home,

387
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,870
but I ended up
coming here,

388
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,310
and so here I sit with Koizumi,
who showed up in the same way.

389
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,110
Frighteningly, yet importantly,
Nagato wasn't there.

390
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,690
You couldn't see it on her face,
but she might have been exhausted.

391
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,930
The idea that we experienced the latter half
of August tens of thousands of times

392
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,330
feels like it was all
made up.

393
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,530
I don't blame you
for feeling that way.

394
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,170
The "us" of here and now
don't share any memories

395
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,540
with the "us" that experienced the
sequence of the previous 15,531 times.

396
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,710
This is because the
15,532nd time around,

397
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,510
we were able to return to
the normal flow of time.

398
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,380
How about a game
of poker?

399
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,090
Sure thing. I don't have
any money, though.

400
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,750
Then we'll play
for fun.

401
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,690
But I did get
a hint.

402
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,000
That repeated deja vu.
Especially the last one,

403
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,260
it might have been sent from the
previous versions of ourselves.

404
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,340
I can be here, now,

405
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,270
thanks to the "us" that went through
those two weeks beforehand.

406
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,880
If I don't think of it
that way,

407
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,980
then it would be like me saying that all
of the summers that they went through,

408
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,210
with Haruhi treating them like they
didn't exist, were for nothing.

409
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,550
- Want any new cards?
- Nope.

410
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,250
Me either.

411
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,060
If I had the chance
to redo this day...

412
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,330
I'd like to remember to play
this hand for money.
