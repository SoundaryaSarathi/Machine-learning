1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(yeah that's worded pretty much like a cliché, edit as you want)

2
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,490
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,430
But... then why...

4
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,490
But... I think Isurugi-san is amazing.

5
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,870
Since she saw through me.

6
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,240
What does she mean, "she saw through her"?

7
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,110
Chicken feed...

8
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,000
Yo, Shinichirou!

9
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,380
Yo!

10
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,690
Tomoyo, you're being weird!

11
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,070
Today, we are stopping by Ai-chan's as well!

12
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,320
Alright, let's go then.

13
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,910
Honestly...

14
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,340
Shinichirou, lend me your English dictionary.

15
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,820
Alright, it's in my locker.

16
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,330
Then I'm taking it.

17
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,840
Wa-Wait a second, Nobuse!

18
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,240
What the hell's this?

19
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold it, Nobuse!

20
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,320
What's... wrong?

21
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,800
Well...

22
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,570
This example here is one of the basics of functions,

23
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,500
I'd hope that everyone here is able to solve these in a quick manner, so memorize them well.

24
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,380
Is it Isurugi Noe that gave you those red seeds?

25
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,360
Yeah.

26
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,550
That's what you call "love", right?

27
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,350
She's just showing how much she loves you with those red seeds!

28
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,640
I think I'm just cursed.

29
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,460
<i>You're</i> the cursed one!?{was "Is that so?"}

30
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh! The roots of the curse.

31
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,730
You go first.

32
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,410
Oh, wonderful. A date after school is it?

33
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,990
Just a few words of complaint.

34
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,320
Be careful not to get eaten up!

35
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,260
Idiot!

36
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,110
What's wrong with her? {Why is she running that fast? (Edit - What's wrong with her)}

37
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,980
Isn't that Isurugi Noe?

38
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,450
He's picking her up on a bike...

39
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,480
He's so old...

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,350
Ai-chan!

41
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,330
Huh? Where's Shinichirou?

42
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,550
Oh, he said he will come over in a moment.

43
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,740
What are you doing here?

44
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,820
These are treats for the local community school.

45
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,080
Seems to me they are really delicious! Here!

46
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
What are you doing?

47
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
Come on, it's fine!

48
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,520
Why am I depressed?

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,210
I wonder...

50
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,480
What are you two doing?

51
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,420
He's just tasting.

52
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,460
Come on.

53
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,780
Hurry up.

54
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,270
Come closer...

55
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,520
Like this?

56
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,180
Delicious.

57
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,440
I'll go get you two some drinks...

58
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,410
You know, you really do like dropped food.

59
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,370
I will eat any food fallen on the ground, as long as it's made by Ai-chan!

60
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,510
Sooner or later you'll get a stomach ache!

61
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,370
I have no regrets from that since it's Ai-chan's cooking that I ate!

62
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,660
Isurugi Noe has a boyfriend?

63
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,940
Are you serious?

64
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,210
Yeah.

65
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,280
Then why is she reaching out to you?

66
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,750
She's just using me as a replacement for Raigou-maru.

67
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,010
Raigou-maru?

68
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,350
A chicken in the school's backyard...

69
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,980
...which died.

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,660
So that means, those red seeds are...

71
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,810
Chicken feed.

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,690
That means she sees you as a chicken, huh?

73
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,630
She doesn't see me that way.

74
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,850
Shinichirou, it's time.

75
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,140
Oh crap! I've got to go home!

76
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,000
We'll take this shortcut since we're a bit late.

77
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
What's wrong?

78
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,570
How did it go? What we talked about the other day...

79
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,520
Eh?

80
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,970
You know, about Hiromi-chan.

81
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,800
Who did you hear that from?

82
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,420
I found it out myself!

83
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,080
Well...

84
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,890
She told me she wants to be a friend of Noe's.

85
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,400
But in truth, that's not the case, is it?

86
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,630
Seems so.

87
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,230
I seem to understand...

88
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,710
...the reason she said that...

89
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,440
But, I am not telling you.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,210
Hey! What's up with that?

91
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,550
You're hurting me...

92
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,920
I-I'm sorry! Well...

93
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,710
That trunk's heavy, right? Let me take care of it.

94
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,740
A person...

95
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,520
One person can only get close to another person when she's in love with him, right?

96
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,540
What if, you want to get close to that person, but at the same time, that couldn't happen?

97
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,670
Since someone's already beside him...

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,150
Who are you talking about?

99
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,010
It must be a pain in the butt for the girls that fall in love with you.

100
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,430
Ow- Ow- Oww!

101
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,610
For example, if Hiromi fell in love with someone,

102
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,200
and close to that person is Noe...

103
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,750
Who would that be?

104
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,970
Let's see... Boys around Noe...

105
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,000
Could it be me?

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,140
Like that could happen.

107
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,230
But... there's no one else!

108
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,110
Is that how it is?

109
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,090
Wait, that can't be it.

110
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,960
But, perhaps...

111
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,710
Good evening!

112
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,730
Kid, lower your waist!

113
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,120
Understood!

114
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,010
Welcome back, bocchan!{Rou-chan.} {Possible note: "Bocchan" is a way of referring to the young master of a household}

115
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,410
I'm home!

116
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,000
Huh?

117
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,510
What?

118
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
Seems like you're quite happy.

119
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,170
Oh... err... it's actually facial exercises.

120
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,320
I heard it improves your health by shifting it to the sides.

121
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,480
Facial exercises...

122
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,460
Facial exercises, huh? Oww!

123
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm counting on you.

124
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,600
I need you to deliver this.

125
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,190
But you continue to behave rudely.

126
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,110
You understand, right?

127
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm home.

128
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,370
Welcome back.

129
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,330
Take care of it, okay?

130
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,210
Going somewhere?

131
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,270
It's urgent.

132
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,110
This is the sake for Amimoto-ojisan's celebration.

133
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
It's late already! We could deliver that tomorrow!

134
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,630
We promised that we would deliver it by today.

135
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,870
Then, I will...

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,270
Shinichirou!

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,220
Let's go.

138
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,890
Is something wrong?

139
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,350
Why did the two of them go out?

140
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,540
They're taking something over to Oji-san's.

141
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,180
Shin-chan doesn't have to go too...

142
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,770
Well, I think it's fine to let Shinichirou handle that.

143
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,480
Why must Shin-chan--

144
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,330
Why must Hiromi do it?

145
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,970
Hiromi's now a child of our household,

146
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,590
Just like Shinichirou.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,750
She's not my kid!

148
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,790
Hey!

149
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,050
You didn't have to come with me...

150
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,040
This street is dark and dangerous.

151
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Besides, the bottle is heavy.

152
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,060
You don't need to worry about it too much,

153
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,430
Since you're not a maid.

154
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,200
Right now, I am under the care of your family...

155
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,750
Oh yeah, we once walked this street, right?

156
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,130
Remember? You got lost on the day of the festival,

157
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,280
And you cried a lot!

158
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,220
I don't remember...

159
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
Is that so...

160
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,200
Hey, by the way, what did you mean yesterday with "Noe seeing through you"?

161
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,220
Thank you.

162
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,440
Actually, it's really scary to walk this street.

163
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,650
I-I see! I guess you're right! {(Edit - I see, You're right)}

164
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,520
Don't leave me alone...

165
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,010
Don't leave me alone, Shinichirou-kun...

166
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,440
It was all sealed...{At the moment that I've decided to live in this family,}

167
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,470
When it was decided I was to live in this house.

168
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,830
"Don't leave me alone", huh?

169
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,280
What a shock that she doesn't remember...

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,850
After all, it was one step forward for us to walk together in the streets.

171
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Wanting to hold your hand, I extended mine.

172
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,330
At that moment, snow started to fall.

173
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,250
It was red... red.

174
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,590
Mysterious snow.

175
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,430
COLD!

176
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,460
Good morning.

177
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,480
Is it already that late?

178
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Nope, nope.

179
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm just going to prepare for the basketball competitions.

180
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,100
Bye.

181
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,230
Err...

182
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,870
Well, err... when the time comes, I'll go cheer for you.

183
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,880
Good morning.

184
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,270
I'm going back to sleep for a little longer.

185
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,770
Is that Hotarugawa's basketball team?

186
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,560
What are you planning to do?

187
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,400
Well, since I have nothing else to do, I'll go take a look.

188
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,980
Hey, Nakagami-kun.

189
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,940
What are those?

190
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,720
That's yours, right?

191
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,930
Huh, what?

192
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,280
Ohh! These are...

193
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,840
What's-

194
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,370
That's fantastic! It's connected together!

195
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,060
T-H-A-T G-I-R-L...!

196
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,610
Good luck with that!

197
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,040
What is she thinking?!

198
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,990
What are these?

199
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,420
Who knows?

200
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,090
Isurugi Noe!

201
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,270
I told you, I don't want the red seeds!

202
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,990
That's not your choice to make.

203
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,250
You know, I don't have a clue what you want, but...

204
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,500
Wouldn't it be better if you didn't get too involved with me?

205
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,340
You have a boyfriend, right?

206
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,930
I saw you together with him!

207
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,370
Therefore... Stop doing this!{That's why, know your place! ( shouldn't it be "That's why, stop doing this!" Miku-chan) (Edit - Miku-chan is correct)}

208
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,240
Wait! I can't get down!

209
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,520
You climbed up yourself, get down by yourself.

210
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,010
Hey!

211
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,440
Oww...

212
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,720
Come on...

213
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,310
Come on, stand up.{Come on, back on your feet.}

214
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,990
What are you doing?!

215
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,130
Soon, there'll be a cockroach...

216
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,410
Soon, there'll be a cockroach on top of Shinichirou's head...

217
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:15,470
On Shinichirou's back there's a cockroach too...

218
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,870
You're... light.

219
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,270
That way!

220
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,670
You know what's over there?

221
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,120
That way!

222
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,790
Does your leg really hurt?

223
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,610
That guy is...

224
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,860
It's fine here.

225
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,020
Hey, your leg... What the hell?!

226
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,960
Dude, what the hell were you doing?

227
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,190
That's the one.

228
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,620
No. 4.

229
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,870
That guy's Noe's...

230
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,990
Onii-chan!

231
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,370
Onii-chan...

232
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,490
Huh?

233
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,890
Wait, her brother?!

234
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,610
Go for it!

235
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Hoo-hoo... So you mistook her brother for her boyfriend! {I think "hoo hoo" could be translated to "I see", but this way it's a bit more obvious he's taunting him}

236
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,850
Well, not like it's unusual.

237
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,000
Right...

238
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,130
At least confirm it first next time!

239
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,600
It's not that big of a deal. Not like I care if she has a boyfriend or not.

240
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,730
That's true, but seems to me that this is one less trouble for you.

241
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,280
Don't say stupid things!{You bastard! ( or "Don't be Stupid" Miku-chan) (Edit - Miku-chan is correct)}

242
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,000
That's true...

243
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,730
Since you have Yuasa Hiromi in your hands.

244
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,490
Don't just decide on your own!

245
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,890
You better think of a reason real quick.

246
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
What do you mean?

247
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,820
Just now, when you were carrying Noe, she got a good look at you.

248
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,620
That will most likely end up as a misunderstanding.

249
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,940
Why must I find a reason?

250
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,570
Leave first.

251
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,770
Excuse me, can you pass me the ball?

252
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,050
Right away!

253
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,140
Did you see that just now?

254
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,240
What is that idiot thinking?

255
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,190
It's fine with me.

256
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Really?

257
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,960
Hey, is that really fine with you?

258
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,080
Come on, Hiromi, seriously, don't you like Nakagami-kun?

259
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,960
Isurugi Noe's leg is hurt...

260
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,130
Nothing has happened between us...

261
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,630
She suddenly fell down from the tree...

262
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,290
What's this? Somehow I'm feeling like I was the one at fault here!

263
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Screw this!

264
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Screw this! Screw this! Screw this! Screw this!

265
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,580
You liar!

266
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,570
It's true.

267
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,430
I wouldn't lie to Tomoyo about that.

268
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,580
The person I like is Hotarugawa's No. 4.

269
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,160
Is that true?

270
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,160
I thought...

271
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,460
So, please don't mention Shinichirou-kun's name again.

272
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,910
You like chatting that much...

273
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,380
Um, could it be you're hiding from me?

274
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,730
Go out with Noe.

275
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,720
Hey, blink your eyes.
