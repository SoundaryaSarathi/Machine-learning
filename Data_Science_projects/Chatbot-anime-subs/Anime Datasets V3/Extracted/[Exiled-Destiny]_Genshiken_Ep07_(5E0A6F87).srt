00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:33,954
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:38,824
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:42,404
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:45,174
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:52,214

00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:58,344
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:03,844

The weather's sure nice now.

18
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,024
That it is.

19
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,754
Hey, is this a good way
to get to building 7?

20
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,854
I think it probably is...

21
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,534
New freshmen are here already.

22
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,264
That they are.

24
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,004
I wonder if Genshiken
will get new members.

25
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,844
I hope not.

26
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:02,344
If Genshiken gets more active,
it'll be harder for Kohsaka to quit.

27
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:04,754
Hi hi!

28
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,044
Sup.

29
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,084
Oh, Saki! Saki!

30
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,054
Huh?

31
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:12,684
Why don't we cosplay together
for the freshman activities fair?

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,724
Absolutely not!

33
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:18,364
When on earth are you going to
cosplay?

34
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:21,304
H-Hold on, you think
it's a matter of time?

35
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,724
It isn't?

36
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,034
No, it's not, at all!

37
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:27,734
Now, now.

38
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:32,074
We've talked about basing
our recruitment on cosplay...

39
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:35,784
...but isn't that too restrictive within the
scope of Genshiken activities?

40
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,754
That is, it's just two of us...

41
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,954
We're pretty much the world of hobbies.

42
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,754
Our members c-can do just
about anything they want...

43
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:48,454
...but m-maybe it's too
intense for the fair.

44
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,604
So yeah, that's the general feeling.

45
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,764
But I want to do it every chance I get!

46
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:58,004
Uh, yeah...

47
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,664
Your personality sure changes
when it comes to cosplay...

48
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,344
It does?

49
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,604
Don't look at me if any weirdos show
up.

50
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,114
I'd say it's a little late
to worry about that now.

51
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,414
Because there's already
plenty of them here?

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,624
So, aren't you going to start the number
umpteen-hundred meeting thing?

53
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,054
Why wait?

54
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:21,134
Huh, so that's your disposition.

55
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,804
The original story goes
into a second part...

56
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,894
...new characters are introduced
and it causes lots of commotion.

57
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,494
And they get through okay.

58
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:42,184
A-At this point it's
n-nostalgic to see Alex.

59
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,744
There's some nice added scenes
for it being a recap episode.

60
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,414
Good stuff.

61
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:59,404
How can you watch this
over and over so much?

62
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:00,154
Huh?

63
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,564
Is it interesting?

64
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,664
Uh, you can't really
simplify it that much...

65
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:09,174
We watch it because it's interesting to
see whether it's interesting or not...

66
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,544
You're no fun, girl.

67
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:17,554
Miss President...

68
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:21,414
Our chairman!

69
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,054
Did he graduate?
Did he leave the school?

70
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:26,684
Um, the chairman?

71
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:27,994
No, I don't know...

72
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,624
She's right, w-where is he?

73
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:31,424
Who knows?

74
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:34,794
Did he find a job? Is he going to
graduate? Is he repeating a year?

75
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,864
Wait, what year was he in to begin with?

76
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:38,794
I'm still here.

77
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:41,974
You needn't be so startled.

78
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:44,044
You always startle me.

79
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,714
Because of a guilty conscience?

80
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,204
Not in the least!

81
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,554
That means you can rest at ease.

82
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,884
I have an announcement to make.

83
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:56,684
What?

84
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,684
I think I'll retire as chairman.

85
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:07,104
That's a very sudden
and weighty announcement.

86
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,734
I figured I would get
around to graduating.

87
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:12,034
"Get around to?" After how long?

88
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:15,274
T-Then he hasn't
thought about it until n-now?

89
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:19,114
I plan to spend all year
writing my graduation thesis.

90
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,474
I've gathered plenty of data.

91
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,954
What data?

92
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:27,254
Therefore I'd like to recommend
Madarame as the next chairman.

93
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,124
What, me?

94
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,724
Oh, good idea.

95
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:35,094
It essentially already
feels that way anyway.

96
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,204
A-And the only other
senior is Haraguchi...

97
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,534
Don't worry.

98
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,774
I myself left all the
practicalities to Tanaka anyway.

99
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:49,244
Oh... then maybe we should
offer it to Tanaka first...

100
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:52,014
Just do it. You're qualified.

101
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:56,314
Yeah? Okay then...

102
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:58,984
I'll give it a go...

103
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,714
Congratulations, you're
our second chairman.

104
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:03,994
The second?

105
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:04,614
<i>That's all?
The second?</i>

106
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,594
He's gone!

107
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:14,194

108
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:33,984
All right, then.

<i>Suioh University</i>

110
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,894
What? Two people joined?

111
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,074
They're still just provisional.

112
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,274
I haven't even met them.

113
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:53,644
Even a club like this
gets new members...

114
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:56,264
I wonder what they're like.

115
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:07,954
Oh.

116
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,314
"Oh" what?

117
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,024
Oh, right now...

118
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,184
What?

119
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,664
Uh, ah...

120
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,294
Ahh, so much for the surprise test...

121
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,104
Hey, new guys.

122
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:21,034
Um...

123
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:22,294
Hi there...

124
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:31,204
...how about introducing yourselves?

125
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:33,074
I'm Sawazaki.

126
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:35,244
My name is Kuchiki.

127
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,344
Please call me Coochy.

128
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,144
Not on your life!

129
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,024
Now, now.

130
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,154
As for me...

131
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:46,424
Oh forget it, whatever.

132
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:48,624
Come on now, Kasukabe.

133
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,864
You know, I guess I just
don't have an "otaku name."

134
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,394
I'm sorry, she's a mundane.

135
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,064
Oh, then she doesn't
cosplay or anything.

136
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:01,434
Cosplay? You mean Ohno?

137
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:03,904
Did her cosplay dazzle you?

138
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,244
Kasukabe...

139
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,174
N-No, it meant nothing!

140
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:13,014
Don't get carried away, Kasukabe.

141
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,814
These guys are still new.

142
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,954
I realize that of course, Mr. Chairman!

143
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:22,254
But you know, you two
should forget this club.

144
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,764
This room is actually haunted.

145
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:27,734
Huh?

146
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:31,434
By the ghost of the first
chairman who died five years ago...

147
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:33,844
Cut that out!

148
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:36,104
The original chairman's still alive!

149
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,804
Don't act like he's dead!

150
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:39,104
It's not a lie, though!

151
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,944
I've kept quiet until now,
but sometimes I see it.

152
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:47,484
A dog-like face wearing glasses
floats by gaps in the bookshelves.

153
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,914
You can say that with a straight face?

154
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,724
Don't turn around, you two.

155
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:56,794
Huh?

156
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,294
There's a face in the
shelf behind you...

157
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:02,134
<i>Note: It's just an image.</i>

158
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,004
Hey, that's enough of that!

159
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:06,794
Not bad, Saki.

160
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,244
Oh right, it really was made up.

161
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,044
Maybe.

162
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:17,044
Kasukabe's started messing with
the newcomers right on schedule...

163
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:19,784
I have to put an end to
this no matter what...

164
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,984
Yes, as the chairman!

171
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:46,174
Then...

172
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:49,084
Nah, I was wondering if
we were going to chug.

173
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,514
No, we don't.

174
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:53,154
Well that's a downer.

175
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:56,814
It's not a downer, it's
just how we do things.

176
00:09:58,394 --> 00:09:59,454
Excuse me!

177
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,824
What'll ya have?

178
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,194

cheese wontons, and then...

181
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:11,804
Uh, hey...

182
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:14,004
Oh, you want to order?

183
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,344
How about an assorted platter?

184
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:19,044
Well hey, it's a welcome party.

185
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:22,484
O-Okay, fried chicken, and...

186
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:24,214
Noooo!

187
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,114
No chicken for me!

188
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,454
I oppose the fried chicken!

189
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:33,084
T-Then, c-cancel
the chicken.

190
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:35,124
Sure, with pleasure.

191
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,254
Instead, a
p-pickled e-eggplant.

192
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:41,124
Yeees!

193
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,234
That's outfit's a Cecil, isn't it?

194
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,344
It's no surprise it looks good on you.

195
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,884
What do you mean, "no surprise?"

196
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,974
Not many people can dress well.

197
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:00,954
If we knew other, that'd be one thing...

198
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:03,424
But I'm the type who thinks a
guy complimenting my clothes...

199
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,954
...right off the bat is up to no good.

200
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,034
But that's not true.

201
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,194
Don't waste your time.

202
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,134
What?

203
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:14,054
I'm just here to keep an eye on
Kohsaka.

204
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,464
Oh, is that so?

205
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,034
It doesn't look that way at all.

206
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,434
What do you mean by that?

207
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:25,074
Ah, well, I guess you
just look like friends.

208
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,444
That's none of your business.

209
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,454
I'm sorry, it was just a question.

210
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,424
You should know that...

211
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,284
...even if this is a welcome party,
I don't feel like welcoming anyone.

212
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,294
Oh come on.

213
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:40,954
Let's enjoy ourselves.

214
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,224
Ohno.

215
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,924
What'll you have next?

216
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:48,404
Um, um, another one of these.

217
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:49,974
Excuse me!

218
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,094
You got it!

219
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:55,634
Which will it be, as God in heaven says.

220
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,304
Hey.

221
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,274
Start a conversation.

222
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:03,284
Aren't y-you
the ch-chairman?

223
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,144
Kuchiki?

224
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:11,324
W-What made you decide to join us?

225
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:12,954
You see...

226
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,494
Probably Ohno and her cosplay.

227
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,964
Leave well alone with a ten-foot pole!

228
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:22,164
Not just that, or
rather what besides that?

229
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,234
Let's see...

230
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:28,234
I've embraced a strong
and profound interest in...

231
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,004
...anime, comics, and the
like since I was little.

232
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,014
Hey, what'll you have next?

233
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:36,014
O-Okay, a cassis orange.

234
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,484
Excuse me!

235
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:38,554
Coming up!

236
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,614
So I decided to take this
chance on entering college to...

237
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:46,594
Here's your spring vegetable
pizza and tasty potato croquettes.

238
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,214
All right.

239
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:49,124
Those are mine, mine, mine!

240
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,094
He's hogging them?

241
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,034
Delicious!

242
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,744
I guess he's come out of his shell.

243
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,204
You don't drink?

244
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,934
That's not it.

245
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,054
Beer might as well be water.

246
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,054
I've been drinking it since high school.

247
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:20,224
I really don't like how otaku-ish the
manga and anime clubs are.

248
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,624
We have our share of otaku too.

249
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,734
But you have girl members.

250
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:27,464
That alone makes you
completely different.

251
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:32,074
Just between us, I also
scoped out the Manga Club.

252
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,104
What a waste.

253
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:37,234
It's almost all lardass pigs.

254
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,404
I wouldn't know...

255
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:44,584
Anime is Japan's culture these days.

256
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,254
Simply enjoying it is stupid.

257
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:52,754
Being able to study it more as culture
this way, it's like, when a culture's...

258
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,364
Uhh...

259
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,454
Um, a subculture?

260
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,224
Yes! That's it, a subculture!

261
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,274
Right...

262
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:02,364
Did you know?

263
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,204
These days anime films are
invited to be shown at Cannes...

264
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:09,564
...and figures are auctioned
as art by Sotheby's.

265
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,304
No, I didn't know that.

266
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,274
This much is to be expected.

267
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:16,614
Hey, what's that? What's that?

268
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,744
It's a cassis orange.

269
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,284
Cassis orange?

270
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:21,284
Yes.

271
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:22,684
Let me try a quick sip.

272
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:27,484
I like!

273
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,284
Excuse me, Miss!

274
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,464
Coming up!

275
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:32,664
A cassis orange, cassis orange!

276
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,124
Gladly!

277
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,704
Want me to finish that?

278
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,444
No, that's okay.

279
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,444
Here's your cassis orange.

280
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,474
Excuse me.

281
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:44,604
What can I get you?

282
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,644
A double sweet-potato
shochu, on the rocks.

283
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,114
You got it!

284
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,684
Excuse me, could I get some shochu
too?

285
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:52,814
You got it!

286
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,484
There's been a shochu boom lately.

287
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,424
They say good shochu
is better than sake.

288
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,824
Is that so?

289
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:03,294
Aha, I might not look it
but I keep up with fashion.

290
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,494
Let's go find some good
shochu to drink sometime.

291
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:07,294
I'll scope out a good place.

292
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:08,564
Right...

293
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,604
I've got to go to the bathroom...

294
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:19,734
A drinking party?

295
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:20,644
That's a rarity.

296
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,584
Ahh right, it's the welcome party.

297
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,384
More or less.

298
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:25,744
How many joined?

299
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,854
Two, but they're provisional.

300
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,424
That's not very many.
Is Genshiken doing okay?

301
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:34,224
The Manga Club reserved a
private room, but it's still full.

302
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,694
We're just swelling with members.

303
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,154
Right...

304
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:38,694
I heard the news.

305
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:40,834
You're the chairman now?

306
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,734
Well, so it seems...

307
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,664
Well, even if I got passed over...

308
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,104
...I'm pretty busy, so I don't
think I could've done it anyway...

309
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,504
...but it would've been nice
to at least be told about it.

310
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,874
Sorry about that.

311
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,744
In a way, I aim to be a
guardian for Genshiken.

312
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:01,314
So, if you have any
problems just tell me.

313
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,224
I'll help you out.

314
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:13,864
Ohno.

315
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:15,874
Are you all right?

316
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:17,704
It's good!

317
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,534
Want some, Saki?

318
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,844
No thanks.

319
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:26,744
How much can she drink?

320
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,614
Don't you think guys
who let themselves go...

321
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:32,184
...because they're
otaku are the ugliest?

322
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,684
It doesn't really mean
they've let themselves go...

323
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,224
How d'you figure?

324
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,894
Y'know what...

325
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:40,714
A-Are you okay?

326
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,384
I'll go with him.

327
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,464
Huh, why you?

328
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,894
Sasahara can do it.

329
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:55,874
Have a drink, Saki.

330
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,674
I said no thanks.

331
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,474
Aren't you drinking too much?

332
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:01,774
Are you worried about me?

333
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,514
I love you, Saki.

334
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:05,984
Yes, of course.

335
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,914
I'm happy we can drink together.

336
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:13,394
I'm not drinking, you're
the only one who is.

337
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,694
Then you should drink some too.

338
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,734
Not the shochu.

339
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,794
But beer, that I can do.

340
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,734
I love you, Saki!

341
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:25,974
Come on, let's go.

342
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:27,434
Don't forget anything.

343
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,914
Two hearts in balance.

344
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:33,404
Kujibiki unbalance.

345
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:37,284
Love, dreams, yearning...

346
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,314
Hey, are you all right?
Want me to bring some water?

347
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:43,424
I'm all good, no problem!

348
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,524
Come on, Saki. Drink, drink.

349
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,494
Yes, yes, I'm drinking.

350
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,494
Drink more!

351
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,594
Give me a break!

352
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:54,894
Coochy! Shut up!

353
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:58,774
Sir, this is your last
chance to order anything.

354
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,234
Would you care to?

355
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,434
Saki!

356
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:02,664
Are you sure you're all right?

357
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,004
I'm fine.

358
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:05,874
I think we've had enough.

359
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,244
You got it.

360
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:09,504
Tanaka, w-we're leaving.

361
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,974
Sawazaki, you look pretty bad!

362
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:17,694
I'm takin' a dump!

363
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,854
Thank you so much!

364
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,294
You okay?

365
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,964
You still don't look good.

366
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,054
Nah, I'm fine now!

367
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,624
What now? Call it a night?

368
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,404
Let's go to the next place! Okay?

369
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:33,764
But...

370
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,704
I want us to be together more!

371
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,574
But there's nowhere open this late.

372
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:40,484
Then come to my place.

373
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:41,414
What?

374
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,904
There's plenty of sitting room.

375
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:45,884
Thanks for having us.

376
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,474
Thanks for nothing.

377
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,894
Hey, new guy, this is not your room.

378
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:58,894
It's all good, we're in
the same club and all.

379
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,064
You're still just provisional.

380
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,394
Oh, I like it well
enough, I think I'll join.

381
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,074
Then let's have a test.

382
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:11,634
An admission test.

383
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,754
If you beat Kohsaka in a
fighting game or whatever...

384
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:16,854
...we'll approve you joining the club.

385
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,574
That sounds good.
I'm pretty into fighting games.

386
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,384
Splendid.

387
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,484
Want to give it a shot?

388
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,024
Okay, I'll do it.

389
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,394
Don't do it, man, seriously.

390
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:28,894
Let's do this.

391
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,094
I'll go easy since
it's a friendly match.

392
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:35,064
Don't go easy, just play
the way you always do.

393
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,064
But...

394
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:39,494
The way you always do,
like that Puyo Pop time.

395
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,504
Right...

396
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,864
Guilty Gear Isuka, huh?

397
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,444
That just came out.

398
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:47,614
Have you played a lot in arcades?

399
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,944
Here and there.

400
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:53,684
I'll show them the difference
between a poser and the real thing!

401
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:59,954
<i>Jam Kuradoberi make her entrance!</i>

402
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:09,094
A throw chained into an air combo!?

403
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,434
Which one are you?

404
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,024
The guy.

405
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,874
Damn, he's reading my Roman Cancel!

406
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,174
Whoa, a Dust into a D-loop?

407
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,774
Did Kohsaka win?

408
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,794
It's a one-match game,
so why not try again?

409
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:39,094
Son of a bitch!

410
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:44,764
Did he win?

411
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,704
Yes, yes, he won.

412
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:52,004
I guess it makes you happy when
your boyfriend wins at games?

413
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:53,974
I suppose so.

414
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,104
You're not too bad.

415
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,984
You'd say that after
perfect-ing me twice?

416
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,114
Don't forget, you've
been drinking tonight.

417
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,624
You're absolutely right!

418
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:06,884
You didn't drink at
all, and I drank a lot!

419
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:08,994
Of course you'd play better than me.

420
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:09,964
Want to play again?

421
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:10,894
You're on.

422
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:12,194
All right!

423
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:13,054
What?

424
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:14,864
I'm going to cheer for him.

425
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,064
Kick his butt, Kohsaka!

426
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,074
Come on, Kasukabe!
Not in front of everyone!

427
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,904
If you win the next one, I'll kiss you.

428
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:21,804
Hey!

429
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,004
Are you sure that's cool?

430
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,874
What's your problem?
You don't have to shout.

431
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:29,214
This has nothing to do with the test!

432
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:31,984
Oh, the test, you're right.

433
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:38,024
Then, if he beats Kohsaka,
I'll even kiss the new guy.

434
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:40,724
There she goes again.

435
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,904
<i>Suioh University</i>

436
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,004
Hey, where's your next lecture?

437
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,054
What's wrong?

438
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:09,984
I could've sworn that was...

439
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:15,254
Do you remember?

440
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:18,734
Our childhood...

441
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:26,234
Where, where?

442
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:28,064
<i>Genshiken</i>

443
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:31,844
Are you alright?

444
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:32,574
Yeah...

445
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,944
You don't have one, Kohsaka?

446
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:35,944
Not at all.

447
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,874
I've got it.

448
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:38,784
What?

449
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:43,254
If we do the Kohsaka test every
year, I can smash Genshiken.

450
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:45,254
Right, Mr. Chairman?

451
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:15,914
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

452
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:25,224
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

453
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:34,664
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

454
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:44,244
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

455
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:54,814
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

456
00:23:55,894 --> 00:24:06,134
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

457
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:15,744
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

458
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:25,724
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

459
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:34,424
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

460
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:43,744
Sasahara, you don't go for
the "little sister" image.

461
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:46,404
Yeah, I guess I would have to
pick the "childhood friend" image.

462
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:47,914
What about maids?

463
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:48,714
<i>Good stuff!
What about maids?</i>

464
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:52,254
I might not have brought it up before,
but I like girls with cat ears too.

465
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:54,114
I think bandaged girls are what I dig.

466
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,794
How about a girl who's class president?

467
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,254
<i>A- Ok!
How about a girl who's class president?</i>

468
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:59,124
I wonder if there are any characters
like that in games or anime.

469
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,054
A childhood friend cat-eared maid...

470
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,464
...who's class president at
school, is usually stern...

471
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:06,724
...but who's also clumsy, covered
in bandages, and the main character!

472
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,094
That's so awesome!
