1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:03,812
The next time I fall in love,

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,522
I'd prefer a guy who's
a bit coldhearted.

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:12,422
He doesn't hafta listen
to my selfish desires.

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:16,602
However, on the day
after we have a quarrel,

5
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:20,302
he'll give me a single flower
and a couple words of love.

6
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:22,602
That kinda guy.

7
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:48,932
When I was darkness at that time

8
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:51,772
With trembling lips

9
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:54,862
In a corner of a room I cry

10
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,952
The more I struggle

11
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,782
The more this wound deepens

12
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,942
The broken promise hurt me

13
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:10,682
Nobody can save me

14
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,862
God, I have only one request

15
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:17,492
Stop tearing apart my love

16
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:20,832
I need your love

17
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:24,062
I'm a broken rose

18
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:27,012
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

19
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:29,172
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

20
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,942
I need your love

21
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:35,252
I'm a broken rose

22
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:38,182
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

23
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:42,142
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

24
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,122
I wanna need your love

25
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:48,352
I'm a broken rose

26
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:50,692
I wanna need your love

27
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,152
I'm so excited I can't sleep.

28
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:29,292
It seems like such a long time ago
that we went to the Trapnest concert.

29
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:38,502
Damn! I kept looking at Ren,
and forgot to look at Takumi.

30
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,352
Takumi...

31
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,812
Oh, well. What's done is done.

32
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,352
It's been at least two hours
since Nana left.

33
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,222
But knowing Nana...

34
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,062
One day we'll be better than Trapnest!
Good riddance!

35
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:01,362
Let me see you try.

36
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:09,502
I was thinking, what if she bluntly declares
a rivalry and quickly returned home?

37
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:12,712
But I'm sure things are going well.

38
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,842
I hope things go well.

39
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:19,052
Since we came into this world
as women,

40
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:22,492
let's be happy as women, Nana.

41
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:37,902
Nana!

42
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,242
I have no intention of getting back
together with you!

43
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:30,982
What are you doing?
These roses must've been expensive.

44
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:34,652
What's with the stingy comments?
You're Trapnest's guitarist.

45
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,462
Flowers wither after
a little time anyway,

46
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:40,692
so I'm making good use of them
while they still have value.

47
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,102
Not a story I prefer.

48
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,662
But you won't wither, Ren!

49
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,342
In any case, look at this gorgeous room.

50
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:54,972
And you each get a room to yourself?

51
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,602
This is what they call
a"Suite Room," right?

52
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,512
Nope. "Deluxe Room."

53
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,912
It's deluxe, all right.
Especially this bath.

54
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:07,822
It's unnecessarily too big.
I don't feel comfortable.

55
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:13,302
Being here like this is like
going back in time.

56
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:16,472
We used to soak in the bathtub
every day like this

57
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,402
and talk about all kinds of stuff.

58
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:23,702
The bathroom in our room was small
but it was comfortable and I liked it.

59
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,112
Say, Ren, what are we gonna do
about that room?

60
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:30,542
Nobody's living there, so it's a waste.
You should move out.

61
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:34,282
It's okay. That was my starting point.

62
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:37,152
One day, I'll purchase it,
return in my old age,

63
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,782
and quietly live there together
with you.

64
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,652
Don't make decisions for me about
when I get old.

65
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:47,792
When I was a kid that building
was used for storage.

66
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:51,472
I would run away from that
shitty orphanage and go hide there.

67
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:55,262
I found a guitar and made it my own,
and I would play it there all night.

68
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:59,342
Regardless whether you were born
with talent or not,

69
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,972
anyone could play well after
that much practice.

70
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:06,722
This is the first time you told me that.

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:11,512
I never told anyone. I wanted people
to think I was gifted.

72
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:24,362
You don't hafta wash me.
I took a bath just before I came here.

73
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,872
Old habits die hard.
But why are you so embarrassed?

74
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,602
I'm not embarrassed!

75
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:31,842
Like I've said many times,

76
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,112
I'm no longer on the pill,
so we're not gonna do it in the bath.

77
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,682
I know, I know.

78
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:36,712
Do you, really?

79
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,822
Ren...

80
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:49,862
Hm?

81
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:52,492
That thing you said earlier. Is it true?

82
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,422
Which one?

83
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:58,232
Right now, I'm not about to
give up my pride

84
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,742
so I can't live with you like we used to.

85
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:07,942
But it would be nice if we could maybe
meet like this from time to time.

86
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:12,182
Hold each other and talk
about each other.

87
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:16,582
And one day when we're much older,

88
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:20,292
when I no longer care about
pride and recognition,

89
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,932
when I've grown tired of singing...

90
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,892
Then can I return to that home too?

91
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,762
That night I had a dream.

92
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,272
I don't remember what I dreamt,

93
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:43,812
but in that dream I was wrapped
in feelings of warmth and happiness.

94
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:52,352
I woke up past noon and
found Nana there sleeping next to me.

95
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,322
I wonder if it would be okay
to ask her.

96
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:00,292
I'm sure it would be okay.

97
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:03,532
She did say she'd talk to me about
anything if I ask.

98
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,272
Hey, Nana.

99
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,072
How'd it go with Ren?

100
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,542
I can't answer anything you ask...

101
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,772
Huh? What? I don't understand.

102
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,252
What I said was,

103
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,772
I can't answer anything you ask
while I'm brushing my teeth!

104
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,352
Really, you're not too good
at figuring things out, Hachiko.

105
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,452
Well, I shouldn't expect much.
You're a dog, after all.

106
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,922
Come on, Nana.

107
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:30,492
Thanks for the meal.

108
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,892
There's more miso soup, so just ask.

109
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:33,922
Yes.

110
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,332
She never did answer my question.

111
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:37,802
Liar!

112
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:40,472
And to think I was rooting
for you so much

113
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:41,902
that I forgot to look at
Takumi in person.

114
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,002
If I knew what was coming,
I would've only looked at Takumi.

115
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:47,442
Takumi!

116
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,502
Say, Hachiko...

117
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,482
I trust you,
so I have a favor to ask.

118
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:53,952
You trust me?

119
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,252
Sure. What can I do for you?

120
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,922
If you do your job well,
I'll give you a treat.

121
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,662
You did take good care of me with
this latest event, after all.

122
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:05,992
What would you like? Beef jerky?

123
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,422
Takumi's autograph!

124
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,692
Consider it done.

125
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,602
I will ask Ren for it.

126
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,672
All right!

127
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,272
Does a simple autograph
please you that much?

128
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,902
It's not that! You and Ren are
back together, aren't you?!

129
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:23,242
W-Well, I wouldn't exactly... ah...

130
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:26,942
So what I'm asking, since
we don't have a phone in our place...

131
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:29,852
Well, I do plan to buy a cell phone soon.

132
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,162
But in the meantime,
should he need to,

133
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,522
I was hoping Ren could call you
on your cell...

134
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:37,152
So you want me to take Ren's call
and relay his messages to you, right Nana?

135
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:38,502
That's right.

136
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,932
I'll gladly do it.

137
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:44,902
Here's Ren's cell phone e-mail address,
so could you send him your address?

138
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,402
That's great news, Nana.

139
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,572
It's not!

140
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,562
Why not?

141
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:53,642
Why does it hafta end up like this?
This isn't what I intended.

142
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,172
I went to wrap things up with him.

143
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,952
My intentions were to put
an end to it all.

144
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,442
Why did I get carried away?

145
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:03,912
That's so lame.

146
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:08,252
She said that while blushing
and curling up.

147
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,122
I had never seen her look so cute.

148
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:17,932
Geez... major adrenaline rush...

149
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:21,072
I want happiness
as soon as possible too.

150
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,642
Or rather, a boyfriend.

151
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,402
Then we'll organize a party.

152
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,672
Not that way. I want a love
that's meant to be.

153
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,412
Oh, but now that you mention it,
a party might be good, too.

154
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,582
What the hell happened over there?

155
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,082
Don't ask me.
I'm on a top secret mission.

156
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:39,252
Top secret? Finding a boyfriend?

157
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:42,682
But meeting someone at a party could
also be a love meant to be.

158
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,662
You don't hafta do that.

159
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:46,862
You've got plenty blooming lately
right in your own garden.

160
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:47,832
Garden?

161
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:50,732
Good point. Take the band members
of your roommate's band, for instance.

162
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:54,172
They seem like great guys for
a punk band.

163
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,642
Isn't there anyone from
the band that you like?

164
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,242
No! For one thing,
Yasu belongs to Nana!

165
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,542
Huh? Yasu?

166
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,622
Those two are an item?

167
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,212
But actually they're not.

168
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,342
Now I'm confused.

169
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:10,592
Well, you see,
Yasu's really kind to Nana

170
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:12,112
so I misinterpret their relationship.

171
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:15,832
Right. But Yasu's like that
to anyone, right?

172
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,822
Like he's reached a higher spirit
like some monk.

173
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:18,922
He is bald, after all.

174
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,792
That's right.

175
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:25,802
Yasu's kind to Nobu
and Shin, and to me too.

176
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:28,842
It's true. Yasu's like that with everyone.

177
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:31,172
He's like an elder brother to me.

178
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:34,082
In addition, since Nana doesn't
have a family,

179
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,952
Yasu must be thinking of Nana
as a real younger sister.

180
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:40,782
He must be feeling the need to
treat her better than a sister.

181
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,822
I see. It's all becoming clearer.

182
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,622
Yasu's a great guy.

183
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,882
- Right?
- Huh?

184
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,552
Listen when someone's talking
to you!

185
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:51,762
I was saying, it was unexpected that
of the members in Nana's band,

186
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:54,602
you would quickly bring up Yasu's name.

187
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:55,662
Oh...

188
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,602
I thought you didn't like guys like that;
with such a scary look.

189
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:00,502
Mhm. But Yasu's different.

190
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,342
Once you get used to the skinhead,

191
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,672
you accept it as a charming part
of his character.

192
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:08,632
Also, I basically prefer calm,
composed guys who are older than me.

193
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,512
You know that, right, Jun-chan?

194
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,382
And on that note,
Yasu's very mature.

195
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,682
In addition, he's a lawyer.

196
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:14,752
That's not part of it.

197
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:17,852
Take away his looks and his job,
and he's still a great guy inside.

198
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:19,582
What?! Great guy inside?!

199
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,292
I never imagined the day would come

200
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,622
when I'd hear these words coming out
of your mouth.

201
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,352
Then good. You going for it?

202
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,952
Going where?

203
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,262
Wherever you need to.
Until you burn to ashes.

204
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,492
Junko, don't lead her on.

205
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:34,272
We're only talking about who
she'd prefer among those guys.

206
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,672
Th-That's right, Jun-chan!

207
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,272
She's blushing, she's blushing.

208
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,152
You seriously like him, by chance?

209
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:45,052
No way! I've never once thought
about Yasu and me getting together!

210
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,662
That's right.

211
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,822
Nothing can happen between Yasu
and me.

212
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:58,762
Oh, Nana. You're here.

213
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:01,632
THUMP!

214
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:05,562
G-Good evening.

215
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:07,862
Huh? Where is everyone?
Not here yet?

216
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:10,462
Nana's here, but she went out
to buy cigarettes.

217
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,512
I see.

218
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,972
What am I gonna do?

219
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:16,382
With Jun-chan bringing that subject up,
I can't look at him the same way.

220
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:19,952
And it's just us two here.
What are we gonna talk about?

221
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:26,062
Yasu. I brought this Trapnest pamphlet.
Wanna take a look?

222
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,382
Yeah, thanks.

223
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:29,062
Did you hear from either Nana or Ren?

224
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,432
Those two are safely back together.

225
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,652
Really? I'm happy about that.

226
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:36,132
Mhm. I'm really happy about it.

227
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,672
I was a bit down lately,
but now I'm feeling really good.

228
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:41,732
Huh? You were a bit down?
But you looked fine.

229
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,842
Was something troubling you?

230
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,752
Ah, no. If you don't wanna talk
about it, that's okay.

231
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,942
My boyfriend cheated on me
and dumped me.

232
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:08,262
He doesn't realize what he lost.
What an idiot.

233
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:12,302
But I was the one who said
I no longer wanted Shoji.

234
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,472
The reason I used those foolish words -
he dumped me -

235
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,842
was because I wanted him to
be kind to me like this.

236
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:22,442
But I no longer want a kind man.

237
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,382
Because it would hurt too much
when he betrays me.

238
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,052
Still, Yasu is very trustworthy.

239
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:35,892
Should I frequently see him like this,
I might really fall for him.

240
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,382
Everyone's late.

241
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,392
Would it be bad for me to fall
in love with him?

242
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:43,692
Where did Nana go to get cigarettes?

243
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:45,202
Should I not?

244
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,032
Why don't I ask?

245
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,812
Say, Yasu, do you have a girlfriend?

246
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,572
Unfortunately, I'm not popular
with the women.

247
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:55,502
What?! But I like you a lot!

248
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,012
Hey, Yasu!

249
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,942
Ren sent me a reply to my email.

250
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,992
He has a break in his tour schedule
on the seventh and eighth of next month,

251
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,422
so he'll be returning here then.

252
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,512
He says if those days are fine with us,
we'll have a mahjongg tournament then.

253
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:06,882
Is that so?

254
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,822
What's that?! I wanna join you!

255
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,662
Huh? You know how to
play mahjongg, Hachi?

256
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:11,632
I don't, but!

257
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,002
Good grief.

258
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,402
I wanna meet Ren too!

259
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:17,072
What? But Hachiko,
I thought you were into Takumi.

260
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,302
You cheater!

261
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,162
Don't call me Hachiko.

262
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,672
Shin's so not cute lately.

263
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,312
Where's Nana?

264
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:27,242
Oh. She's gone to Alaska
to buy cigarettes.

265
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:27,842
Alaska?!

266
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,442
Oh, is that Trapnest's pamphlet?
Let me see it.

267
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,812
Sure. Hachi brought it.

268
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,052
Oh, I wanna see it too.

269
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:37,542
Hachi? Even Yasu's calling me
that now.

270
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:41,592
Taking a close look like this,
Reira really is pretty.

271
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,292
Oh? Is she your type, Nobu?

272
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,492
I'm not sure about type,
but she's great.

273
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,502
Then next time let me introduce you
to a flight attendant who looks just like her.

274
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:51,732
Huh? A flight attendant?
Awesome!

275
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,302
She's also really great at...

276
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,512
- Shin!
- Don't want her!

277
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:55,872
I'm not gonna become your brother!

278
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:56,742
Brother?

279
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,972
Oh, hi Nana! You're awfully late.

280
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:03,782
Shin! How old are you?

281
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:06,722
Stop smoking, you brat.
Stop trying to act cool.

282
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,182
What's gotten into you all
of a sudden, Nana?

283
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,152
You were letting him until now.

284
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,662
She's scaring me! Save me, Hachi.

285
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:18,062
Yasu!

286
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:21,732
Yes, I get it. No smoking, right?
I'll comply.

287
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,392
No smoking?! Why?!

288
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,262
To increase my lung capacity.

289
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,062
Where you that impressed
by Reira's voice?

290
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:31,112
That bitch has nothing to do with it!
I'll kill you baldie!

291
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,602
Since that evening, Nana even
began doing sit-ups.

292
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,012
So I decided to workout with her.

293
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:41,542
Why are you doing sit-ups too?

294
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,682
I wanna have a slim waist for
when I find a boyfriend.

295
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,952
I see. Then, good luck with your efforts.

296
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,492
I wonder if Yasu will notice me
if I work hard at it.

297
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:57,802
Maybe not. I somehow can't picture
Yasu falling in love with me.

298
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,802
Nana-chin, make copies of this.

299
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,502
I don't think he sees me as a woman.

300
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,732
I get that same scent as that
of Mr. Mizukoshi.

301
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:10,112
My chances are slim.
Maybe I should give up.

302
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:14,052
I'm no longer at that age where I can
be satisfied with one-sided love.

303
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:17,752
Let's look elsewhere, Nana-chin.
Perhaps a party is the way to go.

304
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:21,822
Oh, somebody, hold me tight.

305
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:26,292
An e-mail.

306
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:32,702
REN
A MESSAGE FOR NANA

307
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:34,572
It's come!

308
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,542
An email from Ren!

309
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,672
Trapnest's Ren has sent
an email to my cell phone!

310
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:44,442
I cannot believe something like
this is happening to a commoner like me!

311
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,412
It's not addressed to me,
but can I read it?

312
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,112
Even if I shouldn't,
I wanna read it.

313
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:50,422
I'll read it!

314
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,522
A message for Nana
Apparently we're playing
at Nobu's place on the night of the 7th.
I'm free during the day,
so can I come by your place?

315
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,232
Yes, please come, darling.

316
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:59,792
That's the reply I gave.
Where's my treat?

317
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:02,732
Don't reply on my behalf!
You're not getting a treat.

318
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:06,232
I want Takumi's autograph!
Nana, you liar!

319
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:09,072
Listen. If Ren's dropping by
your place,

320
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:10,942
why not have
the mahjongg tournament there?

321
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,272
My place is too small for
a large number of people.

322
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,172
I agree!

323
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,842
That's fine, but we don't have
a mahjongg table.

324
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,882
I don't either.
Just put a cloth over the table.

325
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,592
The table by the window?
But if we play sitting beside each other,

326
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,142
it won't be much of a match
with everything visible to others.

327
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:25,522
We'll move the table, and sit around it.

328
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:27,352
- Don't smoke!
- Oops!

329
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:28,412
I can't wait!

330
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:29,292
MAHJONGG TOURNAMENT

331
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,262
MAHJONGG TOURNAMENT
The seventh can't come soon enough.

332
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:35,632
Trapnest's Ren is coming to our place.
Should I ask for his autograph?

333
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,832
If possible, we could have
a picture taken together?

334
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,422
What should I wear?

335
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,802
Should I buy that dress I wanted?

336
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:43,542
I should make an appointment
with the hairdresser too.

337
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,682
And I'll prepare a bunch of food.

338
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:47,172
What should I make?

339
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,582
I should start preparing
the night before.

340
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,152
I'll get up early to clean up,

341
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,452
and go to the flower shop
so I can decorate the place with flowers...

342
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,092
Chief, I'm expecting
an important guest tomorrow.

343
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,612
May I take the day off from work?

344
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,982
Of course not!

345
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,732
Thirty minutes before I get off work.

346
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,462
It's about time people start arriving.

347
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:08,132
Oh, I wanna hurry back home
and see Ren.

348
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,262
That's right. I should buy some paper
for autograph paper on my way home.

349
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:13,072
Please fire that girl, Chief!

350
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,172
Nana-chin, make copies of this. Huh?

351
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,402
Miss Komatsu has left for the day.

352
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:21,782
She left early?

353
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,002
We should fire her!

354
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:24,372
I guess you're right.

355
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:28,022
You know, you're really strong.

356
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,512
Could you be a little easier on me?

357
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,912
But I am.

358
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,522
Shin, you're being obnoxious.

359
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:34,992
I said, don't smoke!

360
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:38,292
But Ren's smoking.
So, it's okay for your own man to smoke.

361
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,322
You're a typical woman after all, Nana.

362
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:43,992
Don't you know there is a law that
says it's illegal for minors to smoke?!

363
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,432
But you had been smoking
ever since you were a minor.

364
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,242
So what's this about no smoking now?

365
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,172
Those around you are bothered by it.

366
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:55,512
I don't think it makes any difference.
There are many vocalists who smoke.

367
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:57,372
What you should do instead is
take some singing lessons?

368
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:00,542
Shut up! I don't need you
giving me advice!

369
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,582
Oh, could that be Hachi?

370
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:04,452
It could be Hachi.

371
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,082
Off you go.

372
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,822
Hey, it's not Hachi. It's Nana.

373
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:11,262
You're right.

374
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:13,722
How should I greet him?

375
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,332
"Pleased to meet you, I'm Nana."

376
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,072
No. "I'm Komatsu."

377
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:21,202
"I've been a big fan since
Trapnest's debut!"

378
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,672
Welcome home, Nana.

379
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,952
Say, Nana...

380
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:44,122
I made her cry.
What should I do?

381
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:47,862
That time, the reason my tears
suddenly came flowing out

382
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,302
was because I knew right away

383
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:54,632
that the dreamlike incident was
a treat you had arranged for me, Nana.

384
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:59,902
I felt more love than being thanked
a million times.

385
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,582
And that made me really happy.

386
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:12,952
I reached into the sky

387
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:19,462
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

388
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:24,842
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

389
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:30,832
Like colorful balloons

390
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,942
I'm alone

391
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:36,672
My hand had no place to go

392
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:43,312
And gently you took it

393
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:44,492
Starless night

394
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:48,692
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

395
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:54,492
I want to feel your warmth

396
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:56,372
Tears are falling down

397
00:21:56,372 --> 00:22:00,462
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

398
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:06,972
Of your hand holding mine
