00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:18,541
No doubt about it.
Goku has landed on Planet Namek.

2
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:25,782
Son...

3
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:49,307
<i>Touchdown. Touchdown on Planet Namek.</i>

4
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:55,576
<i>Disembarkation okay. Disembarkation okay.</i>
<i>Opening door. Opening door.</i>

5
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:00,243
What's this?
Whose spaceship is that?

6
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:09,753
It's Goku!
Goku has finally arrived!

7
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:33,018
I have to find those three quickly.

8
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:36,852
Be alive, Kuririn, Gohan, and Bulma.

9
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:53,305
There's one over this way...

10
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:56,975
...and one over that way...

11
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,410
What is this?

12
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,902
This place is packed with guys
that have ridiculously enormous <i>Ki</i>.

13
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,987
Gohan! Kuririn is in bad shape, too!
Both of them are near death!

14
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:13,651
They're close, where those three
other huge <i>Ki</i> are gathered.

15
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,329
I'll be right there.
Just hang in there.

16
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:20,131
Now's the time when
I show off the results

17
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,929
of the 100-times gravity
training I went through.

18
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,652
Gohan...

19
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:20,750
K- Kakarrot, you bastard...
are you finally here?

20
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,661
Goku...

21
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:28,666
Kuririn, I'll give you a senzu
bean right away too, okay?

22
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,003
Okay, Gohan, here's a senzu. Eat it.

23
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,006
Gohan! Hey, Gohan!

24
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,943
It's no good. Your neck is broken,
and you're barely breathing.

25
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:43,615
All right, that's okay,
Daddy will feed it to you.

26
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:46,951
H- hey! Who are you!?

27
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,621
One of those kids' friends?

28
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,623
I'm going to force it down, okay?

29
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:55,293
He just up and shows up in front of us.

30
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:59,297
Who is this guy?
He was pretty fast.

31
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:02,300
That bastard might be
even faster than you, huh?

32
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,536
Ha! Stop joking around.

33
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:08,734
Don't count me alongside that guy
with the trash-level battle power.

34
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,313
Yo! Can you stand?

35
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:17,315
F- Father!

36
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:20,318
D- did you come for us?

37
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,987
Hey, that kid who was
nearly dead is now!

38
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:24,989
H- how did he do that?

39
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:27,325
Are you okay, Gohan?

40
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:29,994
Father, be careful!
Those guys are...

41
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,330
Hold on, Gohan.

42
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,667
I have to go give
Kuririn a senzu, too.

43
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,603
O- okay...

44
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,605
You had a real rough time
of it, didn't you, Gohan?

45
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,597
Yes, I was helpless.

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,951
Why has Vegeta taken
such heavy damage, too?

47
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,620
He was beaten up by
that pineapple-headed one.

48
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,885
That guy has incredible strength.

49
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,395
Goku...

50
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,122
Kuririn, sorry to keep you waiting.

51
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,893
Here's a senzu.

52
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:17,308
I'm sort of happy,
and yet sort of unhappy...

53
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,299
Unhappy?

54
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:25,984
Again!?

55
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,986
He's recovered, as well.

56
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:31,322
W- what is going on here?

57
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:34,086
What the hell did they?

58
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,598
Goku, you must know how
strong those guys are, right?

59
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:42,267
The senzu may have restored us,

60
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,269
but we're just going
to get done in again.

61
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,603
As disappointing as it is to say,

62
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:48,606
this is too much for even
you to handle, Goku.

63
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,875
Those guys' strength
is in a whole other league.

64
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,278
Even Vegeta is absolutely
no match for them.

65
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,281
Oh, right, right...

66
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:59,083
Now that you mention it,
why was Vegeta beaten up by them?

67
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,286
Ain't they on the same side?

68
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,881
Yeah, apparently, they used
to be on the same side...

69
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:08,293
You don't have to talk.
Let me probe you.

70
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:09,961
P- probe?

71
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:12,725
F- Father?

72
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,228
I see...

73
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,606
I understand a lot now.

74
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,542
Like how you two have raised
your powers so much,

75
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,611
and how Bulma is safe.

76
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:02,947
The way the Dragon Balls were
taken from you, this Freeza guy,

77
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,949
and those guys over there, as well.

78
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,286
Y- you're kidding, right!?
How could you know that!?

79
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:13,451
I don't know. I just had a feeling
that if I did that, I would know.

80
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:18,963
Apparently, Vegeta is the same nasty guy
as ever, but whatever the reasons,

81
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:22,634
it looks like he saved your lives
during this fight, huh?

82
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:26,968
W- when did you gain this ability?

83
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:33,975
There's only one senzu left, huh?

84
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,924
Vegeta!

85
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,273
Eat that!

86
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:06,277
That was the last one, right? Why?

87
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,108
Father...

88
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,962
What is this? My body is!

89
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,330
T- that was stupid!

90
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,300
Were you planning to heal him
and have the four of us fight?

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,968
That won't do any good!

92
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,304
That ain't why.

93
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,308
I want to settle the score
with him later on Earth.

94
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,645
S- settle the score
with him later? You mean?

95
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,312
Yeah.

96
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,314
H- hey!

97
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,984
I'm going to take care
of these guys alone!

98
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,452
Take care of them alone!?

99
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,255
Father!

100
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,334
You're going to take care
of us alone, you say?

101
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:40,972
You're a strange bastard.

102
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:46,310
What is he thinking?
He hasn't gone crazy, has he?

103
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,646
Whatever he does,
there's no way he can beat them.

104
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:52,582
W- what's wrong with you, Father?

105
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,323
At least make this
a little bit entertaining.

106
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:04,784
Hey, how much battle power
does this trash bug have?

107
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,335
He really <i>is</i> a trash bug!

108
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:14,672
His battle power
is only about 5000!

109
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:21,100
Oh, that's disappointing.
He's just a big grandstander, huh?

110
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:29,687
This is strange, all right.
Why is he so unusually calm?

111
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:32,223
Doesn't he know what his
opponent's capabilities are?

112
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,025
That can't be right.

113
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,961
But I don't sense even a trace
of bloodlust from him.

114
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,969
D- don't tell me!

115
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,305
That bastard...

116
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:50,641
Hey, hey, hey, are you all right?

117
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:54,577
What are you trying to do with
a battle power as puny as that?

118
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:11,996
J- just a minute, I say!

119
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:16,000
M- my Gohan-<i>chan</i> is in trouble!
I can't just sit around!

120
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,671
This is it, right? Go on,
hurry and call Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

121
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,241
I- I don't know what sort of intuition
or whatever you've felt,

122
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,009
but there's no need to panic.

123
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,677
Hurry it up!

124
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:29,271
O- okay...

125
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:38,956
<i>Hey, Bulma, do you</i>
<i>read me? Hey, I say!</i>

126
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:39,957
<i>Hey!</i>

127
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:42,960
I- it's from Dad.

128
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,295
Hello? Dad?

129
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:45,296
<i>ls that you, Bulma?</i>

130
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:49,066
What's happened to Son-<i>kun</i>!?
When is he going to arrive?

131
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,635
It's been six days already!

132
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:54,238
<i>What, hasn't he arrived yet?</i>
<i>That's strange.</i>

133
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:57,308
<i>Maybe I messed up my calculations.</i>

134
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:00,645
<i>What about Gohan-chan!?</i>
<i>How is Gohan-chan doin!?</i>

135
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:01,979
Chichi-<i>san</i>...

136
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:06,651
<i>ls he safe?</i>
<i>Tell me he's safe!</i>

137
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:09,745
I- I don't know if he is!

138
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:15,425
<i>l'm</i> the one who wants to know
what's going on here.

139
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:32,343
Huh? This guy is crazy, all right.

140
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:35,680
He's about to be killed,
and here he is, smiling.

141
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,114
You can't beat me.

142
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,615
I can tell without
even fighting you.

143
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:47,625
Of all the things
he might have said!

144
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,627
Hey! Did you hear that?

145
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:53,563
This trash bug is talking
outrageously big!

146
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:58,302
H- he's funny in the head, all right.

147
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:00,972
He was never the sort
to talk big, either.

148
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:06,310
Father, you don't, by any chance,
not realize your opponent's power, do you?

149
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,049
D- don't tell me!
No, that can't be possible!

150
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,320
There's no way that lower-class
fighter Kakarrot...

151
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,658
...could ever become
a legendary Super Saiyan!

152
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:25,329
I can't take any more jokes from such
a deeply stupid bastard as you.

153
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,925
I'll shut you up forever
in no time flat.

154
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:36,340
T- they say that Super Saiyans
appear only once in a millennium.

155
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,612
A Super Saiyan, who can surpass barriers
that even the most gifted warriors cannot...

156
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:46,777
It couldn't be... that's just
a ridiculous fable!

157
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,019
E- even if the legend is true,

158
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,323
<i>l'm</i> the only one who has the potential
to become a Super Saiyan!

159
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:31,420
Okay, are you ready?

160
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:40,271
<i>Ginyu Special Corps,</i>
<i>ReaCoom Mach...</i>

161
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,434
<i>...Punch!!</i>

162
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:50,380
Whoop-oop-oop-oop-oop...

163
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:54,285
He vanished!

164
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:57,955
Huh? This can't be...
He's nowhere.

165
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:00,583
W- what the?

166
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:08,898
H- hey, what the hell is this?

167
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:13,404
What!?

168
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:14,305
W- why, you!

169
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,639
When did you manage to?

170
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,975
What!?

171
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:20,978
He's over there!?

172
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:25,316
<i>Looks like Vegeta is the only one</i>
<i>who caught where Goku was.</i>

173
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:28,410
<i>W</i>- <i>was he able to see</i>
<i>him move just now?</i>

174
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:37,595
You guys are in league with that
bad guy Freeza too, aren't you?

175
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,431
You can get away now
without getting hurt.

176
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,922
You'd better get out of here.

177
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,545
W- what the?

178
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:06,557
W- why, you bastard!

179
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:09,958
Looks like you're pretty sure
of your speed, at least.

180
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:12,897
But no matter how long this lasts,

181
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:16,300
you can't win if all
you ever do is run away.

182
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,638
All right, if that's how you want it,
let me show you my best move.

183
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:21,739
I'll warn you, though,

184
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,643
no matter how fast you run away,
it won't do you any good.

185
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:28,245
After all, ReaCoom-<i>sama</i>
is going to blow away

186
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:32,316
anything within a fairly
widespread area.

187
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:36,987
<i>We'll find out what Kakarrot's</i>
<i>true worth is this time.</i>

188
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,922
Have you made your peace?

189
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:44,588
I'm going to send all four
of you into the next world!

190
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,935
<i>ReaCoom...</i>

191
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,969
Y- y- yikes!

192
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,447
<i>...Ultra...</i>

193
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,281
<i>...Fighting...</i>

194
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:15,786
<i>...Miracle...</i>

195
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,108
Sorry about that.

196
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:34,311
You just left yourself so
wide open, I couldn't help it.

197
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,142
Sorry, sorry.

198
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:41,478
Y- y- you b- bastard...

199
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:49,260
D- did Father defeat him?

200
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,929
H- he couldn't have...
They're kidding, right?

201
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:54,265
However much that attack
took him by surprise,

202
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:57,001
he took the guy that Vegeta
and we couldn't do anything against,

203
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,764
no matter how hard we attacked him...

204
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:04,275
...with... with just one blow...

205
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,945
W- what's going on?
ReaCoom is...

206
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:11,437
That attack should have been nothing.

207
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:18,956
D- damn it all!

208
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:25,122
T- that was no ordinary attack!
You can't fool my eyes!

209
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,989
<i>That was an incredibly heavy strike!</i>

210
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,592
<i>H</i>- <i>he's clearly beyond</i>
<i>a Saiyan combat level.</i>

211
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,329
<i>But exactly</i> why <i>is he?</i>

212
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>What the hell kind of</i>
<i>special training did he do?</i>

213
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,668
<i>ls the legend true?</i>

214
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:11,675
<i>ls he... is he... a Super Saiyan!?</i>

215
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,677
<i>The Super Saiyan...</i>

216
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:20,082
<i>Had Goku now become the legendary</i>
<i>warrior that even Vegeta held in awe?</i>
