<i>Water.</i>

00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:06,352
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:08,483
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:09,782
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,043
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:19,158
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,509
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:30,896
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,742
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:34,970
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,745
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Two: The Avatar Returns

15
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,578
Yay! Aang's back!

16
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,932
I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare!

17
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,907
You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?

18
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:20,818
Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.

19
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:24,956
Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...

20
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:26,912
...we... we boobied... right into it.

21
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:32,221
Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship. Now we could all be in danger!

22
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:36,300
Don't blame Katara! I brought her there. It's my fault.

23
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:40,767
Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!

24
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,610
The foreigner is banned from our village!

25
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,695
Sokka, you're making a mistake.

26
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,145
No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!

27
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:54,105
Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see?

28
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:58,412
Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time. Fun.

29
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:01,677
Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!

30
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,568
You should try it sometime.

31
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,749
Get out of our village. Now!

32
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:09,139
Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.

33
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:12,152
Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden.

34
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:16,438
Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.

35
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:19,373
Fine! Then I'm banished too!

36
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,401
C'mon, Aang, let's go!

37
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:23,720
Where do you think you're going?

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,189
To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!

39
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,117
I am? Great!

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,004
Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?

41
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:46,802
Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.

42
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:51,840
So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?

43
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,950
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.

44
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,150
Where will you go?

45
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:58,725
Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.

46
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:05,510
Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.

47
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,490
It was nice meeting everyone.

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,806
Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.

49
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,906
Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!

50
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeh, I thought so.

51
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:26,247
Aang! Don't go! We'll miss you!

52
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:29,128
I'll miss you too.

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,593
Come on, boy.

54
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,253
Katara, you'll feel better after you...

55
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:52,189
You happy now? There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!

56
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,999
All right! Ready our defenses!

57
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,593
The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!

58
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,226
But, I gotta...

59
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:04,450
And no potty breaks!

60
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:19,106
Yeh, I liked her too.

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,962
The village!

62
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,319
Appa, wait here!

63
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:42,816
Oh man!

64
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,654
Ohhh, man!

65
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,815
Sokka, get out of the way!

66
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,784
Where are you hiding him?

67
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:39,943
He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?

68
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:50,726
I know you're hiding him!

69
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,332
Show no fear!

70
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,536
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.

71
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,565
Hi... Aang. Thanks for comin'.

72
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,473
Looking for me?

73
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,733
You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?

74
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,794
Aang?

75
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,495
No way.

76
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,928
I've spent years preparing for this encounter.

77
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:28,293
Training. Meditating. You're just a child!

78
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:31,564
Well, you're just a teenager.

79
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:48,930
If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?

80
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,501
No, Aang! Don't do this!

81
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,554
Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.

82
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,675
Take care of Appa for me until I get back.

83
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:15,450
Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.

84
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,529
We have to go after that ship, Sokka.

85
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,245
Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.

86
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:58,169
Katara, I...

87
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:02,942
Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will.

88
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,119
I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I...

89
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,371
Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?

90
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,582
Sokka!

91
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:15,551
Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.

92
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,137
He's not my...

93
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,476
Whatever.

94
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,867
What do you two think you're doing?

95
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:27,346
You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you.

96
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:31,807
It's been so long since I've had hope.

97
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:36,698
But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.

98
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,316
And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.

99
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah... okay, Gran.

100
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:49,467
Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance.

101
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:57,116
You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.

102
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:02,551
There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.

103
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,262
Appa!

104
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:10,849
You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?

105
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,372
This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.

106
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:23,132
I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.

107
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:28,469
Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And take this to my quarters.

108
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:33,507
Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?

109
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:50,530
So... I guess you never fought an airbender before.

110
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:53,840
I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.

111
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,008
Silence!

112
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:17,363
The Avatar has escaped!

113
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:27,551
Go. Fly. Soar.

114
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,844
Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.

115
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:35,731
Up. Ascend. Elevate.

116
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,391
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.

117
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:42,993
Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?

118
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:52,960
What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?

119
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,500
You did it, Sokka!

120
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:08,264
He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's...!

121
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,850
I mean, big deal, he's flying.

122
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,462
You haven't seen my staff around, have you?

123
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,050
Thanks anyway!

124
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,763
Sorry...

125
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,410
My staff!

126
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:12,425
Looks like I underestimated you.

127
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,867
What is that?

128
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,998
Appa!

129
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,727
Aang! No!

130
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:21,692
Aang! Aang! Aang...!!

131
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,945
Did you see what he just did?

132
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:52,974
Now that was some waterbending!

133
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,622
Aang! Are you okay?

134
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:08,662
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Thanks for coming.

135
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,162
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.

136
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:12,441
I dropped my staff.

137
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:14,501
Got it!

138
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,883
Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!

139
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,616
Katara!

140
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,457
Hurry up, Sokka!

141
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:57,745
I'm just a guy with a boomerang, I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.

142
00:18:57,715 --> 00:19:00,563
Yip yip! Yip yip!

143
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,991
Shoot them down!

144
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:44,609
Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.

145
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:50,235
That kid, Uncle, just did this. I won't underestimate him again.

146
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:53,862
Dig this ship out and follow them!

147
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:58,437
As soon as you're done with that.

148
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:09,233
How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

149
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:13,049
I don't know. I just sort of... did it.

150
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,438
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

151
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:21,239
Because... I never wanted to be.

152
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,124
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return...

153
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,361
...and finally put an end to this war.

154
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,506
And how am I going to do that?

155
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:42,738
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?

156
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:44,514
That's what the monks told me.

157
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:48,512
Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.

158
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,267
We can learn it together!

159
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:54,183
And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.

160
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:57,503
I'd like that. I'd really like that.

161
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,307
Then we're in this together.

162
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:01,382
All right, but before I learn waterbending...

163
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:06,559
...we have some serious business to attend to here, here, and here.

164
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,160
What's there?

165
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:10,182
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

166
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:13,783
Then waaaay over here we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.

167
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:16,512
Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys.

168
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,685
They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!
