00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,090
Goosebumps Indeed! The Handsome Warrior Zarbon's Demonic Transformation.

2
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,124
What?

3
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:38,619
You say I've awakened your true power,
which has been dormant for many years?

4
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,965
That's correct.

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,043
That's a hilarious joke!

6
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:57,640
I will tell you why I have let my true power
lie dormant and unused before you die.

7
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:03,655
In order to display my true power,
I must transform myself.

8
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:07,659
However, my transformed
appearance is unattractive.

9
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,663
As someone who prefers beauty,
I cannot abide it.

10
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:15,333
But I will choose to transform
before I choose death.

11
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:19,429
Transform, you say?
The way we Saiyans do?

12
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:25,166
Those who are cornered will say the most
absurd things out of desperation.

13
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:29,781
Unlike a Saiyan, I do not transform
into something larger than is needed.

14
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,341
My power just increases.

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,284
Overwhelmingly so!

16
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:50,035
Show me!

17
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,704
You need not ask.

18
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,640
I will show it to you, now!

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,314
W- what is this!?

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,922
My appearance isn't the only
thing that has transformed!

21
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,414
Don't be too terrified by my power!

22
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:40,018
Dende, aren't we to the
Grand Elder's place yet?

23
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,686
It's a little bit farther ahead.

24
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:46,282
We have to do something while Vegeta
and that other guy are fighting.

25
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,530
You know, I get the feeling
that a lot of time has passed

26
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,034
since we landed on this planet,

27
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:59,704
but it doesn't look like the sun
is setting one bit, huh? Why is that?

28
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:02,974
The sun doesn't go down.

29
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:07,638
After all, we have three suns,
and they all come out in turn.

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,990
Then, you don't have
night on your world?

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,924
No, we don't.

32
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,421
Well, okay...

33
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,611
<i>D</i>- <i>dammit!</i>

34
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:14,564
That's my limit...
I've got to have a little rest...

35
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:27,908
Still, I've conquered this 50-times gravity
a lot faster than I thought I would.

36
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:35,759
Looks like that duel with Vegeta
wasn't altogether useless.

37
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:47,104
I wonder if Tenshinhan and those guys
are training under Kaio-<i>sama</i>.

38
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:06,958
<i>Listen to me, Goku.</i>
<i>This is an order from Kaio.</i>

39
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,294
<i>Do not go near him.</i>

40
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:11,963
<i>l'm not just saying this</i>
<i>for your own sake.</i>

41
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,232
<i>l'm saying this for the sake</i>
<i>of everyone on Earth, Namek,</i>

42
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:17,302
<i>and many other planets as well.</i>

43
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,071
<i>lf you launch some shoddy attack</i>
<i>on Freeza and get him angry,</i>

44
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:24,309
<i>something terrible is going to happen.</i>

45
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:28,245
<i>You have to leave that guy alone.</i>

46
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:37,751
I can't go resting now! All right!

47
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,284
Hold it!

48
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,634
Hold it!

49
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,339
Hold it! Hold it!

50
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,170
Hold it!

51
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,777
" Rice catch!" Get it?
That was a great pun!

52
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,286
Hold it!

53
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,301
Dammit, I'm not about to lose!

54
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,459
No matter how you might
struggle, you cannot beat me!

55
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:54,143
Incredible! Even as far away as we are,
I can feel the <i>Ki</i> from their battle.

56
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,275
My power now doesn't even compare
to what it was before I transformed!

57
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:38,792
<i>l</i>- <i>it's no good... Even after</i>
<i>l powered up on Earth...</i>

58
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:06,313
I'm not going to let you die easy!

59
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:26,599
Vegeta, is that all for you?

60
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,294
You're not showing yourself, huh?

61
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:47,628
Looks like you weren't able to move,
and now you've drowned.

62
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:05,616
You did give me a hard time,

63
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:08,319
and even forced me to take on
my loathsome transformation.

64
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,483
Now then, I guess I should go
report this to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

65
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:41,352
Why did I come to this planet, anyhow!?

66
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:45,789
We can't get the Dragon Balls,
and our spaceship has been wrecked!

67
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,696
I'm surprised that you can be so calm.

68
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:56,033
It's just a little while longer. When Father
gets here, he'll manage to do something.

69
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,703
I hope Son-<i>kun</i> gets here soon.

70
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:03,800
If I'm forced to stay cooped up in a place
like this for too long, I'll go crazy!

71
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,212
I wonder if Kuririn-<i>san</i> has
found that Grand Elder person.

72
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:22,660
The <i>Ki</i> have subsided.

73
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,594
The fight is over.

74
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:29,765
Which one of them won?

75
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,937
I don't know.

76
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,338
Whichever one of them won,
it's all the same. Let's hurry.

77
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,649
Which way? Should we just
keep going straight like this?

78
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,584
Um, a little more to the left.

79
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,670
There it is. You see that
tall rock over there, right?

80
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,103
T- that one, huh?

81
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,948
Whew, that sure was a long way.

82
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,297
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> is inside that house.

83
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:10,301
I'm surprised it's still even here.
As conspicuous a location as this is,

84
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:14,397
it's only a matter of time
before those bad guys find it.

85
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:39,254
He hasn't already been killed, right?

86
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,095
He couldn't be...

87
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,957
Nail-<i>san</i>! Thank goodness!
You're all right!

88
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,619
<i>H</i>- <i>he looks exactly like Piccolo!</i>

89
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:14,231
Glad you're here, Dende.

90
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:18,565
Visitor, Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> is roughly
familiar with the course of events.

91
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:22,973
Then, Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>
does know what is happening?

92
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:25,976
T- that will spare us
the time of explaining, then.

93
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:30,981
Both of you, come inside.
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> will see you.

94
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,919
Um, if he already knows
what is generally going on,

95
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,912
why hasn't he left this unsafe location?

96
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:46,997
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> has grown too aged.
He is aware that his death is approaching.

97
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:52,670
The only thing he could do is to remain
here quietly, with me here protecting him.

98
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,675
I had heard that his death was near,
but I didn't know it was so close.

99
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,267
Come, inside.

100
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,947
<i>That guy is capable.</i>

101
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:07,441
<i>l can sense quite a bit of power from him,</i>
<i>compared to the other Namekians.</i>

102
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,616
Up.

103
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,116
Right.

104
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,972
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>,
Dende and a visitor.

105
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,312
<i>H</i>- <i>he's huge!</i>

106
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:39,984
Welcome. You are an Earthling, correct?

107
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:47,324
First, I would like to offer my gratitude
for rescuing my child Dende here. Thank you.

108
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:51,317
N- not at all. We didn't
do anything all that great.

109
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:43,314
That miserable Zarbon!
T- this isn't over yet!

110
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,817
I'm going to become even stronger!

111
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:50,654
And then, I'm going to defeat
both Zarbon and Freeza!

112
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:55,489
I- I'm not about to turn over
the Dragon Balls to anyone!

113
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:03,667
<i>Vegeta was alive.</i>

114
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:10,674
<i>However, the hidden power possessed</i>
<i>by Freeza and Zarbon was fearsome.</i>

115
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:13,677
<i>And after finally meeting him,</i>

116
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:17,681
<i>would the Grand Elder be of any</i>
<i>help to Kuririn and the others?</i>

117
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:25,611
<i>The tangled battle of good and evil</i>
<i>surrounding the Dragon Balls yet continues.</i>
