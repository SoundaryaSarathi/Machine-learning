-These rice balls are pretty good.
-Cha!

Ha, ha. Of course they are.

16
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,919
Argh!

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,256
When you got lemons,
you make lemonade

18
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,842
and when you’ve got rice,
you make rice balls.

19
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,430

where that came from.

Are you crazy, Ash?
You just made Togepi cry.

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,784
Oh, well, I thought someone
there was trying to shoot us.

-Where?
-There.

36
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,080

You were probably just seeing things.

If you don’t believe me, see for
yourself. Squirtle! I choose you!

Squirtle!

-Is everything okay?
-Uh.

47
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,365
It’s okay. It’s working just fine.

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,327
I wasn’t asking about your camera.
I was worried about you.

49
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,830
But, you see, this camera is my life.

50
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,666
Get yourself a new life.
Why were you spying on us?

51
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,460
I wasn’t spying on you.

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,380
My name’s Todd
and I love taking pictures.

53
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,633
You didn’t have to sic your Squirtle on me
and flip out like that.

54
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,552
Come on.

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,597
You should consider it an honor that I
want to take a picture of your Pikachu.

56
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,225
-Pika?
-Oh, really?

57
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,812
If you wanted to take a picture,
why didn’t you just ask us first?

58
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,024
I didn’t want Pikachu to know
I was taking pictures of it.

59
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,694
I never like them to look posed.

60
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,532
You see, I am the number one
Pokémon photo master!

61
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,950
[both] Did he say...

62
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,287
-Masker?
-That’s right. I’m the...

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,916
-Oh, not masker. I said master.
-Uh-huh.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,126
Pika.

65
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,881
You may not recognize my name

66
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,049
but I’m sure you heard of the photographer

67
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,721
who took the only known photo
of the legendary Pokémon Aerodactyl.

68
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
-Uh...
-Have you?

69
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,517
-Uh, not me.
-[Todd groans]

70
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,313
How is it possible
that they never heard of me?

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,315
Pika, pika.

72
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,152
Here!
Look at this issue of <i>Pokémon Times.</i>

73
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,530
-That’s my picture of an Aerodactyl.
-There’s his name.

74
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,408
Hey, yeah. I guess you are famous.

75
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,203
Wah! Hey! That’s me!

76
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,163
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,373
This is Aerodactyl, the ancient Pokémon.

78
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,503
Right, but see here? This is me.

79
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,175
-[roaring]
-Argh!

80
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:08,725
See? I told you. That’s me getting
carried away by that Aerodactyl.

81
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,979
I guess you’re right.
That puny little thing really is you.

82
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,314
Puny?

83
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:19,277
Hmm, it’s incredible how two people can be
brought together by a single photograph.

84
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,238
It’s funny when you think about it.

85
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,698
You’re in the picture
and nobody knows who you are

86
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,451
and I take your picture,
and I’m world famous.

87
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,286
Yeah, that’s real hysterical.

88
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,956
Uh, I’m sorry I scared you.

89
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,209
Let me make some breakfast for you.
You like pancakes?

90
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,170
-Uh, pancakes?
-That’s right.

91
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:42,092
-You bet. I love pancakes.
-I haven’t had pancakes in a long time.

92
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,136
-That sounds great, Todd.
-Okay.

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,431
And I’m sure you won’t mind
if I take Pikachu’s picture.

94
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,600
-Uh...
-Pika?

95
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,853
Don’t worry.
I’ll be sure to capture your best side.

96
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,813
Pi?

97
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,361
-Let’s chow down.
-Pika Pikachu!

98
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,656
[Brock] Mmm!
You have to give me your recipe.

99
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,784
-[Misty] These are delicious.
-Pika, pika.

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,956
Pika, pika?

101
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,084
Okay, Pikachu, uh, keep eating.

102
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:21,006
Just pretend I’m not in the room,
all right? Relax. Just act natural.

103
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,382
That’s fabulous.

104
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,343
Now smile. Smile!

105
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,305
-This is going to be great!
-Pika?

106
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,266
[Todd and Pikachu groaning]

107
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,813
-Pi! Pikachu!
-[Ash chuckles]

108
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,941
The camera’s shutter
must have scared Pikachu.

109
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,528
-We don’t get our picture taken too much.
-Pika.

110
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,365
There’s nothing to be afraid of, Pikachu.
Let’s try again.

111
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,493
-Okay, smile.
-[whimpering]

112
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,662
Pika?

113
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,749
I’m sorry. I can’t work like this.

114
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,334
What do you mean, Todd?

115
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,837
Pokémon should be photographed naturally,
not posing.

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,299
That’s the only way
I want my pictures of Pokémon.

117
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,469
Why is it such a big deal
whether the Pokémon pose or don’t pose?

118
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,931
Take a look at those photographs
over there.

119
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,894
They’re all Pokémon
living in their own natural habitats.

120
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,148
Those aren’t poses.
Look how peaceful they are.

121
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,276
Don’t those shots show Pokémon
the way they ought to be?

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,074
Wow. I’ve never seen Pokémon
pictures like that before.

123
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,620
-They all look so cute and carefree.
-Yeah, they’re happy.

124
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,623
With my pictures,
I can show the whole world

125
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,584
how happy and beautiful Pokémon
are in the wild.

126
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,212
-Yeah.
-That’s great.

127
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,132
You have a real talent for showing Pokémon
the way they should be seen.

128
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,135
That’s why I never want to shoot
a Pokémon that’s posed.

129
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,806
-And looks sad and scared.
-Pika.

130
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,810
Well, Pikachu may
not like being photographed,

131
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,229
but Pikachu is not my only
Pokémon, you know?

132
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,272
I’ve got others in these Poké Balls.

133
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,274
How about a shot of Pidgeotto?

134
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,403
Pidgeo!

135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,489
-Or Bulbasaur?
-Bulbasaur!

136
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,951
[Misty]
I have Pokémon you can shoot too.

137
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,704
[Brock] Hey, how about taking
some shots of my Pokémon?

138
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,166
See, Todd? I have plenty of Pokémon
you can take great pictures of.

139
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,002
-Me too.
-Don’t forget me!

140
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,171
Uh, that’s very nice, but no thanks.

141
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,800
What’s the matter, Todd?
Is there something wrong with our Pokémon?

142
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,095
No, they’re fine, but I only want
to take pictures of Pikachu.

143
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,806
What’s so important
about taking Pikachu's picture?

144
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,559
-Well, you see...
-No, we don’t see. Tell us.

145
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
I can’t tell you why.

146
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,856
What do you mean,
"I can’t tell you why"?

147
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,774
That’s all I can say.

148
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,111
I have to take Pikachu
and that’s all there is to it!

149
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,572
Mm. Then go ahead.

150
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,532
But you won’t have much luck.

151
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:57,495
Ha, ha. You just watch.
I’ll capture you, Pikachu,

152
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,331
like no other photographer
could capture you.

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,792
Pi, pika.

154
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,355
You must help us. We really need you
to capture this Pikachu.

155
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,569
Oh, please.
This Pikachu is so important to us.

156
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,945
Pikachu?

157
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,948
Hmm, these pictures rot.

158
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:39,537
Please. Grant this old woman
one last wish before she passes on.

159
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,414
[all sobbing]

160
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,547
[in mind] <i>It’s so sad. They must have</i>
<i>raised a Pikachu just like this one.</i>

161
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:54,385
<i>I’ll do it. I’ll use my camera to capture</i>
<i>Pikachu on film for them.</i>

162
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,348
-Don’t worry! I’ll take the job!
-You mean you’ll do it?

163
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,350
I’ll capture the Pikachu perfectly.

164
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,019
[all sobbing]

165
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,563
Thank goodness we found you
before it was too late.

166
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,649
We’re very grateful.

167
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:12,112
But we’d appreciate it if you’d not tell
anyone that we’ve been here.

168
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,032
No problem! I would never reveal
my clients’ identities.

169
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,495
[in mind]
<i>I have to grant the old woman’s wish.</i>

170
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,624
<i>I have to capture</i>
<i>the perfect picture of Pikachu.</i>

171
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:30,046
[Jessie] Um, all right, Meowth,
where did you find this Todd kid?

172
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,257
Can he... [gulps] get Pikachu?

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,342
It says in the <i>Pokémon Times</i>

174
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,428
that this kid’s the best
at capturing Pokémon.

175
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,933
And he did show us that huge photo album
with all the Pokémon he said he’d taken.

176
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,895
He even said he wanted to take a shot
at Pikachu or something like that.

177
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,647
[both grunt]

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,693
-[Jessie] Let me have it!
-[James] I need protein! Uh!

179
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,028
[chomping]

180
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,948
You’re not acting like a nice old lady.

181
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,160
Ha, that’s because I’m not nice or old.

182
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,454
Ah, time to lose this guy’s disguise.

183
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,623
[all] Surprise! Surprise!

184
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,292
Yeah, right.

185
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,429
-Pika Pikachu!
-[crashing]

186
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,265
-[Ash] Hold it right there!
-Pika!

187
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,935
-[Todd] Hey, what?
-[chuckles]

188
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,897
-You got to be quicker.
-Chu!

189
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,898
[sighs]

190
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,445
[Todd]
Ready? Ah, not again.

191
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,949
-Wah! Missed again, Todd!
-Chu!

192
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,912
Argh, I’ll get that picture
if it’s the last thing I do.

193
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,999
Remember the last time
we made a trap like this, Meowth?

194
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,918
Yeah, I really dug it.

195
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,712
Why don’t you try more digging
and less talking?

196
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,007
Those twerps are on their way
and they will be here any minute... Ooh!

197
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,178
Uh, I think I just discovered something.

198
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,513
What are you stopping for?
Keep digging.

199
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,973
[both] Roger!

200
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,268
Patty-cake, patty-cake, it’s a trap.

201
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,897
Huh? It’s that Todd kid!
Hurry up! Disguises on!

202
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,190
[both] Huh?

203
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,611
Look at yourselves.
You got them mixed up!

204
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,154
[both] Huh?

205
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,202
I’m sorry. I haven’t taken that Pikachu
for you yet.

206
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,871
We’re sure you’ll get it sooner or later.

207
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,500
And just as a little insurance policy,
we even dug this trap--

208
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,004
[Jessie chuckling]

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,508
Hmm. This dirt is soft.

210
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,844
May be a good place to wait for Pikachu.

211
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,473
All right. Tripod, check.

212
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,518
Camera, check. Lens, check.

213
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay, now I’m ready.

214
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,566
Right on time.

215
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,614
Pika. Pi, pi.

216
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,449
Pikachu must really hate cameras.

217
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,660
I’ve never seen it act
so nervous before.

218
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,914
Oh, it’s too bad Todd won’t get
the kind of picture he’s so great at.

219
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,875
I don’t see what’s so great
about that Todd.

220
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,921
He doesn’t even understand the feelings
of the Pokémon he takes pictures of.

221
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,799
[in mind]
<i>I don’t understand the Pokémon's feelings?</i>

222
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,928
-I say we just forget about Todd...
-[all] Argh!

223
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,722
[gasps]

224
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,725
-They’re gone!
-Ow! My arm!

225
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,019
Whose idea was it to put
a hole in the road?

226
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,563
[Brock]
Who else would have an idea like that?

227
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,273
Just Team Rocket.

228
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,943
-We finally caught them.
-They fell for our trap.

229
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,446
Usually we’re the ones to fall in.

230
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,115
Oh, I can’t wait.
Soon we’ll have our Pikachu.

231
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,536
Let’s watch and learn from the expert.

232
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,871
It’s capture time!

233
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,499
-How did you get down there?
-Easy. We fell.

234
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,837
-You’ve got to get us out of here.
-Uh, I think I have a rope.

235
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,798
Pi...

236
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,593
-Are you okay, Pikachu?
-Pikachu!

237
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,597
Huh? Ah, that’s the Pikachu
I want to capture.

238
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,393
-Great. Now throw us that rope, Todd.
-What is that boy doing?

239
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,146
He’s taking a picture of Pikachu.

240
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,731
[all sigh]

241
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,733
-Meowth!
-Huh?

242
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,986
The magazine says he’s, uh... Aw.

243
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,491
"The best at capturing Pokémon on film."

244
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,618
Ah, now I get it.

245
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,246
The article said
that he’s good at capturing them on film.

246
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,125
I thought he actually captures them.
An amusing mistake.

247
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,877
[both] You’re the mistake!

248
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,046
Ah! Meowth!

249
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,091
All right, hold it.

250
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:49,472
I did it! Okay, now, just a few more.
Huh?

251
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,478
-Oh, no. Grab the rope!
-Huh?

252
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,939
The bottom of the pit is crumbling.

253
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,149
You’ve got to get out
before it falls through.

254
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,236
Huh? [shouting]

255
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,114
-Ash! Oh!
-Pikachu! Huh?

256
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,949
[grunts]

257
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,076
Pikachu, don’t let go.

258
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,912
-Pika!
-[Todd] Ash, Pikachu!

259
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,873
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, we’re okay.

260
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,334
Grab on to something quick.
There’s not much time.

261
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,253
Huh? Uh...

262
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,385
Ah! There’s nothing to grab on to!

263
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,223
-I’ve got to think of something fast.
-Oh, come on, Pikachu!

264
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,685
-[gasps]
-Agh! We’re going to fall!

265
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,145
I know!

266
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,106
-[screaming]
-Ash, grab ahold!

267
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,277
[groans]

268
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,705
Ash, Pikachu, just hang on.

269
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,166
You saved us.

270
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,168
-Pika.
- Ah!

271
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,881
-I’ll pull you up now.
-But your camera is ruined!

272
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,383
You sacrificed your camera to save us?

273
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,969
Don’t you worry about my camera, Ash.

274
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,598
-You just worry about holding on.
-Okay!

275
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:18,311
[grunts]

276
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,813
[Jessie]
You did a great job for us, Todd.

277
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,066
-Huh?
-Prepare for trouble.

278
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,902
[James] Make it double.

279
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,321
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

280
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,740
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

281
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,201
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

282
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,329
To extend our reach to the stars above.

283
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,789
-Jessie!
-James!

284
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,750
-Huh?
-Team Rocket!

285
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,878
Team Rocket blast off
at the speed of light.

286
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,631
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

287
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,382
Meowth! That’s right!

288
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,845
-And we just netted ourselves a Pikachu!
-Pika!

289
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,681
-Pikachu!
-Why did you trick me?

290
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,392
You tricked us first, little shutterbug.

291
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,438
We wanted you to take Pikachu,
not take its picture.

292
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,108
But thanks for helping us snap up
the real Pikachu.

293
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,362
And just to show our gratitude,
why don’t you have one of these?

294
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,241
[both screaming]

295
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,077
[grunting]

296
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,872
Looks like I need a little work on my aim.
Ugh.

297
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,834
[groaning]

298
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,171
[panting]

299
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,091
-Todd!
-Pikachu!

300
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,593
Ha, ha. Squirm all you want.

301
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,762
You’ll never get out of this rubber bag.

302
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,557
-Could we wind this up now, please?
-Will do.

303
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,517
[groans]

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,477
Huh?

305
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,480
-Ha-ha.
-And the final pitch...

306
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,731
-[Ash] Hold it!
-Huh?

307
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,193
Okay, everybody,
just smile for the camera.

308
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,654
You’re going to love this shot.

309
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,949
-[giggling]
-What’s the magic word?

310
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,409
[all] Cheese!

311
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,371
-Oh, let me just take the shine off.
-[Ash] Now look to the right.

312
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,831
[all gasp]

313
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,922
Oh, look at my face.

314
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,757
-You ruined the shot.
-Oh!

315
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,134
[grunts]

316
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:18,222
Oh. Okay, Todd,
let’s give Team Rocket our best shot.

317
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,225
-[all gasp]
-[Ash] Bulbasaur, go!

318
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,395
-Bulbasaur!
-Bulbasaur, Razor Leaf, now!

319
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,105
Bulba!

320
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,066
-[all shrieking]
-Cut it out!

321
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,572
-Run for it, Pikachu!
-Pi! Pikachu!

322
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,074
Bulbasaur, give them your Vine Whip!

323
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,995
-Bulbasaur!
-[all groaning]

324
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,876
Quick! Get to the water!

325
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,548
[all gasp]

326
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,801
-[Jessie] A waterfall!
-[all yelp]

327
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,304
But first, a poem.

328
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,724
Team rocket drifted down the stream
and now we scream!

329
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,935
[all screaming]

330
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,274
-Nice work, Ash!
-Thanks.

331
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,653
-Bulbasaur, return!
-Bulba!

332
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,615
-Hey, Ash! Todd! Over here!
-Are you okay?

333
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,242
You guys missed all the excitement.

334
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,536
You should have brought a camera.

335
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,039
-[both] Huh?
-Pika-pi! Chu!

339
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,095
I don’t get it. How come you guys
are acting like friends?

340
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,057
We are friends, Misty,
because we have something in common.

341
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,809
We both like Pokémon.

but this time, I’ll make an exception.

my new friends forever.
