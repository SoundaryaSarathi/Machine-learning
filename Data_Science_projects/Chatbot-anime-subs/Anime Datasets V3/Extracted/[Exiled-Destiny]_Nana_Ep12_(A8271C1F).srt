4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,870
Ever since I was a child,

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,400
my dream was to become
a beautiful bride.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
There was really nothing else
that I truly wanted to be.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,190
When I was darkness at that time

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,030
With trembling lips

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,120
In a corner of a room I cry

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,200
The more I struggle

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,040
The more this wound deepens

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,200
The broken promise hurt me

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,940
Nobody can save me

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,120
God, I have only one request

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,750
Stop tearing apart my love

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,090
I need your love

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm a broken rose

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,260
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,430
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,200
I need your love

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,510
I'm a broken rose

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,440
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,400
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,380
I wanna need your love

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,610
I'm a broken rose

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,950
I wanna need your love

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,920
Wedding funds?!

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,070
That's right.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,600
Listen, a wedding is a major event,
so it's gonna cost money.

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,410
So a bit at a time, I had saved money
for that special day.

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,600
It's not easy for a parent with
three daughters, you know.

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,750
So why are you suddenly depositing
such important funds

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,770
into my account?

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,150
Well, you eloped, didn't you?

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,320
Huh?!

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,580
I'm home.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,050
Hey, Nami.

38
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,090
- Where have you been
- Mom.

39
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,320
- until this hour?
- Mom!

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
I was at, like, a karaoke bar.

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,590
- Come on!
- Mom!

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,460
Can't you at least call

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,890
- if you're gonna be late?!
- Mom!

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,760
Hello, Nana?

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,490
Mom, what makes you think
I eloped?!

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,060
Hello, Sis?

47
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,400
Nami?

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,200
How are you?
How's life in Tokyo treating you?

49
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,760
How are things with your boyfriend?

50
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,270
Nami! It's you, isn't it?

51
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,170
You're the one giving Mom
strange ideas, aren't you?

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,040
What? Not really.

53
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,510
All I said was you had gone
to Tokyo to live with a guy.

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,520
You're wrong!

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,120
There's no need to hide it.
I envy you.

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,880
You get to have sex every day, right?

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,680
Goodness, will you watch what you say?

58
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,360
Go on and take a bath.

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,960
Huh? But I wanna talk some more.

60
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,460
- Y-Young women
- I took a bath already.

61
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,100
- today will
- Where?

62
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,370
- talk about s-sex
- That hurt!

63
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,640
- in front of their parents?
- You kicked me!

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,900
Hello, Nana?

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,740
- Anyway, you're legally an adult now,
- This sucks. I should've

66
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,940
- so do whatever you wish
- applied to a university

67
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,070
- with that money.
- in Tokyo, too.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,830
Just don't get divorced
and come running home.

69
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,080
D-Divorced?!

70
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,410
Don't cause me any more trouble
than you already have. Bye.

71
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,040
Mom?

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,780
This is no laughing matter!

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,990
I thought she would ask me
to return home

74
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,060
because she was worried
or something.

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,960
But don't come running home?
Would a parent say that?

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,990
I'm not even married yet!

77
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,500
Way to go, Natsuko!
What a cool mother!

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,940
Are you drunk, Nana?

79
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,770
No, I'm not drunk.

80
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,740
Why even ask?

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm back. I bought you cigarettes, Nana.

82
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,470
Yasu! Welcome back!

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,740
You've had a few, I see.

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,090
I love you!

85
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,990
I get it. So don't jump on me.

86
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,650
Wh-What about Nobu and Shin?

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Yeah.

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,360
Nobu passed out on the sidewalk,
so Shin took him home.

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,790
I-I see. Nobu was drinking a lot,
after all.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,690
That Shin.
Surprisingly, he just doesn't get drunk.

91
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,930
Is it only water to him?

92
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,270
Don't fall asleep.

93
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,670
Give me a break.

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,570
Come on, Nana.

95
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,680
It's the first time I saw Nana with
her guard down and drunk like that.

96
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,240
She's kinda cute.

97
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,710
She must be really happy
that Yasu has come.

98
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,490
She even kissed him
in the mix of things.

99
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,150
And on top of that, telling him
"I love you"?

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,820
But it wasn't as if Yasu was
at all surprised by it.

101
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,260
Those two could be dating, after all.

102
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,460
What are they doing with the door open?

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,570
Oh, sorry, Nana.

104
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,170
Having you clean up all by yourself.
Let me help you.

105
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,840
It's okay. I just have to rinse.

106
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,240
Then give me a towel.
I'll wipe the dishes.

107
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,050
Yasu is a great guy.

108
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,830
He doesn't look it, but he's kind,
considerate, and reliable,

109
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,760
but doesn't brag.

110
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
And he's a lawyer too.

111
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,950
If I were to marry someone,
I'd prefer a guy like him.

112
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,830
What am I thinking?
Yasu belongs to Nana.

113
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,770
Come to think of it,
I have Shoji.

114
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,400
Oh, are you done?

115
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,110
Thanks for doing the dishes.
I'll be on my way.

116
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,710
Huh?

117
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,310
Thanks for the meal.

118
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,720
Where are you going?

119
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,180
I think I'll stay in a hotel
until I find my own place.

120
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,160
Shin's at Nobu's place so
it's kinda crowded there.

121
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,020
Why not stay here?

122
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,450
Right. Thank you.
But I'll hafta decline the offer.

123
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,760
There's no reason
you should hafta decline!

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,930
Yeah, but it wouldn't be right.
Good night.

125
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,560
Why?

126
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,440
I don't understand.

127
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,850
Although she was drunk,
Nana was being so sweet.

128
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,480
Why is Yasu always so stoic?

129
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,050
Could he have
a girlfriend back home?

130
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,420
Playing in a band and all,
he's probably popular with the women.

131
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,990
Still, even if he does have
a girlfriend back home

132
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,430
she can't be that important to him
since he left her to come here.

133
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,700
Shoji left me, too!

134
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,200
But it's not the same with Shoji.

135
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,380
He's treated me with
great care since long ago.

136
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,750
Besides, I'm here now because
he asked me to come.

137
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,790
I decided on my own to go after him
and come here!

138
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,660
Well, you eloped, didn't you?

139
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,320
Just don't get divorced
and come running home.

140
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,090
You're wrong, Mom.
I came here on my own.

141
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,290
Let's live together, Nana.

142
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,760
It's all right. It's all right.

143
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,530
Shoji said that to me.

144
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,200
If I wanted to marry,

145
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,960
he'd accept me as his bride anytime.

146
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,440
I wonder.

147
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,500
Living together and getting married
is somewhat different, I think.

148
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,410
Besides, Shoji just started
studying at the university,

149
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,240
so he won't graduate for
another four years.

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,410
And he's just as broke as I am.

151
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,090
A wedding is a major event,
so it's gonna cost money.

152
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,030
She's right. I'm not interested
in a cheap wedding.

153
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,390
I wanna wear a traditional
white wedding kimono.
She's right. I'm not interested
in a cheap wedding.

154
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,590
I wanna wear a traditional
white wedding kimono.
I've got to wear cute bridal wear.

155
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:12,830
I've got to wear cute bridal wear.

156
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,430
And a wedding dress.
I've got to wear cute bridal wear.

157
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,660
I don't wanna live in
low-income housing

158
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,630
or a one bedroom apartment.

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,320
If possible, a detached home with
a yard would be nice.

160
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,260
Or at least, a brand new condominium.

161
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,800
I hafta save money!

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,070
I'll try not to use the 300,000 yen
my mom sent me,

163
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,040
and keep it in my bank account.

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,670
And I'll save more on my own, too.

165
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,710
If I keep at it, I should have
saved up quite an amount

166
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,850
by the time Shoji graduates
from university.

167
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,450
Shoji!

168
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,350
I'll get that house with a yard, Shoji.
Leave it to me.

169
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,080
Fantasy running wild
I'll get that house with a yard, Shoji.
Leave it to me.

170
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,480
My head hurts!

171
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,020
Shit. I shouldn't have agreed
to work today.

172
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,530
Hachi! Medicine!

173
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,830
Hachi!

174
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,960
Aren't you home?!

175
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh, good morning, Nana.

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,670
What's with that outfit?

177
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,770
I have a job interview.

178
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,600
I gave them a call and
they told me to come right away.

179
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,300
How do I look? Will this do?

180
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,640
Work? What kind?

181
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,550
A publisher.

182
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,310
What?!

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,450
Are you all right?
Do you have a hangover, Nana?

184
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,250
I've got some medicine
that'll work for that.

185
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,580
A publisher?

186
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,130
Can someone like you get into
a place like that?

187
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,420
But I do meet their conditions
to apply.

188
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,730
The ad says they're looking for
someone who can do errands.

189
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,270
Besides, it's a small company
I've never heard of,

190
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,460
so I'm sure it'll be fine.

191
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,770
You sure about that?

192
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,670
I just hope this place isn't going
bankrupt anytime soon.

193
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,440
Let me get you some water.

194
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,700
"Let me get you," she says.

195
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,870
She's even changed her speech pattern
to match the outfit.

196
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,280
But why a publisher, suddenly?

197
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,050
I just happened to come across it
in the classifieds.

198
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,050
The salary's good and
I get two days off every week.

199
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,860
Also, since I'm living in Tokyo,

200
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,690
I'd like to commute to the downtown.

201
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,420
Doesn't working for a publisher
sound super cool?

202
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,060
It has the ring of a successful woman.

203
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,230
Ring of a successful woman?

204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,830
But I am glad you've decided
to look for your next job.

205
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,240
I thought you saying you wanted
to live on your own

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,940
was all talk and no action.

207
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,800
But now I see you were serious.

208
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,770
Well, not really.

209
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,670
The only reason I decided to work
is simply because I want money.

210
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,050
But regardless of what
my true intentions are,

211
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,760
if I get into a sound company
and work hard,

212
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,950
it'll eventually give me the skills
and ability to live on my own.

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,130
That's killing two birds
with one stone.

214
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,420
By the way, where's Yasu?

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,730
Yasu said he'll be staying at a hotel
until he finds a place to live, and left.

216
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,220
I tried to stop him, but...

217
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,570
Is that so.

218
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,760
"Is that so"?!

219
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,970
I'll be going now.

220
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,700
We'll be practicing at
the usual studio tonight.

221
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,980
Can you make it too, Hachi?

222
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,470
Mhm. I have no plans this evening.

223
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,580
Then come!

224
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,880
From tonight,
Yasu will be playing the drums,

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,180
so it's gonna be far better than anything
you've heard so far.

226
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,290
Sure!

227
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,020
That Nana.
She really is in a good mood.

228
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,360
Her good mood is rubbing off on me,
it's making me excited.

229
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,150
But yeah.

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,990
They now have all the band members
they need.

231
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,330
All they have to do now is head
towards their dreams full force.

232
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,560
All right! I'll do my best, too!

233
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,800
Shoji!

234
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,440
Hey, Junko! Long time no see.

235
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,980
Well, yeah. It's the first time
I've run into you on campus.

236
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,980
Are you coming to school like
you should?

237
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,260
That's not nice.
I am seriously attending classes.

238
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,020
Shoji. I'll go on ahead.
Should I cover for you?

239
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,600
Ah, sure. Well... no.

240
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,590
Which is it?!
Make up your mind, will ya?!

241
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,760
Use your wise judgment!

242
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,900
All right.

243
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,340
So is that the rumored Sachiko?

244
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,170
No! Ah, what's this about a rumor?!

245
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,110
What the hell?!
No! Ah, what's this about a rumor?!

246
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,870
No! Ah, what's this about a rumor?!

247
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,900
Wow. You're totally freaking out.

248
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
That makes you all
the more suspicious.

249
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,700
Give me a break!

250
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,350
That Kyosuke. Telling Junko,
of all people...

251
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,010
Let that guy speaking in
a Kansai dialect cover for you in class.

252
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,640
In the meantime, you will give me details.

253
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,490
Matsuda.

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,530
Have you seen Shoji today?
Is he not here?

255
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,890
No. We were together
until a moment ago.

256
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,590
But we bumped into a girl he knew.

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,560
They wanted to talk, so I left.

258
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,900
Oh?

259
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,860
It's not like that.
I doubt that was his girlfriend.

260
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,170
Don't worry.

261
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,070
Matsuda. I don't have
special feelings for Shoji.

262
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,770
We're just good friends.

263
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,610
What are you saying?
It's more than obvious.

264
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,180
You know, at first I thought
you two were dating.

265
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,990
I was really surprised when
I heard that Shoji has another girlfriend.

266
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,020
I didn't know either until recently.

267
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,190
To be honest I was a bit surprised.

268
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
What do you mean?!
Was he hiding it?!

269
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,830
He's the worst!

270
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,940
That's not it!

271
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,310
I assumed on my own that
he didn't have one!

272
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,500
Don't cover for him.
You're so sweet.

273
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Come on, have a seat, Sachiko.

274
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,810
Forget about Shoji and
go out with me.

275
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,050
Sorry, but I'm not attending this class.

276
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,080
Besides, you have a girlfriend back home,
don't you, Matsuda?

277
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,480
Shoji told me.

278
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,350
That guy. Going around disclosing
other people's secrets and not his.

279
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll get you for this, Shoji.

280
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,950
You really are the worst!

281
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,660
I have totally lost respect for you!

282
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,030
I just didn't get a chance
to talk about it.

283
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,700
I wasn't necessarily hiding it.

284
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,690
Don't make excuses!

285
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,900
You were planning on two-timing them,
weren't you?

286
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,770
Junko! Do you think I'm capable
of doing something like that?!

287
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,540
Of course not!

288
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,070
Yet you got greedy and ended up
breaking somebody's heart.

289
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,580
You think she's hurt.

290
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,670
Of course she's hurt!
Sachiko's in love with you, right?

291
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,780
But maybe I'm just hoping
that she is.

292
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,250
She hasn't actually told me
that she likes me.

293
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,290
And nothing has changed since.

294
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,060
We still continue seeing each other
as no more than friends.

295
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,760
Your intellectual level has remained
the same since junior high.

296
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,400
This is nonsense!

297
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,500
Junko!

298
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,660
Don't talk to me like that!

299
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,100
What should I do to make things right?!

300
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,040
You hafta put an end to this.

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,780
If you keep spending time with her,

302
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,010
you'll continue hurting her
until it becomes unbearable.

303
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,820
But we attend the same classes
and we work at the same workplace.

304
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,720
How am I to put an end to it?

305
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,190
Actually, before you
concern yourself with Sachiko,

306
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,520
shouldn't you be thinking
about Nana instead?

307
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Huh?

308
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,800
So Sachiko's more important
to you than Nana.

309
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,850
That's not true!

310
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,060
I haven't done anything that
needs explaining to Nana.

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,940
But Nana seems to suspect
you and Sachiko.

312
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,870
Huh?!

313
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,530
I heard her mumbling about Sachiko.

314
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,640
She said something about her working
for her Demon Lord or something.

315
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,110
Oh. You've got it wrong.
That's the virtual Sachiko.

316
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,450
Huh? What do you mean,
virtual Sachiko?

317
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,420
I have no idea.
In fact, I'd like to know.

318
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,580
You know, Shoji.

319
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,620
I can perfectly understand that
you're exhausted being with Nana,

320
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
and you look for comfort through Sachiko.

321
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,590
Comfort?!

322
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,820
That's it, Junko. That's exactly it.

323
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
I feel comfort whenever
I'm with Sachiko.

324
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,030
But you knew that Nana's
an exhausting woman in that way,

325
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,400
and still you went after her.

326
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,470
So don't run away now.
Stick with her diligently!

327
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,840
Of course, that's what I intend to do!

328
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm committed in this relationship
enough to make Nana my wife.

329
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,140
Eventually I wanna share
a grave with her.

330
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,480
You're taking this too far.

331
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,010
You'll never rest in peace

332
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,050
if you die with that believer
of the Demon Lord.

333
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,880
Junko! Whose side are you on?!

334
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,750
Neither, really.

335
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,720
You could say,
I'm on the side of justice.

336
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,120
What does she mean, justice!
She's making fun of me.

337
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,350
This coming from a former delinquent.

338
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,790
One day I'm gonna show everyone
pictures of you from junior high.

339
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,550
Why are you here?!

340
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,150
Shoji. Thank goodness.
I was looking for you.

341
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,890
Here's the book I borrowed.

342
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,590
I wanted to hurry and return it to you.

343
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,320
Thank you very much.

344
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,020
Ooh. Anytime would've been fine.

345
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,200
You could've even given it
to me at work.

346
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,420
You're right. I'm sorry.

347
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,330
No, there's no need to apologize.

348
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,970
So, how long have you
been standing here?

349
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,510
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to eavesdrop,

350
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,450
but given the content of
the conversation, I just froze.

351
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,840
Never mind that!
How long have you been here?!

352
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,840
Of course she's hurt!

353
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,940
Sachiko's in love with you, right?

354
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,260
Shoji! I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

355
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,060
Ahh, yeah. Just so we're clear,

356
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,460
I didn't stumble like that to try
and make you laugh or anything.

357
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm really sorry.

358
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,160
No, Sach... you don't hafta apologize.

359
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,870
I'm the one at fault.

360
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
I'm at fault! Bye!

361
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,040
This is bad. This is worse than bad.

362
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,310
What am I gonna do?

363
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,610
I hafta think this through seriously.

364
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,580
If you keep spending time with her,

365
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,880
you'll continue hurting her until
it becomes unbearable.

366
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,590
But it would be cowardly

367
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,710
to run away from it like this,
right, Koichi Sato?!

368
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,720
Huh?

369
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
Nothing. I'm talking to myself.

370
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,020
What do you mean?
After calling a person by his full name.

371
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,030
Besides, Shoji, I thought
you had class today.

372
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,960
If you're already cutting class

373
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,100
to come here
and drink at this early hour,

374
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,400
I'd say your future isn't looking
too good.

375
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,800
That's right.
What am I doing here at Jackson's?

376
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,260
I see. So this is what escaping
from one's troubles is like.

377
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,970
Then I'm already running away.

378
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,380
So Sachiko's more important
to you than Nana.

379
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,290
You're wrong!

380
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,050
Koichi Sato, I'm going to work!

381
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,590
I'm gonna break ties with her!

382
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,290
I do what I can to be buried
in the same grave with Nana!

383
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,240
Ever since I first met her,

384
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,640
I was planning not to hang out
with her much.

385
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,200
So what am I doing, feeling comforted
by her?

386
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,140
That's exactly what
the Demon Lord wants.

387
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,650
It won't happen.

388
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,890
I definitely won't betray Nana.

389
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,630
Why do you change into your sneakers,
Miss Kawamura?

390
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,340
Because I have to run
for the last train.

391
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,300
Right, that makes sense.

392
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,090
Sorry to keep you. Let's hurry.

393
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,050
Wait, Sachiko!

394
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,820
I have to talk to you about something.

395
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,730
Don't make such a face.

396
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,390
I won't look at her face.

397
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,530
I'll talk as we walk,
so will you please listen?

398
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,670
If we miss the last train,
I'll pay for a taxi.

399
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,460
So, how am I supposed to end this?

400
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,460
What am I to tell her? How?

401
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,990
She's my friend and
not my girlfriend to start with.

402
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,660
So asking her to break up with me
would be odd.

403
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,560
Do I say we're no longer friends?

404
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,460
But why should I have to say that?

405
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,700
Sachiko hasn't done anything wrong.

406
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,900
Or rather, she's a really great girl.

407
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,570
What am I doing?

408
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,410
Anyway, I must say something.

409
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,150
You know!

410
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,630
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

411
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,190
You've done nothing wrong, Shoji.

412
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,930
I jumped to conclusions on my own
and got carried away.

413
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,600
I will be careful not to interfere.

414
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,980
I will never interfere in your relationship
with your girlfriend.

415
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,850
So... please.
Can't we at least be friends?

416
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,060
Don't ask me to end this.

417
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,970
That's strange.

418
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,010
Huh?

419
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,010
Shoji should be done with work,

420
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,410
but I get his answering service.

421
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,310
I wonder if he forgot
to switch it on.

422
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,580
I want to hurry and tell him
that I got a new job.

423
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,420
He's probably cheating on you.

424
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,010
Shoji wouldn't do such a thing!

425
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
I'll send him an email.

426
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,820
I wonder what kinda company would hire
a woman like you?

427
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,100
They must really be understaffed.

428
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,130
But you know, I'll learn the job
while doing errands,

429
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,040
and if I am fully capable,
they'll hire me permanently.

430
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,890
So I'll do my best.

431
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,900
Wow. You seem awfully motivated.

432
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,980
If I work hard I will get
a bonus,

433
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,410
which will get me a step closer to buying
a detached house with a yard.

434
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,450
A detached house with a yard?
Is that your dream?

435
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,280
Yup! A great big dream!

436
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,110
Then I'll build you a home
with the money I get from my songs.

437
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,860
Huh?

438
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,300
But your room will be the doghouse.

439
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,370
If Nana was a guy, she would be
the love of my life.

440
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,970
Back then, I often thought that.

441
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,510
However, if that were the case,

442
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,010
I doubt we would've been
left with only happy memories.

443
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,920
Because love and pain go hand in hand.

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,690
The deeper you fall,
the more painful it gets.

445
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,820
I reached into the sky

446
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:19,340
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

447
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,710
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

448
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,710
Like colorful balloons

449
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm alone

450
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,550
My hand had no place to go

451
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,190
And gently you took it

452
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,360
Starless night

453
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,560
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

454
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,370
I want to feel your warmth

455
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,240
Tears are falling down

456
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,340
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

457
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:06,840
Of your hand holding mine
