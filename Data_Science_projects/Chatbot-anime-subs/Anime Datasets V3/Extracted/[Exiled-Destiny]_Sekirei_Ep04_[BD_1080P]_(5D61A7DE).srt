00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,130
You were here... weren't you?

2
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,950
Ku...

3
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,200
You're picking me up
with a black limousine?

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
How extravagant.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,530
I promised you.

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,500
It's better to be flashy if you can, isn't it?

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,870
We did cause a lot of
trouble for you in this case.

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,540
So you're aware of it.

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,880
How's number 108 doing?

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,050
She's stable.

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,880
She fell asleep right after dinner.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,890
She doesn't seem
to have had any troubles so far.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,560
Well, I guess I don't need to worry.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,900
There's a scary landlady there, after all.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,230
You don't ask about her Ashikabi.

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,570
I don't need to.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,560
I believe I know more
about him than anyone.

Just looking at the data, he's an
ordinary dull entrance exam loser...

Just looking at the data, he's an
ordinary dull entrance exam loser...

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,340
"Musubi"
Yet, he's already induced
two Sekireis to emerge.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,910
"Musubi"
"Kusano"
Yet, he's already induced
two Sekireis to emerge.

42
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,710
Yet, he's already induced
two Sekireis to emerge.

43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,440
I must say this is very interesting.

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,020
Well, I'm going now.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,690
Have a nice day.

46
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,030
Do your best at your work!

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,760
The abnormally growing plants
in the arboretum were completely
eliminated overnight by the MBI.

The elimination methods were

50

The elimination methods were
not made public at all but MBI

51
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
This...

52
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,050
Ku-chan?

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,310
What's wrong?

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,730
Ku-chan.

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,760
Are you all right?

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,740
Shii-chan...

57
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,570
"Shii-chan"?

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,250
Shii-chan was my older
friend and very close to me.

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,760
That tree told me...
Shii-chan took the plants I grew and...

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,250
That's... what the news
was just talking about.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,100
Shii-chan has the opposite power of mine.

62
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,430
Opposite?

63
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,770
What should I do?

64
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:42,440
Without Shii-chan,
I'll do the same thing again.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,380
Don't worry. I'm right here.

66
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,750
I'm not so dependable, though.

67
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,760
Please stay with me forever, big brother.

68
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,300
Ku is... crying.

69
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,940
A Sekirei opposite to Ku-chan, huh?

70
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,320
Oh, I know.

71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,980
Ah, Director?

72
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,820
Huh?

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,490
Doesn't Seo-san work today?

74
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,150
Seo?

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,830
He quit?!

76
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,770
He said his other job kept him too busy.
What an irresponsible guy!

77
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
Hey...

78
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,580
If you're scared so much like that,
why don't you watch TV inside?

79
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,530
Your steps aren't strong enough!

80
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,690
Right!

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Second one, eh?

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,400
That guy can't be judged
by his appearance...

83
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,880
He was the first other Ashikabi I met...

84
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,370
I had lots to ask him...

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,550
I'm back.

86
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,690
Yo, youngster!

87
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,390
Welcome back.

88
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,890
Welcome back, Minato-san.

89
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,560
Sorry, sorry. Did I surprise you?

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,890
Why?

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,900
He is...
Seo-san was my husband's best friend.

92
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,230
Well, that's how it goes.

93
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,240
He comes here only when
he doesn't have anything to eat.

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,910
Even though he's such trash,
he's still Takehito-san's best friend...

95
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,580
You're still as scary as before.

96
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,920
Ah... excuse me but...

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,580
Huh?

98
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,250
You look like you
knew I'm a resident here.

99
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,460
Yeah, it was your lunch.

100
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,720
Lunch?

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,690
You gave me some.

102
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,260
That was Miya-chan's taste.

103
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,600
By the way, how's that little girl doing?

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,570
Do you mean Ku-chan?

105
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, here she is!

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,270
Hey, come here.

107
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,280
Huh? I'm the nice guy who saved you.

108
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,840
If you don't listen to me,
I'll make you cry, you brat...

109
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Ah, my hand slipped.

110
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,290
You shouldn't bully such a little girl.

111
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,960
Ah, yes, I apologize...

112
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,930
Hello, excuse me!

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,430
Is that idiot over
here bothering you again?

114
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,670
Yo! Thank you for coming to get me.

115
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,980
- You again!
- You again! Bothering others!

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,450
Um... Seo-san.

117
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,320
Thank you very much for yesterday.

118
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,990
I've wanted to say that to you.

119
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,500
Don't worry about it.

120
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
When I look at you,
I can't leave you alone, you know?

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:23,800
"I handle any problems
and troubles. Kaoru Seo"
When I look at you,
I can't leave you alone, you know?

122
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,900
"I handle any problems
and troubles. Kaoru Seo"
Here.

123
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,190
Here.

124
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,000
You "handle any problems and troubles"?

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,340
I'll make a special deal for ya.

126
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,670
You charge money?!

127
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,350
We're friends now, after all.

128
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry he always does this...

129
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,420
What is with that person?

130
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,690
"I handle any problems
and troubles. Kaoru Seo"
What is with that person?

131
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,860
"I handle any problems
and troubles. Kaoru Seo"
As I've told you, he's a trashy human.

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,020
As I've told you, he's a trashy human.

133
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,220
Landlady...

134
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,370
I'm completely boiled.

135
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,040
It was you who told me you wanted to
compete on how long we can stay in the tub.

136
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,940
Give up, give up. Let's get out.

137
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,710
Come to think of it...

138
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,650
Your Ashikabi-sama...

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
That's a secret.

140
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,060
Aren't you lonely... Umm...
since you aren't with your Ashikabi-sama?

141
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,570
Of course, I'm lonely
and wish to be together.

142
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,740
But in my case, there are
some extenuating circumstances.

143
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,410
I'm happy just living under the same sky.

144
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,740
It's not bad having a
connection like that...

145
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,250
Uzume-san...

146
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,080
Well, each person's different,
and so is each Sekirei.

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,420
I see. Each one's different.

148
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes, yes.

149
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,660
There are 108 of us, after all.

150
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,040
"Toilet"

151
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,460
Ku-chan?

152
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,130
Gh-Gh-Gh...

153
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,800
A ghost?

154
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,140
Ah. So, that's why
Ku-chan was out of the bed.

155
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,140
I thought Sahashi-san had taken her out.

156
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,810
Landlady, what was with that little laugh?

157
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:59,490
So after that, we thought there might be
a burglar, and looked around the house.

158
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,720
But we couldn't find anybody.

159
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,160
It was a long-haired woman with glasses.

160
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,500
She was laughing...

161
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,170
Long-haired, glasses?

162
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,170
Ah, isn't that...

163
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,930
Uzume-san.

164
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,060
Eh, ah... I don't know.

165
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm quite sure Ku-chan was half asleep.

166
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,680
There couldn't be a ghost
here in Maison Izumo. Right?

167
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,080
Yes, you're exactly right...

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Are you going to visit a grave?

169
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes. Today is my late
husband's monthly death anniversary.

170
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,530
Your husband...

171
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,520
Now, please excuse me. Take care
of everything while I'm out, please.

172
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,210
What should we do for lunch?

173
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,210
Uzume-san, I'll cook lunch!

174
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,210
I'll help!

175
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,050
Really? I'll leave it to you, then.

176
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,220
Sure!

177
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,550
Okay then, you guys, come to my room!

178
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,180
Her room?

179
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,320
Just now... something was...

180
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,270
Ah! We're done.

181
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
Those outfits...

182
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,580
Do they look good on us, Minato-san?

183
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,250
Musubi-chan...

184
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,590
Oh no. When you dress like that,
you gotta say, "Master."

185
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,590
Uzume-san!

186
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,260
Master.

187
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,590
Yes.

188
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,030
Don't reply seriously...

189
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,940
Oh, Ku-chan's cute,
too. Is that... a wagtail?

190
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,610
But why do they have
to dress like this to prepare meals?

191
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,280
Now, I got to take a nap.
Wake me up when lunch's ready.

192
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,620
Why does she have those costumes?

193
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,520
Uzume-san... she's a mysterious person...

194
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,330
Sorry for making you wait.

195
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,870
Thank you for the meal!

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,970
Th-Thank you for the meal...

197
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,820
The more I look at him,
the more lame he looks...

198
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,760
Then... why is my maiden
heart skipping like this?

199
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,190
"JLTeito North Station"

200
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,830
It's really late now...

201
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,200
Hmm...

202
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,830
Ku...

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,780
Maison Izumo, huh?
It looks quite far away from the station...

204
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,610
Ouch!

205
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,860
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,360
Ah! His disheveled manner,
his eyes, his lips...

207
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Everything about him looks so fragile...

208
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,700
A pretty boy!

209
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,030
Did you get hurt?

210
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,040
No, um...

211
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,940
Gotcha!

212
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,380
Honestly, running from
place to place like that...

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,380
If I don't take you with me,
I'll be scolded by my master.

214
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,050
No!

215
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,720
I won't go to someone who bullied Ku!

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Geez! You're so stubborn!

217
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,680
Then, I'll make you feel a bit of pain!

218
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,490
What the hell are you guys doing?!

219
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,740
I don't know what's going on,
but don't worry. I will protect you!

220
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,070
Get away, you ordinary passerby!

221
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,910
No can do, stupid!
Pretty boys are national treasures!

222
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,080
This... uneasy feeling...

223
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
What an obnoxious woman!

224
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,980
I won't go easy on you!

225
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,450
Let's run!

226
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,310
I won't let you run away!

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,590
Could she be?!

228
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,120
Just now, I know I...

229
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Something's here.

230
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,450
I should go ask Uzume-san after all...

231
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,790
I'm done with cleaning.

232
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,130
You're really working hard.

233
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,290
It's fun to take care of the house.

234
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,960
Where is Uzume-san?

235
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,800
She's been sleeping with
Ku-chan ever since she ate lunch.

236
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,140
Uzume-san seems like
she's sleeping all the time.

237
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,810
I heard her operational
time limit is four hours per day.

238
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,210
Is that a characteristic of Sekireis?

239
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,270
I don't know. We're all different.

240
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,160
MBI's choppers!

241
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,530
What should we do?! We destroyed
a bunch of stuff at the entrance.

242
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,300
They must've come to retrieve her.

243
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
Eh?! Retrieve?

244
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,170
Sekireis who've lost the Sekirei symbols
can no longer stay with their Ashikabi-sama.

245
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,910
Hey, Musubi-chan?

246
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,840
Yes?

247
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Tell me about what you said in the arboretum...

248
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,690
"Sekireis who've lost can no
longer be with their Ashikabis."

249
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:14,760
Will you... if you lose, will you
disappear from in front of me like her?

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,700
Yes, I will.

251
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,570
For those who alight on earth as Sekireis,

252
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,600
that's the unchangeable
and absolute destiny.

253
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
That's right...

254
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,050
The President of MBI was
also saying that from the first.

255
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,550
That this was a game
called the Sekirei Plan.

256
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,050
It's just rational...

257
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,650
Since it's a game, it'll be all
finished when it's time for a game-over.

258
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,550
You're wrong!

259
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,370
It's not a game.

260
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:09,920
My feelings...
My feelings toward you are not a game!

261
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I want to be beside you forever.

262
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Musubi-chan.

263
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,930
So, I!

264
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,160
So, I will never lose! No, I won't!

265
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,270
Also, there's a reward for us Sekireis.

266
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:43,620
The last remaining Sekirei can stay
with its most beloved person forever.

267
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,950
So, please don't worry.

268
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,620
Until that day, I will never lose.

269
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,960
You mean...

270
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm home.

271
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,730
Landlady! Welcome back!

272
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,750
Musubi-chan!

273
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,540
She got so close to him!

274
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,970
What? Could this be?

275
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,310
My Sekirei symbol feels like it's burning.

276
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,310
The secrets of Sekireis'
hearts and bodies...

277
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,320
There's nothing I can do but
solve the mystery with my own body.

278
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,660
Musubi-san, would you please
go do a little shopping for me?

279
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Yes, Landlady.

280
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
Now then...

281
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,760
Number 88, Musubi...
You're my enemy, now.

282
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,800
Better prepare yourself.

283
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,180
Um... I got soy sauce and miso...

284
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,950
Then carrots, daikon radish, and cabbage...

285
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,340
"Please don't worry," huh?

286
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,810
Yes?

287
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,050
Sahashi-san, go take a bath.

288
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,450
Ah, yes. Thank you.

289
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,850
Ku-chan, you'll take a bath with me, later.

290
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,050
Yeah!

291
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,060
Say, Musubi-chan's late.

292
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,730
She really is.

293
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,800
But there's no need to worry about her.

294
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,890
I don't train her like hell
every day for nothing.

295
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,410
The military satellite made by
MBI is as good as you'd expect.

296
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,840
I think I can stop her for a while with this.

297
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,440
The main event starts right now.

298
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,280
So... I wonder what the
thing Ku-chan saw was?

299
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,430
Who is it?

300
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,190
Musubi-chan?

301
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,440
I told you, you don't
need to wash my back...

302
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,270
Huh?! Who are you?!

303
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:25,780
Grabbed a pretty boy, and ran and ran.
Took a train, then ran and ran, again...

304
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,940
What should I do now?
I brought him to my room!

305
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,020
Whoa! Wait! Who are you?

306
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,760
What's going on?

307
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

308
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is renai no shinansho

309
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, aserazu so

310
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without furaingu de show time

311
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,280
Get the funky beat!

312
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,820
Hayai mono gachi?

313
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090

Dear Sweet Heart!

334
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,890
I am number 09, Tsukiumi.

335
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,560
I don't need Ashikabi.

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Why is that?

337
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,570
How could I do this
and that with a human?!

338
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,570
Doing this and that is easy!

339
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,570
Dost thou understand thy words?

340
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,770
No, I don't at all.

No, I don't at all.
