1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,030
What name do I give that feeling
that was born that night?

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,870
Sweet words like "love" or " adore"
just don't sound right.

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,080
Perhaps envy and irritation
mixed in with jealousy.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,910
And moreover, desire.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,760
Even now I get anxious.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,230
Because sometimes I feel
that this daily life,

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,990
living together with Ren,
is nothing but a dream.

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,930
Ren was a bright light that lightened
the boring life I lived until then.

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,340
But no matter how hard I try,
he still remains outta my reach.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,480
Nana...

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,150
I'm going to Tokyo.

12
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,690
You live your life however you like.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,200
When I was darkness at that time

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,030
With trembling lips

15
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,130
In a corner of a room I cry

16
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,210
The more I struggle

17
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,040
The more this wound deepens

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,210
The broken promise hurt me

19
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,940
Nobody can save me

20
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,120
God, I have only one request

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,750
Stop tearing apart my love

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,100
I need your love

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,330
I'm a broken rose

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,270
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

25
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,440
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,210
I need your love

27
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,510
I'm a broken rose

28
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,450
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,410
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

30
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,380
I wanna need your love

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,620
I'm a broken rose

32
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,950
I wanna need your love

33
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,470
Tokyo?

34
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,640
Whaddaya mean, Yasu?
Are you quitting university?

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,420
I thought you were going
to be a lawyer.

36
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,940
No, not me. Ren.

37
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,820
Remember that band Ren
and I used to do gigs with

38
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,850
when we had our old band,
Trapnest?

39
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,630
Trap? Oh Trapnest!

40
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,730
They had the most awesome
female vocalist!

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,660
Yeah, we got along real well.
Used to go out drinking and stuff.

42
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,510
Well, about two years ago I guess,

43
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,940
the whole bunch of 'em went up
to Tokyo looking to become pros.

44
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,540
Looks like they got a contract.

45
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,040
No kidding! That's great!
I gotta say, they were good, though.

46
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,120
But that contract... their debut...

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,350
apparently there were problems
and the guitarist quit.

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,690
So the whole band got together
and decided to call on Ren.

49
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,230
Ren's in Tokyo meeting producers
this morning,

50
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,100
but they've already approved
his guitar recordings,

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,800
so it's just like a get-together.

52
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,100
He's a member of the band, man.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,630
Hey wait a minute...

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,640
It's not like he's moved there yet.

55
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,540
He'll be back in town tomorrow.

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,240
But he's moving to Tokyo, right?!
What about Blast?!

57
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,890
What's going to happen to us?

58
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,090
We've only been together
for a year and a half.

59
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,520
We're just getting into the groove...

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't worry.

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,750
You can find bass players
a dime a dozen.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,860
We'll find a replacement
right away.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,730
That's easy to say,
but I don't buy it.

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,640
I feel like I've been double-crossed.

65
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,510
Hey man, Ren's been sitting around
in town going nowhere.

66
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,940
Don't you think it's a waste?

67
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,720
Well then, why don't we all
go to Tokyo with Ren

68
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,150
and venture into
our professional career?!

69
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,250
Tokyo, look out for Blast!

70
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,490
Sorry, but I have no intention of
making a living in music.

71
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,360
I don't want to gamble
my life away like that.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,700
Besides, if Ren goes to Tokyo,
he should be playing with Trapnest.

73
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,270
Why?!

74
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,360
There's no guarantee that
we'll be able to get a contract anyway.

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,230
We can give it a try!

76
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,580
Hey, no matter how hard you try,

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,510
there're still a million out there
who don't have the luck to make it.

78
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,340
I don't want Ren to be one of them.

79
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,080
Luck is moving in his favor.

80
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,110
He's gotta make it,
no matter what it takes.

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,980
It's not like just because Trapnest
got a contract that they'll sell...

82
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,760
No worries, man.
That band will sell.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,260
Their sound and their looks shine.

84
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,530
You put Ren in there?
It's a done deal.

85
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,890
But!

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Get over yourself!

87
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,330
If you want to go to Tokyo,
then go!

88
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,400
But don't get in Ren's way!

89
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,940
Besides, you're taking
after your dad's Terashima Inn!

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,180
That's probably why
you're so carefree about this all.

91
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,700
You don't have to worry
about a future.

92
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,120
Get over your sweet dreams
about becoming professional

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
and work for your dad.

94
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,420
Being in a band is playtime.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,880
Yeah maybe, but...
I'm worried about Nana.

96
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,420
Is Ren going to, like,
dump her and take off?

97
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,760
That's a screwed way of putting it.

98
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,500
Well then, he should take her
with him!

99
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,900
What's that attitude?
Dump her or take her.

100
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,140
Nana is not some cat
that belongs to Ren.

101
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,810
You know as much as I do that
she's an independent woman.

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,980
She'll go with him if she wants to.

103
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,940
That's something for Nana to decide.

104
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm sure that's how Ren thinks, too.

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,650
Yasu...

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,220
You're really mature.

107
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,760
You're the brat.

108
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,560
But I guess if Nana decides
to go to Tokyo...

109
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,230
that's the end of Blast.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,000
When that time comes, I'm out.
Although I am going to miss this.

111
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,540
Time to get out.

112
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,840
You go and find another band
to be friendly with, Nobu.

113
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,090
When I met Ren the second time,

114
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,830
it was mid-summer afternoon,

115
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,560
when the ocean breeze
was biting my skin.

116
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,090
Hey Nobu, wanna join our band?

117
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,240
Why? What about the band
you got now?

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,460
We're breaking up.

119
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,640
Those guys are hopeless.
They don't put their heart in it.

120
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,970
They don't practice,
yet keep on complaining.

121
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,420
Hey, I heard that
when you were in middle school

122
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,250
you used to play guitar
in the school band,

123
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,390
and Ren used to talk about
how good you were,

124
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,450
that it would be
a total waste if you quit.

125
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,310
Huh?

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,620
I can play bass too,
so why don't you play guitar?

127
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,420
I'll do it!

128
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,530
Ah, but can we use a guy that's been
out of practice for a year and a half.

129
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
No problem, Ren!

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,270
I still practice at home every day
and I know all of your stuff!

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,540
I've lately started writing my own, too.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,900
Well then, it's a go.

133
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,680
So who's gonna do the vocals?

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,110
That's the problem.
Preferably a girl.

135
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,820
I'm sick and tired of those dud guys.

136
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,860
I hear ya. If she can sing at par,
I'd prefer a woman myself.

137
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,960
Nobu! A woman!
Go find a woman

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,530
A pretty one at that.

139
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,590
So what am I? A gofer already?
You got pretty women all around you!

140
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,190
Give me a break.

141
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,360
Try bringing in a woman
that I've done it with.

142
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,940
They'd only mean trouble.

143
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,500
If there's love, it should be all right.

144
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,670
Love, he says.

145
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,920
Those who laugh at love,
cry for love.

146
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,650
Nobuo, there's a friend here
to see you!

147
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,210
Miss Osaki! Can I let her in?!

148
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,120
Yeah, sure! Bring her through!

149
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
Osaki?

150
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,450
A girl?!

151
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,420
Is she pretty?

152
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,460
What? Yeah, but you've met her before.

153
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,900
Nana.

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,150
Nobuo, here's the CDIborrowed.
Thanks.

155
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,140
Thanks.

156
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,280
Well, see ya.

157
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,870
Huh?

158
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,520
Hey, Nana!

159
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,550
Nobu, have you two ever
gone out for karaoke?

160
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,380
Huh?

161
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,010
Is she good?

162
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, yeah. Average, I guess.

163
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,890
Then it's decided.

164
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,510
From that day on,
I have witnessed the surf,

165
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,560
pulled by Ren's gravity.

166
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,340
The waves rush with
the sound of my heart.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Higher, higher, higher.

168
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,260
Nana, sing in my band.

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,010
My feelings overflow
and become my voice.

170
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,790
But I haven't yet made it my choice,
to sing for Ren.

171
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,560
I sing for myself...

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
as I always have.

173
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,750
Certificate of Graduation
Nobuo Terashima

174
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,320
Certificate of Graduation
Nobuo Terashima
How's that? Make you jealous?

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,750
How's that? Make you jealous?

176
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Look. I sold all the buttons
on my uniform.

177
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,960
You gotta give it to the guitarist
that played for Blast.

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,590
How much do you think I got
for the second button?

179
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,670
I can't believe
you took money for it.

180
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,060
Get outta here, shrimp.
I'm busy.

181
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,870
You're lying.
This shop has no customers.

182
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,560
How are you busy?

183
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,270
I'm busy reading!

184
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,280
Why don't you pick up
a real book for a change,

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,750
instead of reading comics all the time?

186
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,080
I heard about Ren.
What are you gonna do?

187
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,450
Of course, you're going
to Tokyo with him, right?

188
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,020
Aha, so you've come to stop me.

189
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
You gonna miss me?

190
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,660
Go! Go to Tokyo! I'll come too!

191
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,630
What are you saying?

192
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,900
We'll find new members in Tokyo
and see how far we can get!

193
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,280
I realize it's not
that simple to go pro,

194
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,110
but I think it's worth a try!

195
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,110
I think your singing is all right!

196
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,420
Not that you're super good
or anything,

197
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,680
but you have a cool husky voice
and I feel like taking a chance on it!

198
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,660
I don't wanna play for anyone else.

199
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,120
That's probably how Yasu feels too.

200
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,570
That's why he's ready
to give it all up if you go.

201
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,300
Why is it you telling me this?

202
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,090
Huh?

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,170
I wanted to hear those words from Ren.
Not you...

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,180
Thanks Nobu, but...
I'm not going.

205
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,420
Why not? Can you handle
being separated from Ren?

206
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,150
Even if you can't be in the same band
you can at least live together!

207
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,920
No, I can't do that!

208
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,830
It'll be all right, Nana.

209
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,870
If you go with him,

210
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,660
he's not going to think of you
as an obstacle.

211
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,940
That guy, who thinks
he's God's gift to women,

212
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,270
hasn't fooled around on you once.

213
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,810
That's proof that he loves you.

214
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,500
I know that.

215
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,110
At least as long as you know.

216
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,910
However! Making love with Ren
is not the only thing I live for!

217
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,150
I, too, want to sing for a living.

218
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,590
So let's go to Tokyo!

219
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,080
Not now.

220
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,630
Why's that?!

221
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,460
Man, I don't understand you!

222
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,460
If I go now, I'll end up living
with Ren again.

223
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,760
I can't live without him.

224
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,710
So why don't you?

225
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,880
If I do, Ren's gonna be
making it big time

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,710
in a band with a female vocalist
that has a super voice,

227
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,780
while I sit around waiting for my break
which may never happen,

228
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,910
making miso soup and
waiting for Ren to come home.

229
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,820
No thanks, man.

230
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,920
That is totally degrading.

231
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,600
So I gotta get better first.

232
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,900
Give myself the confidence that

233
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,960
I can make it singing
without Ren's help.

234
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,660
One day for sure,

235
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,310
I'm going to Tokyo,
even if I go alone.

236
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,410
So bear with me, Nobu.
Stick around with me here for awhile.

237
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,620
You don't wanna sing
to another guy's guitar?

238
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,980
I don't care.

239
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,790
You don't wanna sing...

240
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,720
I don't care.

241
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,900
Ren and I fell in love exactly
a year after we met,

242
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,340
on Christmas night.

243
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,670
We were still feeling the excitement
from our concert.

244
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,140
On the way home from
the party afterwards...

245
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,550
we frolicked playfully,
kidding around like little kids,

246
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,040
on the snow-covered sea wall.

247
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,380
Hey! Far out! A homemade cake!
Am I ever popular. I'm eating it.

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,850
There might be poison in that.

249
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,120
Actually it's from a fan of mine.

250
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,660
It's the "you're making it with Ren
so now you must die" cake.

251
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,360
Then you taste it first.

252
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm not about to be killed
for something I didn't do.

253
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,330
No way, man.

254
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,940
It was so sudden
I forgot to close my eyes.

255
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,480
Now that we're guilty,
maybe I wouldn't mind getting killed.

256
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,290
I seriously thought
I wouldn't mind dying.

257
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Because I longed for Ren.

258
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,830
I wanted him so badly...

259
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,380
always, from that day on.

260
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,950
I thought no one was supposed
to lay a hand on Nana,

261
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,390
because that would only
cause problems in the band.

262
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,760
No worries. There's love. Right here.

263
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,250
You gotta be kidding me.

264
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,570
We didn't waste any time
moving in together.

265
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,370
Ren Honjo
Nana Osaki
We didn't waste any time
moving in together.

266
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,630
Ren Honjo
Nana Osaki

267
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,310
Ren showed me the joy of singing.

268
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,980
He taught me how to play the guitar.

269
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,420
He gave me the desire to live.

270
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,820
But what have I been able
to do for him?

271
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,870
Even if it means
I would not sing anymore,

272
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,500
I could go to Tokyo with Ren and
at least cook for him every day...

273
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,680
polish the apartment,
and have his child...

274
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,480
Maybe that's what I should do.

275
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,220
After all, that's plenty happiness in itself.

276
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,030
For those of us who
have no family,

277
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,470
the most important thing...

278
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,760
more than making
some dream come true...

279
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
has got to be making a home.

280
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,870
Is that all ya got?

281
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,510
Yep. Just give me my guitar and
some cigarettes and I'm happy.

282
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
He's lying.
He sent all his stuff ahead.

283
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,170
Says he doesn't like
carrying heavy stuff.

284
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,480
From now on, you won't have guys
below you to carry your stuff for you.

285
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,130
I can already see what
Ren's poor assistant

286
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,560
is going to have to suffer through.

287
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,390
I guess it's about time.

288
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,850
A year and three months
of living with Ren.

289
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,420
In the beginning of spring
before the snow completely melted away,

290
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,550
our story ended.

291
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,660
We didn't say goodbye.

292
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:09,540
But living apart would be
the end of us and we knew that.

293
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,880
Phone calls and letters are worthless.

294
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,610
It doesn't mean a thing if you can't
be there to hold each other in your arms.

295
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,050
Each night, I could feel
his sadness within me...

296
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,960
as he spilled it out without words.

297
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,820
I felt it deeper than anyone else
could ever do.

298
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
Merry Christmas! We're Blast.

299
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,970
At times, I still regret
what happened.

300
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,880
I sometimes feel that this everyday life
without Ren is all part of a dream.

301
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,650
Especially on these nights
when the snow falls heavily.

302
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,130
On a cold night like tonight,
someone, please keep him warm.

303
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,940
Nana, I bought the CD you released.
It's the greatest!
Your songs give me courage
to get through the day.
Your lyrics touch me deep inside.
I hope more and more people
will listen to your songs.

304
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,050
I'd be lonely if
you became famous, Nana.
Because look at Ren.
He's super popular now.
I'm happy for him,
but I have mixed feelings.
But I forgive him because he's cool.

305
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,040
Do you still keep in touch with Ren?
Say hi to him for me.
Best wishes. I'm rooting for you. AKIKO
P.S. I love your latest hairstyle.
It's so grown up. Maybe I'll do the same.

306
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,350
To Nana
From Misato

307
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,320
It's sweet.

308
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,290
It's been a year and nine months
since Ren and I separated.

309
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,770
Soon, the second spring will come.

310
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,080
In March, on my twentieth birthday,

311
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,810
I'm going to go out and buy me a present,
to congratulate myself for hanging on.

312
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,480
A one way ticket to Tokyo.

313
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,620
Just give me my guitar and
some cigarettes, and I'm happy.

314
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,820
I reached into the sky

315
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:19,340
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

316
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,710
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

317
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,710
Like colorful balloons

318
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm alone

319
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,550
My hand had no place to go

320
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,190
And gently you took it

321
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,360
Starless night

322
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,560
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

323
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,370
I want to feel your warmth

324
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,240
Tears are falling down

325
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,340
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

326
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:06,840
Of your hand holding mine
