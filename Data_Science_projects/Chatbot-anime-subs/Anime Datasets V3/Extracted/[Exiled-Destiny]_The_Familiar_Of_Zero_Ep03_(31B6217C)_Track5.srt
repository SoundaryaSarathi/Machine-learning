1
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,699
Man, it's cold...

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,677
Dammit, this is needlessly lacy.
It's so hard to wash.

3
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,574
Damn that conceited girl!

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,620
What is this?

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,555
It's the laundry that piled up

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,683
while you were bedridden after
doing something very stupid.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,660
All this?!

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,093
Of course.

9
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,564
You know...

10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,598
What?

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,935
I heard from Siesta that,
while I was hurt,

12
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,738
you looked over me
without sleeping, Louise.

13
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,872
So?

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,608
Well, now that I can,
I'd like to say thanks.

15
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,044
Thanks? Don't you have
the wrong idea?

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,984
A master takes good care of her
familiar as a matter of course.

17
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,086
In the first place, a familiar
should always have

18
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,355
a feeling of thanks
towards his master, no?

19
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,956
So saying thanks again...

20
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,187
You really aren't aware of your
situation as a familiar at all.

21
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:04,294
Stop with the stupidity,
hurry up and go work!

22
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:11,872
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

23
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:20,541
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

24
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,917
The sky where two moons
never fade away

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,996
That's an impossibility, right?

26
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:43,771
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

27
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:49,710
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,013
Even if you trip and
become depressed

29
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:03,612
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

30
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:10,330
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,670
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

32
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,776
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

33
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:31,115
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

34
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,615
Feverish Temptation

35
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,365
I'm in the same boat
as all of those things.

36
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,769
I wonder when I'll be
able to get back?

37
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,376
How much longer are you
going to spend on laundry,

38
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,879
instead of escorting me to class?!

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,481
You really are useless!

40
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,882
Let go! Ouch!

41
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,885
When the laundry is hung up,
come to the classroom immediately!

42
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,019
Got that?!

43
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,179
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,795
Fire, Water, Earth,
and Air magic create

45
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,925
a different, stronger effect by
combining multiple elements.

46
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,902
Furthermore, the level of
we mages is determined

47
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,371
by how many elements
we can combine.

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,806
What are those levels?

49
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,840
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,772
Go ahead.

51
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,245
Two elements combined form a Line,

52
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,813
three elements form a Triangle,

53
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,882
and four elements form a Square.

54
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,814
Well done.

55
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,346
Just a bit more...

56
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:49,229
I believe most of you can only
deal with one element at a time.

57
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,765
Mrs. Chevreuse, I hate to say this,

58
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,967
but a student that can't
even use one element,

59
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,334
with a zero percentage rate of
magical success, is among us.

60
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,843
In any case, all of you

61
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,311
Oh, I get it.
Should aim for a higher...

62
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:04,709
Oh, I get it.

63
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:10,348
I finally understood why all the
others call you Louise the Zero.

64
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,220
I see. A strange, but correct,
way of putting it.

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,314
Zero elements,
zero success rate of magic.

66
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,521
But you're still a noble!
How wonderful!

67
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,957
O Master, this humble familiar
has created a song.

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,570
Try singing it...

69
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,138
Yes, as you wish!

70
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,208
Lou-Lou-Louise is no-good Louise,

71
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,511
a sorcerer that can't cast any spells!

72
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,345
But it's all right!
Louise the Zero is still a girl!

73
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,151
Here...

74
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:44,785
Here?
Here...

75
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,052
Here?

76
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,787
Here... This familiar...

77
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,245
What are you saying to your master?!

78
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,055
Um... Did I make you angry?

79
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,462
Or more like, furious?

80
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,431
One meal taken away for
each Zero you just said!

81
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm sorry, I overdid it!

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,802
I won't say it anymore.
Anything but that!

83
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,270
No! Absolutely not!

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,795
I will make absolutely no exceptions!

85
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,844
Well...

86
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,211
Impossible.
Well...

87
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,179
Impossible.

88
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,481
I haven't said anything yet.

89
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,117
Lunch and dinner...
It's been only two.

90
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,914
You still have two more meals to skip.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,355
You're counting?

92
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,413
Nightgown.

93
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,831
And what are you going to do
if I starve to death?

94
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,467
Isn't it the master's responsibility
to take care of her familiar?

95
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:37,871
Huh? What about it? Hey, master?

96
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,072
Hey! Come on!

97
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,975
Gross! Don't spit on me!

98
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,809
Fine! I'll make an exception
just this once and forgive you!

99
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,447
Really?

100
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,183
Oh, what a kind master you are!

101
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,585
I won't say Zero anymore!

102
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,321
Even if your magic is zero,
or your breast size is zero,

103
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,023
no, I will never say so!

104
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,157
My breasts?!

105
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,258
What was that?!

106
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,225
Oh, crap!

107
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,462
No meals after all!

108
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,828
Plus no sleeping in the room tonight!

109
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,860
I think I'll freeze to death
before I starve to death.

110
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,103
So cold... So hungry...

111
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,940
Mr. Saito?

112
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,050
I'm sorry they're leftovers,

113
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,019
but eat as much as you want,
Our Sword!

114
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,389
Our Sword?

115
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,893
That's right. You're a peasant like us,

116
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,629
but you won the duel against
that snobby noble boy.

117
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,462
You're the pride of the
peasants, Our Sword!

118
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,368
When I held that sword,
my body just moved on its own,

119
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,036
so I have no idea what was going on.

120
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,037
Did you hear that?

121
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,274
A true master is like this,
never boasting!

122
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,869
This is where he's different
from all those stupid nobles!

123
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,679
I expected nothing less!

124
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,247
Nothing less!

125
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,343
But do they always eat stuff
this tasty? Damn...

126
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,289
When it comes to me,
Marteau the head chef,

127
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,959
anything will end up tasting exquisite!

128
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,228
This is magic in and of itself.

129
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,459
You're right! I've never had
stew this tasty before!

130
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,336
A good man! Saito, you
really are a good man!

131
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,138
I like you, Our Sword!

132
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,971
Please, let me kiss you!

133
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,671
I'll hold off from being
called that, and the kiss!

134
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,108
Such modesty. As expected!

135
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,110
As expected!

136
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,129
Please come again.

137
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,154
Every one of them is a fan
of yours, Mr. Saito.

138
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,969
Thanks to this, I'm now confident
that I can survive here.

139
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,271
Though when I got injured
the other day,

140
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,035
I thought that I was going to die.

141
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,278
Mr. Saito, you really were
in a dangerous situation,

142
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,939
one step shy of a coma.

143
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,149
Is that so?

144
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:08,054
You only revived after Miss Vallière
ordered a terribly expensive elixir.

145
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,720
As a noble, she sure has
money to spend.

146
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,028
Um, Mr. Saito?

147
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,496
I would like to have a long chat
with you sometime.

148
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,469
Is something the matter?

149
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,571
Uh, no... Someday later.

150
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,572
Yes.

151
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,541
Well, I think it's about time
for me to head back.

152
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,667
Good night.

153
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,141
Night!

154
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,634
She's such a good girl!

155
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,481
What?!

156
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,675
You're Kirche's...

157
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,121
If you eat something like me,

158
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,456
you're sure to have an upset stomach!

159
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,491
Is it all right? It won't be my fault!

160
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,220
Hey, are you listening?

161
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,130
This is...

162
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,994
Welcome.

163
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,488
Kirche?

164
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,104
Welcome to my suite, Hiragasa Ito.

165
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,440
Oh, was it Hira Gasaito?

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,310
If you don't mind, just call me Saito.

167
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,644
All right.

168
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,702
Saito...

169
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,815
I know that it's something
that shouldn't be.

170
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,151
But my byname is Fever.

171
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,054
I tend to burn like a torch.

172
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,318
Uh, I see.

173
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,559
You still don't understand?

174
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,494
I'm in love with you!

175
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,732
Love always comes so suddenly.

176
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,501
It's certainly sudden.

177
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:31,872
You looked so handsome
when you defeated Guiche!

178
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:37,071
Seeing it, Kirche the Fever
became Kirche the Passion...

179
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,145
Um...

180
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,112
Kirche!

181
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,249
Oh, my, Styx?

182
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,819
I came by because you didn't
show up at our promised time.

183
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,554
Then change that appointment
to two hours from now.

184
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,889
That's not the deal we had!

185
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,789
This is the third floor, right?

186
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,631
That was...

187
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,165
Just a friend.

188
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,532
Right now, the one that
I love the most is...

189
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,468
Kirche!

190
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,406
Who is that man?!

191
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,101
Tonight, I want you
to burn up with me...

192
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,610
That was another friend?

193
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,745
That's right.

194
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,813
In any case, the night is short,

195
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,646
and I don't want to waste
any time with you!

196
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,785
Kirche!

197
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,922
What are you doing?! You said you
didn't have any particular lover!

198
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,257
Manica... Ajax... Gimly!

199
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,126
Well then, in six hours.

200
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,491
That's morning already!

201
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,262
Flame!

202
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,187
Come on...

203
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,174
I love you, Saito!

204
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,877
Um, I have an errand to run.

205
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:48,381
You know, I'm just a familiar,
so I'm really busy. It's true.

206
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:53,286
Leave them be. I'm much more
than Louise the Zero.

207
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,686
She's right, those aren't a zero...

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh?

209
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,361
Louise?
Oh?

210
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:01,628
Louise?
Kirche!

211
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,529
Kirche!

212
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,197
I'm busy right now, Vallière.

213
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,667
Zerbst! Whose familiar
are you trying to seduce?!

214
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,536
It can't be helped.

215
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,572
Love and fire are the destinies
of the von Zerbst family.

216
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,234
I only wish to burn in flames of love.

217
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,710
Come here.

218
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,946
Wait! He may be your familiar,

219
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,715
but he is a proper human!

220
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,684
It's rather unreasonable to get in
the way of someone's romance!

221
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,354
Right, Saito?

222
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,223
That's right! It's unreasonable!

223
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,190
I see...

224
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,395
But you know, when
tomorrow comes,

225
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,762
you'll be skewered by
at least ten noblemen.

226
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,204
In the end, this is dangerous,
in all sorts of ways.

227
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,365
I'll say it one more time. Come here.

228
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,299
Oh, you're going home already?

229
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,215
Cute!

230
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,282
Ouch!

231
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,219
It's just her usual trick!
Wake up already!

232
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,222
Ouch... Don't pull so hard, I hear you!

233
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,490
You're going to tear my ear off!

234
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,219
I'm not going to give up just yet.

235
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,895
You're just like a dog in heat!

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,304
Sorry!

237
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,476
What is that?

238
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,014
A crop I use for horseback riding.

239
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,349
Crop?

240
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,684
I was wrong...

241
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,319
For accidentally treating you
like a human!

242
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,387
Liar!

243
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:38,825
To think you were wagging your tail
at a Zerbst, of all people!

244
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,292
Dog!

245
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,328
Young Miss!

246
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,464
Please, find it in your heart to drop...

247
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,565
I was spoiling you.

248
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,432
If you're a stray dog, I have
to treat you like a stray dog!

249
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,262
Wait... First, calm down...

250
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,542
Seriously, stop! Please!

251
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,272
What! What part of
that woman is so good?!

252
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,947
Let go of me, fool!

253
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,312
Can it be that you...

254
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,885
Because I was doing that
kind of stuff with Kirche,

255
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,819
instead of sneaking into your bed...

256
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,479
You were jealous?

257
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,698
Me? You? What was that?

258
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,735
No, it was just a misunderstanding...

259
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,705
I don't care who you date,
but she alone I forbid.

260
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:26,673
Alone?

261
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,308
Kirche's family, the Zerbsts,

262
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,611
and my family, the Vallières,
have long been archrivals!

263
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,613
It is a disgrace to my family
if one thread,

264
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:38,318
one dog, gets taken by
a Zerbst woman! Got that?!

265
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,479
Yeah... Kinda...

266
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,392
You were dragged to Kirche's room
in the salamander's mouth?

267
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,828
Yeah. It was involuntary!

268
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,898
How pathetic. You're
a swordsman, aren't you?

269
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:52,766
Who is?

270
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,335
The other day was the first time
I've ever held a sword in my life.

271
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,035
You're kidding!

272
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,372
I mean, you were so adept when
you were fighting against Guiche.

273
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,607
I don't know...

274
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,337
My body moved on its own the
moment I grabbed that sword.

275
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:10,416
Sometimes familiars can yield
special powers once contracted.

276
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,586
For instance, a black cat familiar
can learn to speak.

277
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,988
I'm no cat!

278
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,690
And anyway, you can't be
a swordsman when you're unarmed!

279
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,858
You're right.

280
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,361
And tomorrow, the day of
the week is Void-day...

281
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,395
How's that?

282
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,387
Anyway, hurry up and go to sleep!
We're getting up early tomorrow!

283
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,868
What's up with all that?

284
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,538
Where are you going?

285
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,972
Where? To the hallway.

286
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,974
It's all right. Sleep in the room.

287
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,465
You'll be in trouble if Kirche
attacked you again.

288
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,581
What is it?

289
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,606
You're really sure you don't
feel something for...

290
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,921
Dog!

291
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,616
I'm telling you, it's all a joke!

292
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,854
Idiot! Fool!

293
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,687
How should I seduce Saito today?

294
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,134
I'm gonna fall!

295
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,533
Come on, hold on to me!

296
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,470
Where are you grabbing?!

297
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,105
It's flat enough to be your stomach!

298
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,936
Do you want to be kicked off?!

299
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,466
What, they're going out today?

300
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,513
I guess I can use the old

301
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,777
"happen to run into each other
while out" pattern...

302
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,016
Ansur Rel An...

303
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,630
Tabitha! We're going
out today! Get ready!

304
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,831
Void-day.

305
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:36,002
I know just how important
Void-day is to you!

306
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,571
See here... I've fallen in love.

307
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,441
But he has stepped out with
that blasted Vallière!

308
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,510
I have to figure out exactly
where those two are headed!

309
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,636
You understand, right?!

310
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,911
Oh, right, you won't move an inch
unless I explain everything.

311
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,521
I want to chase after the two
because they're headed somewhere,

312
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,790
but I can't catch up unless I get
the help of your familiar!

313
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,189
Please, help me!

314
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,553
You understand now? Thank you!

315
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,506
I grow fonder of your Sylpheed
each time I see it.

316
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,140
Which way?

317
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,165
Well, I was in a rush...

318
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,211
A horse, with two people riding it.

319
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,143
Don't eat them.

320
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,587
Walk a bit slower!

321
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,589
My back is in shambles, you know.

322
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,217
You didn't tell me that it took
three hours on horseback.

323
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,965
I think it was right next
to Viemont's elixir shop...

324
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,233
Oh, here it is!

325
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,200
Swords?

326
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,636
Lately, it's the fad among
even the royalty

327
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,036
to equip their servants with weapons.

328
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,566
You wielded a much bigger
sword the other day.

329
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,778
Was that so?

330
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,871
I want one that's longer and thicker.

331
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,682
Pardon me for saying so,

332
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,785
but I believe this is the right size
for this individual.

333
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,187
I said, I want one that's
longer and thicker!

334
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,620
Sure.

335
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,827
An ignorant noble...
She's just asking for it!

336
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,163
Are you buying me a sword?

337
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,565
It's dangerous if Kirche is after you.

338
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,968
You have to have a way
to defend yourself.

339
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,970
How unusual for someone so stingy!

340
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,271
Who are you calling stingy?

341
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,207
If I spoil my familiar, he'll get
accustomed to it, no?

342
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,607
But I always provide
that which is necessary.

343
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,704
Sorry to make you wait.

344
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:30,850
Amazing!

345
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,586
This is the best item
we have in our store.

346
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:37,857
It was forged by the
famous alchemist mage,

347
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,625
Lord Schvert of Germania!

348
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,794
It slices steel ever so easily!

349
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,729
How much?

350
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,597
Three thousand, if you're
using new gold coins.

351
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,734
You can buy a nice house and garden
with a forest for that much!

352
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,570
A good sword is
comparable to a castle.

353
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,705
It's a good deal if one estate will do.

354
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,907
I only have a hundred
new gold on me.

355
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,204
What, you can't buy it?

356
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,911
Well, a decent claymore costs
about two hundred on average.

357
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,849
Isn't there something that I can buy
with one hundred gold?

358
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,876
One hundred? Well,
I do have something...

359
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,658
Isn't this junk?

360
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,827
Well, it's a bit old.

361
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,731
Don't worry, plenty of use in it
if you tidy it up.

362
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,959
I'll take it.

363
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,358
Thank you!

364
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,938
Something from the clearance bin?

365
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,771
I've had some expenses lately,
so I came up short!

366
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,243
Miss Vallière ordered
a terribly expensive elixir.

367
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,420
It's an entire millennium too early
for you to talk back

368
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,688
about something your master
has given you.

369
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,756
Got that?!

370
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,656
Yes, I understand.

371
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:52,732
That wench came here to woo
Saito by buying him a present!

372
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,927
How conceited! She's nothing
more than Louise the Zero!

373
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,631
Amazing... It's so shiny!

374
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,709
Do you like it?

375
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,678
What's the meaning of this, Zerbst?!

376
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,381
I just happened to find
a sword befitting Saito,

377
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,016
so I'm giving it to him as a present.

378
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,818
So you followed us?

379
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:16,016
How pathetic. You can't even
buy him this cheap sword.

380
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,461
It's hot in here. Maybe I
should take my shirt off.

381
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,758
Is that all right with you?

382
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:29,769
I had mistaken the price.
It was twenty-five hundred...

383
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,337
Isn't that a bit expensive?

384
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,829
Is that so? Then, two thousand.

385
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,734
Five hundred.

386
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,804
It's five hundred, right?

387
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,714
Yeah... Five hundred it is.

388
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,717
I'll buy it!

389
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,744
Oh, rats!

390
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,394
I heard this sword was
a masterpiece from Germania.

391
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,897
The best swords and women
come from Germania.

392
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,889
There's no way a Tristein woman
like you can be a match.

393
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,268
Hmph!

394
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,770
I'm sure you just flirted with
too many men in Germania,

395
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,405
so that nobody bothered
to deal with you,

396
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,374
and that's why you came to study
abroad in a neighboring country!

397
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,011
Wasn't that a mouthful?

398
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,672
It's the truth.

399
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:19,715
What is it?

400
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,022
Indoors.

401
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,922
Then let's have Saito decide.

402
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,792
Me?

403
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,761
That's right. We're fighting
over your sword.

404
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,462
Well, if you asked me which,
it's obviously...

405
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,131
But...

406
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,272
I don't think this is a simple
problem about swords.

407
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,406
Which is it?!

408
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,340
I can't say both, can I?

409
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,512
Ouch!

410
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,048
This is as good a chance as any,
so I'll tell you right now.

411
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:52,218
I really hate you.

412
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:55,254
Wow, we must get along. So do I!

413
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,455
A duel!

414
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,557
Seriously?

415
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,559
Come on, hold on, both of you...

416
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,789
Hey, shut up! Stupid women!

417
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,529
Stupid?

418
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,830
Women?

419
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,730
No! It wasn't me!

420
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,131
Sword...

421
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,306
You woke me up from my nice nap.

422
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,475
Um, this sword is speaking.

423
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,813
I'm surprised! Such a silly face,
and yet you're a user?

424
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,548
No wonder why I've woken up!

425
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,584
A user? What's that?

426
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,788
Isn't that an Intelligent Sword,
a sword with its own wisdom?

427
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,990
You sure bought
another strange item.

428
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,228
I didn't know! I'm going to return
this creepy thing right now!

429
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,797
What year is it right now? Or rather,
where the hell is this?

430
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,230
Dammit, answer me!

431
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,294
I'll take this one.

432
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,903
I'm Saito.

433
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,271
It's Derflingher.

434
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,499
Nice to meet you, brother.

435
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,365
Why is it that I get
all the strange ones?

436
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:11,893
As if I were under a real magic spell

437
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:22,931
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

438
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:34,487
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

439
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:45,557
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:57,534
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

441
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:08,410
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

442
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:14,650
For the day to start from zero

443
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,140
Saito!

444
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,276
What in the world are you thinking?!

445
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,978
A mere peasant barging
into a nobleman's home?!

446
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,913
I don't care if anything
happens to you anymore!
