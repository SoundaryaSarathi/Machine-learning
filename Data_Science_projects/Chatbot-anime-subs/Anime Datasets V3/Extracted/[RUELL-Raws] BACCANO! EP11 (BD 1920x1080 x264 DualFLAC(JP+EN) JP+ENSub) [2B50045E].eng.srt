1
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:12,467
<i>I gave up my voice in order to</i>
<i>protect the knowledge I got from you.</i>

2
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,910
<i>Are you saying you will protect me, Chane?</i>

3
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:21,517
I am not about to get devoured.
I'll have to devour them, first.

4
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,397
Who'd have thought it was liquor?

5
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:28,172
This time, we'll case
the Martillo Family's place!

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,448
It's funny, isn't it?
The way people run into each other?

7
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:12,452
It could be that all encounters
are something of a miracle, huh?

8
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:15,845
Yeah. By the way, Maiza-<i>san...</i>

9
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,392
How did that injury of yours
earlier heal so quickly?

10
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,522
If you wouldn't mind,
could you tell me how it happened?

11
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,235
Perhaps someday, I will be able to tell you,

12
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,863
but not right now.

13
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,658
I see.

14
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,620
That woman!

15
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,738
Maiza-<i>san</i>, excuse me for a minute!

16
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:45,917
Firo!

17
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:55,843
You're...

18
00:02:56,302 --> 00:03:00,264
Hey, just a minute! I said just a minute!

19
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,850
Now, take it easy.

20
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:06,562
I just wanted to give this back to you.

21
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,163
Yes. There's only one body.

22
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:28,209
Huh? Yes... Yes...

23
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:32,755
It means that the man is capable
of going toe-to-toe with Chane.

24
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,937
Shoot them both, while they go at it.

25
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:37,301
C-Copy that.

26
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,872
Code Beta has been put into effect.

27
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:42,668
Are we really going to kill Chane-<i>san</i>?

28
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:45,672
He said to go after her while
she's fighting the white suit.

29
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:50,440
I wonder if you'd fill me
in a bit more about that.

30
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,402
Okay, okay, drop the gun.

31
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,194
You there, the timid-looking one,
drop your gun, too.

32
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:58,991
Damn it!

33
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,312
Well, well, he ran away.

34
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,898
I can't say that he's a coward, though.

35
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:08,666
It is, I have to admit,
a normal response to run away after seeing me.

36
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,158
"Chane" would be that woman,

37
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:15,868
and the "white suit" she's
fighting would be me, right?

38
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:21,345
That woman is amazing.
It's the first time I've ever run away.

39
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,765
How about you tell me something?

40
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,769
Why are you going to kill her,
when she's one of your own?

41
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,228
<i>What do I do?</i>

42
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:46,412
<i>Just toss it all in like this, and run away?</i>

43
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,152
<i>I can't very well do that.</i>

44
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:52,877
<i>I have to at least get a look at</i>
<i>the face of the immortal here, first.</i>

45
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,010
Mister, who are you?

46
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,212
Mister,

47
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:09,727
who are you?

48
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,607
Come on, answer. I'm...

49
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,110
...Thomas.

50
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,405
Why are you lying, Czes-<i>kun</i>?

51
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,688
Czeslaw Meyer.

52
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,243
How do you know my name?

53
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,415
A-are you the Rail Tracer?

54
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,417
Oh, good guess.

55
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,672
I am the Rail Tracer.

56
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,952
I also know that you are no kid,

57
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:44,470
and that you want to
kill the other passengers.

58
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,265
And so, you see, I'm going to kill you.

59
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,758
A crimson monster?

60
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:54,968
Are you trying to talk your way
out of this with that ridiculous story?

61
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:59,193
We're not lying!
There really is a monster aboard this train!

62
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,019
Yo, Chane-<i>chan</i>!

63
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:37,231
I hear that you're actually
hated by those black suits.

64
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,985
And that you hate them
right back, don't you?

65
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:47,257
Also, you're the number one
favorite of one Huey Laforet-<i>sama,</i>

66
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:49,493
and you are one of his adherents.

67
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:54,332
What's more, they say
this Huey-<i>sama</i> is immortal, huh?

68
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:58,198
This guy told me all of it.

69
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,295
Right?

70
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,047
"Mm-hmm!"

71
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:08,304
Were you aware that
your black suit buddies were after you?

72
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,697
Those guys appear to be using
all of this confusion to try to kill you.

73
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:17,605
Is it true that you were
actually opposed to this operation?

74
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,566
You don't like taking hostages and such?

75
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,638
It sounded like this Huey guy
was against it from the outset,

76
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,233
but that's weak thinking!
You can trust folks like that the least!

77
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,953
Same for you!

78
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,335
You sure you aren't just
being set up by this Huey guy?

79
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,828
Do you want me to tell you
the very first thing I'm going to do

80
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,136
once I get off this train?

81
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,889
I'm going to kill Huey Laforet.

82
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,985
To be honest,
I'm not all that eager to kill you.

83
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,247
The other black suits all
have that face that says,

84
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:03,693
"There's no way I'm going to die,"
so they're worth killing.

85
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,155
But there's something about you,
like you're risking your life.

86
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,408
That's what made me think.

87
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:14,818
Maybe it would be more
fun to kill this Huey Laforet,

88
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:17,999
whom you find to be
some absolute being, wouldn't it?

89
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,552
Hey, now, is it over already?

90
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:43,983
That's more like it.

91
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,242
I'll kill him anyway!
He may be immortal, but I'll kill him!

92
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,245
Right before your eyes.

93
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:01,208
I'm going to painstakingly
show that saggy bastard,

94
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,838
who thinks he's safe because
he can't die, the harshness of life!

95
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,758
So, what's it going to be, Chane-<i>chan</i>?

96
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:34,033
It's been a long time, Maiza Avaro.

97
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,812
Szilard!

98
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:40,415
In fact, it's been two hundred and some years

99
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,542
since our last glimpse,
aboard the <i>Advenna A vis.</i>

100
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,631
Who's this guy, Maiza?

101
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,548
Someone you know?

102
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,092
Please, run away.

103
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,998
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:55,805
Everyone, please,
say nothing more, and run away.

105
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,628
I am the only one this man is after.

106
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:02,228
So just who is this guy?

107
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,067
This man is someone who
has killed 13 of my friends,

108
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,779
as well as my younger brother.

109
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,743
I've devoured five more since then,
so to be accurate, it's 18.

110
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,858
Szilard...

111
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,398
I don't know what's going on here,

112
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:25,568
but Maiza, you're saying that
this guy is your enemy, right?

113
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:28,963
Well then, that makes
him <i>our</i> enemy, doesn't it?

114
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,054
What are you doing?!

115
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,641
Don't go in.
You'll only be killed, for no reason.

116
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,643
What?

117
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,008
Maiza, why is this old geezer...

118
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,638
...still standing?!

119
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:54,392
I'll explain later.
Right now, just run away, please!

120
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,157
A wise warning.

121
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,993
But it's a little too late.

122
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,658
Don't go punching holes
in the conductor's compartment.

123
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,717
You grazed my ear, you know.

124
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,470
If you read me, apologize.

125
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,101
At least say you're sorry.

126
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,193
Oh, I didn't know.

127
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,195
Sorry.

128
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,749
You can keep going.

129
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,408
I'll kill whichever one of you lives through it.

130
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,738
Who are you?

131
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:55,382
Don't worry about it.
Think of me as talking air, if you like.

132
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,969
If you're air, then stop talking!

133
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,351
That was pretty harsh.

134
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,656
You bitch!

135
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,494
Is what he said about you earlier the truth?

136
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,318
You know, about how you were
actually opposed to this operation,

137
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,488
how you don't very much like to kill,

138
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,169
and how this Huey guy objects to it, too?

139
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,839
I see. Well then, fine.

140
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:39,872
That being the case,
would you like a little assistance here?

141
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:43,042
Huh? Isn't that a bit strange?

142
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,048
I'm not sure I'm following,
but you're the one who's been going around,

143
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,798
killing the black suits
and my pals, aren't you?

144
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:52,940
Yeah, but after hearing
what you said a moment ago,

145
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,762
this woman comes out
sounding like a good girl.

146
00:12:56,762 --> 00:13:00,406
Don't you screw with me, you monster!
Are you one of <i>those</i>?

147
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:05,148
The type of person who,
when a kid comes at them on the battlefield,

148
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:08,289
doesn't kill him, but spares him, instead?

149
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,652
Here I thought
you were this terrifying monster,

150
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,862
but you're just a sickening
hypocrite, aren't you?!

151
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:15,425
So what if I'd spare him?

152
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,493
Huh?

153
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:20,912
My thinking is that it's precisely
<i>because</i> I'm so sure of myself

154
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:23,487
that having that kind of
compassion is possible, you see.

155
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,777
I'm fine on that point.

156
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:29,883
The reason being that
there is <i>no way</i> I'm going to be killed.

157
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:33,342
Remember this Leniency
and compassion are things

158
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,399
that only the strong
are privileged to possess.

159
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,276
And I...

160
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,777
...am strong.

161
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,518
You're one of <i>those</i>, then?

162
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:44,648
Someone who really thinks
that they're not going to die?

163
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:49,413
Of course. After all, the world is mine.

164
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,832
Let me go! I have friends in there!

165
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:07,973
No, you can't go in right now!

166
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,186
Who are you?

167
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,358
Who is the old coot in there?

168
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:22,404
You really are a stupid man, Maiza.

169
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,228
If only you hadn't been so greedy,

170
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:27,688
and shared your
information with me back then,

171
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:30,272
blood wouldn't have had to
be spilled like this.

172
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:31,330
Szilard!

173
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,488
What is this?

174
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:38,045
Don Martillo, please, allow us to handle this.

175
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,742
It's possible that this is
a matter of internal friction on our part.

176
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:42,828
But...

177
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:47,958
If anything were to happen to you,
I wouldn't be able to face Firo.

178
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,878
Please, put your concerns to rest.

179
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:54,184
Go look around upstairs,
and check out our office, too.

180
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:54,895
Right.

181
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,258
What do we do if they
get back at them, Miria?

182
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:00,178
It will be our fault, huh?

183
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,972
If that happens,
we can't justify it to these people.

184
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,905
It's a question of blame, huh?

185
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,358
Why are you so hung up on the drug?

186
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:13,497
That's easy.
I just want to know, that's all.

187
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,028
My greatest desire is to
uncover the secret of the medicine

188
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,420
that you're trying to keep covered up.

189
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,328
Only so you can increase
the number of people you can kill.

190
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:27,719
That's not true.
My methods are extremely reasonable.

191
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:35,227
You're saying, people who drink
that liquor become immortally young?

192
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,064
And that Maiza-<i>san</i> and
the old guy are immortal, too?

193
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,158
Who are you?

194
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,938
I created an imperfect
version of the medicine,

195
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,165
using the information I gained from Gretto.

196
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,666
Imperfect?

197
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,919
Medicine that won't keep you
from aging, but will make you undying.

198
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,578
Once strong men are
made to drink it, those of us

199
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:09,470
who drank the finished product
are able to devour them arbitrarily.

200
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,798
We are able to gain their knowledge and skills
without any trouble on our part.

201
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:19,813
It's a swift and sure method,
don't you think?

202
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,218
A man-made person? You?

203
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,570
Yes, and the one who
made me is Szilard, there.

204
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,273
As a specialized, independent colony,

205
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:34,495
I am capable of being
given knowledge from Szilard.

206
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:41,585
In turn, Szilard is able to separate
the female cellular components

207
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,408
and Szilard's own immortal cellular
components within my cells to...

208
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,590
Wait, wait, wait!

209
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,538
I'm not that smart!
Tell me using simple terms.

210
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:52,346
What I'm saying is...

211
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,008
To put it briefly,
I am made to live by Szilard's will,

212
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,603
and I can also be killed by it.

213
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,694
You're weak. You've wasted
these 200 years, haven't you?

214
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,494
Let me show you the fruits of my 200 years.

215
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,211
Disgraceful bunch.
They got into it after all, did they?

216
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,588
What are you talking about?

217
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,202
What's up with that?
How can anything be so self-serving?

218
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:34,668
To Szilard, I must be
something like a daughter.

219
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:36,668
What kind of father can
kill his daughter on a whim,

220
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:39,851
and in addition, overwork his
daughter under the threat of doing so?!

221
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,382
Don't play dumb.

222
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:46,191
This is the same "grand panacea"
that we both once drank.

223
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:52,239
I finally succeeded in
perfecting it on my own.

224
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:58,318
There's no way a pretty girl like you
could be the daughter of that geezer.

225
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,372
I assure you of that.

226
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,044
Quite a passionate display, there.

227
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,591
--The guys from yesterday...
--Dallas? What are you doing here?

228
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,818
Surprised? You see, I'm an immortal.

229
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,307
I know. Fascinating.

230
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:49,921
It means, I could flay you alive,
gouge out your eyes,

231
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,702
and crush your heart in my hands
while you're still alive,

232
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,828
and you wouldn't be fazed by it.

233
00:18:55,828 --> 00:19:00,974
Go ahead and do it.
I'm accustomed to that level of pain.

234
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,938
Have you ever had hot fireplace tongs
thrust into your eyes?

235
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,692
Have you ever been dipped in an acid bath?

236
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,946
Have you ever been
thrown alive into a fireplace?

237
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:26,041
I lived with having someone
I trusted give me that sort of pain daily.

238
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,158
I will not be daunted by your kind of violence.

239
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:34,549
I am prepared to handle
more pain than you are capable of!

240
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,426
You're hopeless.

241
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,430
That much is just a mere diversion.

242
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,212
Have you ever had your arm
muscles carefully stripped off

243
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:45,560
while you were still alive?

244
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,648
And then had any carving
done on the bones of your arm?

245
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,652
Do you know the methods
of execution they use in China?

246
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,779
What about Japanese torture?

247
00:19:56,321 --> 00:20:00,659
Because of my line of work,
I know tons of ways to give pain.

248
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,162
Including those that presuppose killing.

249
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,665
Czeslaw Meyer,

250
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:12,879
you do indeed seem to be
prepared for a certain level of pain.

251
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:18,828
But what was that look of uneasiness
that appeared in your eyes

252
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:22,389
when you first faced me-- the Rail Tracer?

253
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,355
What you are afraid of is the unknown.

254
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:33,468
You're thinking that there
might be pain and suffering to a level

255
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:37,779
that you've never experienced before.

256
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:42,367
Let me be the one to
give you that pain unknown.

257
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,662
Until you forget how to come back to life.

258
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,112
Having the black suits leave all
on their own is lucky for us, huh?

259
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:54,796
You bet. Which means
it's about time we were...

260
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,578
All right, you people, give us your money!

261
00:20:57,578 --> 00:20:59,676
And not just your
money, your valuables, too!

262
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,218
We've taken over this train now!

263
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:15,598
If you want to stay alive,
please do as you're told!

264
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:17,986
Uh, are you sure you're not overstating it?

265
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:19,988
Jacuzzi!

266
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,227
I'm sorry we startled you.

267
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:33,362
What's going on here?

268
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,448
I'd heard tales about this,

269
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:38,317
but this is the first time
I've seen it for myself.

270
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:41,802
Well, well, Don Bartolo Runorata.

271
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,888
It's been a long time, Luck Gandor.

272
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,529
First, let me apologize for
our careless handling of this.

273
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,322
Much obliged.

274
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,358
Still, whatever would bring
Don Runorata himself to our door?

275
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:15,585
The situation is just that serious,
what with the secret you boys have.

276
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,328
Let me come right to the point.

277
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,298
Come join yourselves under our umbrella.

278
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,202
You'll be treated right.

279
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:27,305
I must decline.
I wouldn't want to become a test subject.

280
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:31,476
Then there's one thing
we can compromise on.

281
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,485
Hand over Dallas Genoard.

282
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:37,899
Do that, and we will
never get in your way again.

283
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,818
What do you say?

284
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,098
I'm afraid I can't accept your proposal--

285
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:45,574
Where is Dallas right now?

286
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:07,376
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

287
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:21,640
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

288
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:33,188
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

289
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:40,238
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

290
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:47,328
<i>I believe so</i>

291
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:54,418
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

292
00:23:54,418 --> 00:24:01,848
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

293
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:08,602
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

294
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:18,656
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

295
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,674
<i>What do we do, Miria?</i>!<i>It says that Firo</i>

296
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,221
<i>and the three Gandor brothers</i>
<i>are felled by assassins' bullets</i>!

297
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:31,931
<i>That's terrible</i>!<i>Firo, and Luck, and who else?</i>

298
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:33,931
<i>Firo, and Luck, and Berga, and then...</i>

299
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,804
<i>And then...</i>

300
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:36,561
<i>Er, in any event, it's terrible</i>!

301
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:39,896
<i>We can't remember who he is,</i>
<i>but in any event, it's terrible</i>!
