1
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,148
All right, then!

2
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:51,298
What, you again?
You never learn, do you?

3
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:19,620
Over here!

4
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:37,213
Well then, I'll be
taking some meat again!

5
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:47,022
Your tail is going to
disappear before long.

6
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,675
Looks like you've gotten
a little bit better.

7
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:50,655
Wow, to think that Kami-<i>sama</i>
is going to be training us!

8
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,658
Damn, I'm just itching all over!

9
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:56,127
Take it easy, take it easy.

10
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:59,858
In any case, we have to find
Tenshinhan and Chaozu.

11
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,835
Those two are going to be so surprised!

12
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:07,806
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>, after you and everyone
else have Kami-<i>sama</i> make you stronger,

13
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:10,608
those Saiyans will be nothing to you!

14
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:14,567
That's for sure! If you're coming,
then bring it on, Saiyans!

15
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:27,224
<i>Wake up, Nappa! Wake up!</i>
<i>Open your eyes, Nappa!</i>

16
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:32,297
Have we arrived at Earth already?

17
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:39,304
No, not yet. I thought we might stop off
on the way, and set my wake-up timer.

18
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:40,972
Stop off somewhere, you say?

19
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:45,310
There's a pretty good planet
ahead of us. We can sell it for a lot!

20
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,005
Understood.

21
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:55,082
Sleeping for one year straight gets you
all out of form, so this will be perfect!

22
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,536
W- what is this?

23
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,298
You're sure we can sell a place
like this for a high price?

24
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,959
In any event...

25
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,533
...it looks like we'll need to inspect
this place a little more thoroughly.

26
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,919
What ugly creatures those are!

27
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,513
They look like they're space men.

28
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,259
To think that we would come
across space men on our hunt!

29
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,456
I'm sure that Moai-<i>sama</i> will be pleased!

30
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,266
Moai?

31
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,826
This planet's king! Our ruler!

32
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,467
You've come all the way from outer space.
Stay here for a while!

33
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,627
This will be interesting!

34
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,219
Stop, Nappa.

35
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:48,633
This could be an opportunity.
Let's let them introduce us to this Moai.

36
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,157
Here...

37
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,132
Don't scare us like that!

38
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,254
Freeze, you bank robber!

39
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:12,381
You're under arrest!

40
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,952
What pests!

41
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:19,556
This money is a present for Ten-<i>san</i>!
You guys stay out of it!

42
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,030
Just you wait, Tenshinhan!

43
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,023
I'll feed you all kinds of
nutritious things with this money!

44
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,895
Behave yourselves for a
little while now, space men.

45
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,903
It looks like quite an
enjoyable little planet, huh?

46
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:13,311
I- it's true! You're space men!
I've never seen any before!

47
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:17,815
Never mind, he's now finally
started reaching out after space men.

48
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,818
How far is he going to go
before he's satisfied?

49
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,488
You have come to this
planet at a bad time.

50
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:26,980
Ever since Moai has claimed the throne,
things have been crazy.

51
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:31,662
Everyone in the general population
has become Moai's toys!

52
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:35,598
And as for me, I had my wife
stolen from me on our wedding day!

53
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,263
Do you understand how I feel?

54
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,133
Oh, my adorable Lemuria!

55
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,307
What's the matter, Lemuria?

56
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,647
Nothing special...

57
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:56,685
Don't tell me you're still
thinking about that other man.

58
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:15,363
Please, stop! Spare me!

59
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,138
L- let me out!

60
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,544
I beg you!
P- please, I beg you!

61
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:40,620
D- don't eat me! Please!
I- I don't want to die!

62
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,141
I'm bored.

63
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,622
What? You say you've
captured some space men?

64
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,290
Yes.

65
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,320
Interesting. Bring them here.
If they're cute, I'll make them my pets.

66
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,300
What is this?

67
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,637
C- could they be the ones?

68
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,164
I- it's them! How did they
get out of the prison?

69
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,482
I- incredible...

70
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,124
W- what power those guys have!

71
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:52,336
What ugly creatures!
There's no way I can keep them as pets.

72
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,531
Right, Lemuria?

73
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,944
Hey, space men! How would you
like to make a wager with me?

74
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,279
Wager?

75
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,582
Have a go at fighting against my warriors.

76
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,618
If you win, I'll give you
anything you like.

77
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:12,351
Although, no matter how you look at it,
there's no chance of you beating them.

78
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:22,358
I'd like to see what kind of blood
is spilled by space men. Go!

79
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:40,712
W- what? What the hell's going on here?

80
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:45,046
You said you'd give us
anything we liked, right?

81
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,992
In that case...

82
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,187
...we'll take this planet!

83
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,664
What!?

84
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:58,192
Didn't you hear him? We're taking
this planet, and your lives!

85
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,626
I- impossible!

86
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:26,528
Don't you get it yet? We let
ourselves be captured on purpose.

87
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:31,302
In order for us to be
led in here, you see.

88
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,635
Kill them!
Cut them to bits!

89
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,553
Ain't I at Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place yet!?

90
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:30,587
Yedi! Release Yedi!

91
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:01,592
So this monster is your
ace in the hole, huh?

92
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:04,959
Let them have it, Yedi!
Kill those two!

93
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,264
May I?

94
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:09,164
Suit yourself.

95
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,624
Fool! You intend to test your
strength against Yedi's!?

96
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,416
Y- Yedi!

97
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,189
I'm done playing around!

98
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,888
W- what's this?

99
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,972
I- incredible! You guys are incredible!

100
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,576
You are indeed the
saviors of this planet!

101
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:02,910
Peace is sure to return to this
planet now, just as it was before!

102
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,828
Atla!

103
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,256
Atla!

104
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:26,498
L- Lemuria?

105
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:47,549
This is hopeless. We won't be
able to get squat for this planet.

106
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,722
Let's go, Nappa.

107
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:54,161
Atla!

108
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:11,271
Get out of my sight,
you good-for-nothing planet!

109
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,487
Lemuria!

110
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,615
Atla!

111
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,238
They're beautiful when they're obliterated,
no matter what planet they happen to be.

112
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:57,294
Still, I hope this Earth turns out to be
a little bit better of a planet than this.

113
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:59,830
Hey, if it turns out to be
another good-for-nothing planet,

114
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,632
we'll just blow it away too.

115
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:04,931
After we've gathered those
Dragon Ball things, that is.

116
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:09,072
Eternal life, huh?
I'm looking forward to that!

117
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:24,988
<i>Such terrible, heartless Saiyans!</i>
<i>ls there any future for earth?</i>

118
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:31,484
<i>Elsewhere, Goku single-mindedly continues</i>
<i>to run in order to meet Kaio-sama.</i>

119
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,022
This sure is long!
