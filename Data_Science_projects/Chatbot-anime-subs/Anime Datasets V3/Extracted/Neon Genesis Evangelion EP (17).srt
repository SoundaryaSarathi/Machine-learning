00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,750
Are you refusing to allow us to
question the pilot of Unit 01,

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,690
the only one directly involved in
the incident, Major Katsuragi?

24
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,960
Yes, Sir. Because he is
emotionally very unstable,

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,530
I believe that it would be unwise
to have him here.

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,200
Then, as his proxy, let us ask you,
Major Katsuragi.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
In this incident,

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,210
didn't the Angel attempt to
communicate with a human being?

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,940
I find no suggestion of that
in the subject's report.

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,380
I believe this was an irregularity,
a coincidence.

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,920
If, and only if, his memory
is correct.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,580
There is no evidence that his
memory has been tampered with.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,790
However, the Eva's AC recorder
was not functioning.

34
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,920
There's no way to confirm it.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,730
Was the Angel interested in the
human spirit? In the human mind?

36
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,760
I am unable to answer
that question.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,700
Whether the Angels even have
a concept of what "Mind" is,

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,030
or whether they can understand
human thoughts or not

39
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,470
is completely unknown.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,270
A new factor has been added
with this incident,

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,140
in that the Angel tried to
take Eva into itself.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,840
Is there any possibility that this
aspect may be linked

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,750
to the predicted Thirteenth Angel
and all Angels thereafter?

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,250
Based on the previous patterns,

45
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,220
there appears to be no systematic
organization among the Angels.

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,290
Correct! It is obvious that they
have worked independently, so far.

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,160
What do you mean, Sir?

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,190
You are not allowed to
ask questions.

49
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,690
Understood.

50
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,690
That will be all. Dismissed.
Understood.

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,600
That will be all. Dismissed.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,090
Yes, Sir.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,800
What do you think, Ikari?

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,500
The Angels appear to be getting
more and more intelligent.

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,570
There's not much time left.

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,670
Episode 17
The Fourth Child
<i> </i>
Left for us, you mean?

57
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,680
Who's the patient in Room 12?

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,820
That's the emergency room patient
from the first Eva incident.

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,050
She's been here for a long time.

60
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,720
Her injuries are really difficult,
poor girl.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,590
She's still in elementary school.

62
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,360
He's here again today?

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,330
Yeah, he comes to see her
at least twice a week.

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,760
He's a good brother, thinking
about his sister like that.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,400
Yeah, boys like that
are pretty rare.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,890
He has a good heart.

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,640
Rei, are you all right today?

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,310
Yes, Sir. I will be with
Dr. Akagi tomorrow,

69
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,550
and the day after
I'll be at school.

70
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,010
How is the school?

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,150
No problems, Sir.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,080
I see. That's good.

73
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,450
Stand up! Bow! Sit down!

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,420
Let me see, Ayanami is absent
as usual, and Aida too?

75
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,630
What's up with Kensuke?
<i> </i>

76
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,330
What's up with Kensuke?
<i>Professor Koike is absent today,</i>

77
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,830
He went to New Yokosuka to see a battleship.
<i>Professor Koike is absent today,</i>

78
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,330
He went to New Yokosuka to see a battleship.
<i>So the class in modern Japanese will be self-study.</i>

79
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,100
A ship called Myoko or something is in port.
<i>So the class in modern Japanese will be self-study.</i>

80
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,270

<i>And finally, the student on duty today will be...</i>

81
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,200
Mister Suzuhara.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,770
Yes, Sir!
Mister Suzuhara.

83
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,040
Yes, Sir!
<i> </i>

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,980
Will you deliver this document to
Miss Ayanami after school?

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,470
Yes, Sir!

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,520
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>First Branch is okay.</i>

87
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,580
<i>The data from the recon plane will</i>
<i>be confirmed by the MAGI.</i>

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,690
It disappeared?!

89
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
The entire Second Branch
just vanished?!

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,560
<i>Yes, Sir, it's been confirmed.</i>

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,050
<i>It's gone.</i>

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,430
Dear God...

93
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,000
Administration and Investigation
sections are going crazy,

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,930
and General Affairs
is in a total panic.

95
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,040
What was the cause?

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
It's still under investigation.

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,370
Our only clues are these
geo-synchronous satellite photos.

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,470
There's nothing else left.

99
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,070
10 seconds...

100
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,750
8...

101
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,680
7...

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,650
6...

103
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,550
5...

104
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,480
4...

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
3...

106
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,190
2...

107
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,020
1...

108
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,510
Contact.

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,800
This is horrible.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,230
Evangelion Unit 04,

111
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,800
its support group and all other
facilities within an 89km radius

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,340
were completely destroyed.

113
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,010
Along with thousands of people.

114
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,180
Looking at the time schedule,

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,350
It seems they were installing the
experimental S2 engine.

116
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,650
Potential causes range from

117
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,620
a lack of structural integrity to a
preliminary design stage error.

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,350
That's 32,768 possibilities
right there.

119
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,520
And that's not mentioning
sabotage.

120
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,630
But it wasn't an explosion, was it?

121
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,090
It was a disappearance.

122
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,360
In all probability, they were
swallowed by a Sea of Dirac,

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
just like Unit 01 was.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,200
And the restored S2 engine?

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Gone, along with our hopes.

126
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,610
It's all because we're being forced
to use things we don't understand.

127
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,540
<i>Things like the Evas.</i>

128
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,680
What'll we do with Unit 03?

129
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,820
We'll receive it here.

130
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,220
The U.S. Government doesn't want
to lose the First Branch as well.

131
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,160
Didn't they insist on the right to
build Units 03 and 04?

132
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,830
And now they're foisting
it off on us?

133
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,460
They're really pushing their luck.

134
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,060
After a disaster like that, anyone
would get nervous.

135
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,200
And how are you going to
do the test activation?

136
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,070
Will you use Rei's dummy plug?

137
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,390
I'll have to make a decision.

138
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,440
This is the dummy plug prototype.

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,710
Rei's personal data has
been loaded into it,

140
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,680
but it's not really possible to
digitize a human mind and soul.

141
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,480
A fake, that's all it is.

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,420
It copies a pilot's thinking
process.

143
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,220
In the end, it's only a machine.

144
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,960
It transmits a signal
pattern to Eva,

145
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,460
and Eva believes there's a pilot
and synchronizes. That's enough.

146
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,260
Load the data into Unit 01
and Unit 02.

147
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,530
There are still some
problems with it.

148
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,170
That's not important. As long as
the Eva activates, it's sufficient.

149
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,660
Understood.

150
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,810
I've delegated the transportation
of the Unit to the U.N.

151
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,110
It will arrive by the end
of the weekend.

152
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,180
You'll take care of it from there.

153
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,250
Yes, Sir.

154
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,720
We'll perform the modifications
and activation test in Matsushiro.

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
And the test pilot will be...

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Use of the Dummy Plug is not
recommended at this time.

157
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,820
One of our prospective
candidates...

158
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,590
Will be chosen as the
Fourth Child?

159
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,260
Yes, there is one child whose core
can be prepared immediately.

160
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,360
Then, I'll trust you to make it so.

161
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,850
Yes, Sir.

162
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,720
Rei, we're finished now.

163
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,570
Yes, Sir.

164
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,010
Let's eat.

165
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes, Sir.

166
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,470
Stand up! Bow!

167
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,550
Lunch time! Lunch time! This is
the single best thing about school.

168
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,130
You didn't make lunches for us?

169
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,360
I didn't have time to cook last
night. I had too much homework.

170
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,300
And that's your excuse for me
having to go without lunch?!

171
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,370
A husband and wife quarrel?

172
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,400
It's not like that!

173
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,070
What is it? You look so serious.

174
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,720
It's the Unit 03 activation test.

175
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,150
We'll be using the Fourth
as the pilot.

176
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,450
The Fourth?

177
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,920
The Fourth Child's been found?

178
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,420
Just yesterday.

179
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,260
But I haven't received a report
from the Marduk Institute yet.

180
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,020
The official documents will be
delivered tomorrow.

181
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,770
Dr. Akagi, are you hiding
something from me again?

182
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,240
No, nothing at all.

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,600
Well, okay. So, who's the kid?

184
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,050
Jeez! It's HIM?!

185
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,480
It can't be helped.

186
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,020
All the possible candidates were
gathered together for protection.

187
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,590
It's so hard to tell them.

188
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,390
Asuka will be fine. Her pride
keeps her piloting her Eva.

189
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,800
Rei is exceptional,

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,600
with no problems with her
Eva or our work.

191
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,340
Shinji probably knows the most
about the down side.

192
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,960
I don't want him to suffer
any more hardships.

193
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,770
But we need children of this kind,

194
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,980
in order for us all to survive.

195
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,640
Are you saying not to
complicate the issue?

196
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,250
Bye! Later!

197
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,690
Suzuhara, you've got the duty
this week. Get to work!

198
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,890
What do you mean?

199
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,600
The class printout!

200
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,170
Didn't our teacher tell
you to deliver this?

201
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,270
Come on, you can ask the other
person on duty, can't you?

202
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,400
Miss Ayanami is absent today!

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Ayanami and me?

204
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,100
Then I guess there's no choice.

205
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,750
But I don't want to go to some
girl's place all by myself.

206
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,380
Well, I can go with you...

207
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,180
Shinji!

208
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,450
Walk home with me, will you?

209
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,110
Ayanami, we're coming in.

210
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,110
You can't enter a girl's room
without her permission.

211
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,410
We've got no choice.

212
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,380
She won't see it if we
leave it there.

213
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,210
Excuse us...

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,900
Good grief!

215
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,600
Is this a girl's room?
It's so decrepit.

216
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,790
Hey, you shouldn't touch anything!
She'll get pissed!

217
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,780
I'm just cleaning up.

218
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,060
I won't help you!

219
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,560
That's not a man's job!

220
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,930
Okay, but Misato hates
guys like that.

221
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,190
I don't care! It's my policy!

222
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,240
Come to think of it,
you've changed.

223
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,110
What?

224
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,580
You, Shinji.

225
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,280
The first time I saw you, I really
thought you were a jerk.

226
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,860
You didn't seem like you would do
something for someone else.

227
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,660
I guess you're just
really reserved.

228
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,070
Excuse us!

229
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,910
What?
<i> </i>

230
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,570
What?
Those are the school bulletins that have piled up.

231
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,670
Those are the school bulletins that have piled up.

232
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,420
I took it upon myself
to clean up a little.

234
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,010
But I didn't touch anything
except trash.

235
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,960
Thank you.

236
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,790
Eva pilots are sure
weird all right.

237
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,500
Thank you...

238
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
Words of gratitude.

239
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,340
Words I've never used.

240
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,450
Not even to him.

241
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,910
The city, a paradise
made by Mankind.

242
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,680
Driven from Paradise,

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,710
Man escaped to this earthly
existence, on the edge of Death.

244
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,360
Created by the weakest of beings,

245
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,830
created by the sapience born
from that weakness,

246
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,030
this paradise is our creation.

247
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,630
To protect ourselves from
the fear Death instills,

248
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,400
to satiate our beings
with pleasure,

249
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,130
we create a paradise by
and of ourselves.

250
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,310
This city's surely such a paradise.
A city armed to protect us.

251
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,710
A city of refugees from the outer
world, the world of our enemies.

252
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,250
But cowards do live longer.

253
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,150
That's to our benefit.

254
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,420
The third New Tokyo, NERV's
hidden intercept base,

255
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,130
the delayed seventh construction
phase will be finished soon.

256
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,390
At long last, it will be completed.

257
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,500
How will you report Unit 04's
"accident" to the committee?

258
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,830
With the facts, the cause
is unknown.

259
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,150
But this is a major,
catastrophic loss.

260
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,380
Unit 04 and the Second Branch
are of no consequence.

261
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,920
The S2 engine prototype
may have been lost,

262
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,550
but the data is still on
record in Germany.

263
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,460
This installation and Unit 01
will be sufficient.

264
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,150
But the committee is in a panic.

265
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,820
Of course, it was an
unscheduled accident.

266
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,900
Seele must be busy changing
the schedule.

267
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,200
Incidents not depicted in the
Dead Sea Scrolls may occur.

268
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,900
This ought to teach those
old men a lesson.

269
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,910
<i>The Third District Transformation</i>
<i>and Direction Weapon experiment</i>

270
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,310
<i>is on schedule.</i>

271
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,180
The intercept system is completed,
<i>is on schedule.</i>

272
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,210
The intercept system is completed,
<i>Will Dr. Nishizono of the Technical Department,</i>

273
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,310
and they're not going to have a party?
<i>Will Dr. Nishizono of the Technical Department,</i>

274
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,050
and they're not going to have a party?
<i>Call Section 2 of the R&D Division immediately.</i>

275
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,780
NERV is a most inflexible organization.
<i>Call Section 2 of the R&D Division immediately.</i>

276
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,080
NERV is a most inflexible organization.</i>
<i> </i>

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
It's because of Commander Ikari.

278
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,220
And are you a prude too?

279
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,790
Are you serious, Mr. Kaji?

280
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,830
I'll tell Ms. Katsuragi
and Dr. Akagi.

281
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,930
Not if your mouth is covered
with mine.

282
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,660
So, how's it going?

283
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,670
Well, it's going, I guess.

284
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, I have work to do.
Excuse me.

285
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,800
Far be it from me to make
judgments on your private life,

286
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,540
but should you really be hitting
on girls in this organization?

287
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,810
Who's under whom isn't
your concern.

288
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,580
Or would you prefer I hit
on you, Katsuragi?

289
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,380
It depends on how you
answer my questions.

290
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,680
You know the secrets of the
Marduk Institute and Adam, right?

291
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,760
What secrets?

292
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
Don't try to feign ignorance!

293
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,860
Asking for help isn't like you.

294
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,430
You know, right now I don't care.
I'm not feeling very reserved.

295
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,600
The Fourth Child was conveniently
found at just the right time.

296
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,430
What's the truth behind that?

297
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,900
I'll tell you one thing.

298
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,540
The Marduk Institute doesn't exist.

299
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,210
NERV is pulling the strings
all by itself.

300
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,010
NERV itself?

301
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,050
Commander Ikari is?

302
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,380
You need to check Code 707.

303
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,870
Code 707?

304
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,520
Shinji's school?

305
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,250
Misato!

306
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,060
What is it?

307
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,190
Ritsuko's expecting you for a
meeting about tomorrow's trip.

308
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,660
All right. Thank you.

309
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,390
See you.

310
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,880
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,770
Buy you a drink? Cup of tea?

312
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,570
But I'm a boy.

313
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,840
I thought you'd be a more
serious person, Kaji.

314
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,580
You're saying that to someone as
straight arrow and reliable as me?

315
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,880
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,450
I'm sorry too. I didn't mean
to sound rude.

317
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,250
Hey, I want to show
you something.

318
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,260
They're watermelons?

319
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,060
Yeah, aren't they cute?
This is my hobby.

320
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,530
Keep it a secret, okay?

321
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Growing... Making something
grow is really great.

322
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,210
One can see and learn so many
things from the process.

323
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,910
It also brings pleasure.

324
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,400
But pain too, right?

325
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,170
Do you hate pain?

326
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't like it.

327
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,180
But have you found what
gives you pleasure?

328
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,830
That's not so bad.

329
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,460
If you know pain and hardship,
it's easier to be kind to others.

330
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,360
Being kind isn't a weakness.

331
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,460
Yes? Hello?

332
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,540
It's Katsuragi.

333
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,440
The synch test will
be starting soon.

334
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
<i>Fix the depth at 3.2.</i>

335
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,310
I thought so. Shinji's synch ratio is dropping.
<i>Fix the depth at 3.2.</i>

336
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,550
I thought so. Shinji's synch ratio is dropping.
<i>LCL thickness is nominal.</i>

337
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,610
I thought so. Shinji's synch ratio is dropping.
<i>Harmonics level is negative 1.1...</i>

338
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,020
What's that mean?
<i>Harmonics level is negative 1.1...</i>

339
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,720
I can't say.
<i>Harmonics level is negative 1.1...</i>

340
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,580
I can't say.

Something in his mind.

347
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,090
This makes it even harder to
tell him about Unit 03's pilot.

The pilot will be officially informed tomorrow.

351
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,600
Stand up! Attention! Bow!

352
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,840
Lunch time!
<i>Attention student Toji Suzuhara...</i>

353
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,580
<i>Toji Suzuhara, report to the Principal's Office.</i>

354
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,040
What the...

355
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,530
What did you do?

356
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,740
I don't know.

357
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,410
Excuse me, I'm Toji Suzuhara.

358
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,260
You're Toji Suzuhara?

359
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,090
How was your trip to
New Yokosuka?

360
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,460
Way cool!

361
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,830
Speaking of which, I picked up
some disturbing information.

362
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,970
Eva Unit 03?

363
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,010
Yeah, the one they built in
America. It's completed, isn't it?

364
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,470
I don't know.

365
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,110
I know it's classified, but please
tell me something.

366
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,980
I really don't know!

367
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,850
Haven't you heard the rumor
that the activation test

368
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,320
will be held at the second test
facility in Matsushiro?

369
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,350
I haven't.

370
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,290
The pilot hasn't been
chosen yet, right?

371
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,050
How would I know?

372
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,060
Misato could pick me for it.

373
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,860
Shinji, would you ask her for me?
I really want to be an Eva pilot!

374
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,390
Really, I don't know.

375
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,040
What about the story that
Unit 04's been lost?

376
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,070
What was that?

377
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,770
You really don't know?

378
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,980
It disappeared along with the
entire Second Branch.

379
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,380
My dad's section was in a panic.

380
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,510
Really?

381
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,020
I think so.

382
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,070
Misato didn't tell me anything.

383
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,160
Well, I guess it doesn't directly
concern the pilots.

384
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,890
If she didn't tell you, it's likely
because you don't need to know.

385
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,090
I'm sorry about bothering you
with weird questions.

386
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,560
But Toji hasn't come back yet.

387
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,740
Thus, we, mankind,

388
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,680
survived the hell called the
Second Impact and rose again.

389
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,180
The number of children has
been decreasing yearly...

390
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,280
Sorry I'm late.

391
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,950
I know about it. Be seated.

392
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,010
Anyway, it is you, the young who
will lead the way to the future...

393
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,860
Let's go home.

394
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,790
What about Toji?

395
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,360
He'll be late.
What about Toji?

396
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,890
He'll be late.
<i> </i>

397
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,490
He's got class duty.

398
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,170
<i>The school is now closing.</i>

399
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,910
<i>All students must go to their</i>
<i>homes immediately.</i>

400
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,400
Suzuhara!

401
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,940
You're on duty.

402
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,680
Line up the desks and write
up the daily record.

403
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,860
I haven't had lunch yet. I'll do
it as soon as I've eaten.

404
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,730
Suzuhara, you always buy your
lunch from the school shop.

405
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,850
That's because there's no one
who cooks for me.

406
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,520
Suzuhara...

407
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,140
I have two sisters. Their names
are Kodama and Nozomi,

408
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,610
and I always cook lunch for them.

409
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,910
That must be a lot of work.

410
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,110
So, I'm actually a good cook,
though you might not think it.

411
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,610
Really?

412
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,450
And I always end up cooking
too much for our lunches.

413
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,010
That's a waste.

414
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,420
If you need help getting rid of
your leftovers, I'll help.

415
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,020
Yes, help me.

416
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,740
Kaji?

417
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,270
Oh, Asuka? Sorry, I'm busy
right now. Can it wait?

418
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh, Asuka? Sorry, I'm busy
right now. Can it wait?

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,170
But you have time to see
Misato, don't you?

420
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,480
Damn! Not right now!

421
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,580
These are our synch data reports.

422
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,750
Four of them?

423
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,960
What in the hell is this?

424
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,990
Who made HIM the Fourth Child?

425
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,020
No! I don't understand!
What is this?!

426
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,650

Eva Unit 03 is delivered to
Matsushiro from America.

430
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,000
People gloried in the peaceful day,
unaware of the coming tragedy.

431
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
The quiet days that collusion
has camouflaged are gone.
