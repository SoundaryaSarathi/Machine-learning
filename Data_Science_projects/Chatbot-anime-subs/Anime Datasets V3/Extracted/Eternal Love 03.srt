<i>[Episode 3]</i>

4
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,199
You may all go.

5
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

6
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,158
You've woken up?

7
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,438
Do you know how long
you've been sleeping?

8
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,318
Ten whole days, and over an hour.

9
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,199
I slept for ten days?

10
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,400
That's right.

11
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,718
Leave us.

12
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,758
You drank all the wine in the palace.

13
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:53,199
Luckily, I was with you

14
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,400
and fed you the anti-hangover medicine
that only Grand Ziming Palace has.

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
Otherwise, the consequences would
have been too horrible to contemplate.

16
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,840
In the ten days I've been asleep,
how has Ninth Disciple been?

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,318
He...

18
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,199
flung himself into a pillar three times

19
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,520
slit his wrists twice

20
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,199
and I think he's also thrown himself
into the lake twice.

21
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,680
I heard he's recently
started to refuse to eat.

22
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
What did you say?

23
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,718
What is so bad about my father?

24
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:27,400
He is the Ghost Lord
who dominates the world.

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,158
Why does he not appeal
to your fellow disciple?

26
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,800
Of course.

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,318
Taking someone as a father
is no trivial matter.

28
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,960
Can you take me to see Ninth Disciple?

29
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,639
What's the rush? Let me finish.

30
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,919
The adoption ceremony is set for
the third day of next month.

31
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,919
Whether or not your Ninth Disciple agrees

32
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,782
the invitations have
already been sent out.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,158
Adoption?

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,360
That means before the ceremony,
nobody can see him.

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,718
- Not even you?
- Of course I can.

36
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,360
But you can't.

37
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,158
Li Jing.

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,840
Preposterous!

39
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,278
You dare to touch Father's people?

40
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
Why not?

41
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:26,399
Even if you were
to die somewhere one day

42
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,000
I wouldn't care.

43
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,278
But you cannot have this person.

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
He is but an immortal.

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,879
He is nothing but bait.

46
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:45,079
If you want to coerce Mo Yuan,
Ling Yu is enough.

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Leave this one for me.

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
If it weren't because Father
took pity on your mother

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,439
he would already have driven you
out of the palace.

50
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,519
Now you're having a good time
fooling around.

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,800
Fooling around?

52
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,680
I say he is clearly a female disciple
that Mo Yuan is hiding in Kunlun Mountain

53
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,319
disguised as a man.

54
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,278
Brother, you do not need
to criticize me so.

55
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,588
The more I fool around,
the more delighted you are.

56
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,120
Isn't that so?

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,278
Very well.

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,240
Very well.

59
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Go and have fun.

60
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,439
When we break off our alliance
with the Celestial Tribe...

61
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll see what you will do then.

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,519
Beautiful woman.

63
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
You are a woman, aren't you?

64
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,319
I have actually already seen through
your male disguise enchantment.

65
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Tell me. Are you a woman?

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,519
<i>Could he really have
seen through my magic?</i>

67
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,079
You... Don't you speak such nonsense.

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,759
Tell the truth.

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,399
You can really see?

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
The people at Kunlun Mountain
didn't see through it.

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,319
All right, so it's clear now.

72
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
You really are a woman.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
The truth was so easily
shaken out of you.

74
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,519
Why are you disguised as a man
here at Grand Ziming Palace?

75
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,720
Are you afraid my father
will force you into his harem?

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,199
Do not worry.

77
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,800
My father is using you two
to lure Mo Yuan here.

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,480
However, your fellow disciple
is quite stubborn.

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,240
He wasn't as comfortable as you,
asleep for ten days.

80
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,240
I heard he has recently
taken up the idea of killing himself.

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,838
Is what you're saying the truth?

82
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,800
The invitations have
already been sent out.

83
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
It is all to humiliate Kunlun Mountain.

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,120
If Mo Yuan comes and rescues you two,
things would still be manageable.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,278
If even Mo Yuan cannot save you two...

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm afraid you and your fellow disciple

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,439
will have your skin torn off
and tendons pulled out

88
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,720
to taunt the Celestial Tribe.

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,160
There is nobody in this world
who can defeat my master.

90
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,480
You have such confidence?

91
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,120
My master is the God of War.

92
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,439
All right, all right.

93
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,240
Your master is most formidable.

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
However, in my opinion

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
it's best not to wage war.

96
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,509
After all, when both tribes
break into war

97
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,605
the world will be plunged into
misery and suffering.

98
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:36,360
How about this?
Wait quietly for a few days.

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
I have already made arrangements.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,278
You'll be sent out of the palace
on the third of next month. How is that?

101
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,040
You're helping me escape?

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
You don't trust me?

103
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
Why are you helping me?

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,199
I find I get along well with you.

105
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,759
Even if you don't take me as a friend,
I will take you as a friend.

106
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,680
All right, regardless of how
Celestial Tribe and Ghost Tribe end up

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,120
since fate brought us together,
we will be friends.

108
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,838
Sit down.

109
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,240
Write down what you want to say
to your fellow disciple.

110
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,560
I will bring it to him tonight
so he can be reassured.

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,838
All right.

112
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,199
By the way, there is something
I want to ask you.

113
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,759
My sister, Yan Zhi,
has taken a liking to you.

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,927
Why don't I send her away with you?

115
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:42,038
You can help me take care of her
for the rest of her life. How is that?

116
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,440
I... I can't, I can't!

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,759
I am also a woman.

118
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,240
Don't make such a joke.

119
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,440
Then tell me how to explain to her
that you are also a woman.

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,519
Don't tell her.

121
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,720
All right. Since you are a woman,
I won't lead my sister amiss either.

122
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,639
Write.

123
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,360
I am the second prince of Ghost Realm.

124
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,038
This is a letter from
your fellow disciple.

125
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,759
Si Yin?

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,798
Read it quickly so I can take it away.

127
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:03,480
Your Highness, how come you suddenly
took a liking to viewing the lotuses?

128
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
You come to the lotus pond
several times a day.

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,480
Isn't it nice to relax once in a while?

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Highness!

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Li Jing?

132
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,038
Has it been arranged?

133
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:46,558
By sending out invitations far and wide
and humiliating Kunlun Mountain

134
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,918
Father is firmly resolved to rebel.

135
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,860
If we let Si Yin go free,
it will be difficult to see him again.

136
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,080
As princess of Ghost Realm, I cannot
be with someone from Celestial Tribe.

137
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:06,440
Much less have the right to say
what my heart wants.

138
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,480
You are right.

139
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,100
It is impossible for
those of Celestial Tribe

140
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,759
to be with those of Grand Ziming Palace.

141
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,840
Master, Master! Come save us quickly!

142
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,471
No, no, you can't come.

143
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:39,110
If you come, you will
fall for Ghost Lord's plot.

144
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,792
You are in Ghost Realm?

145
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,750
You had too much to drink again?

146
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:05,471
A-Yin, I'll tell you a secret.
Do you want to hear it?

147
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:10,072
How much did you drink?

148
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,350
Do you want to hear it?

149
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,432
It seems you really do think of me
as a friend. Go ahead.

150
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,350
A-Yin.

151
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,591
I like you.

152
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,072
You're taking off my clothes again?

153
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:38,230
Since you've tacitly consented,
why must you act so shyly?

154
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,831
When did I tacitly consent?

155
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,032
You like me?

156
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,831
You're drunk and acting crazy.

157
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,192
<i>[Invitation]</i>

158
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,630
Qing Cang actually dared to
openly dishonor Kunlun Mountain.

159
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,192
With Mo Yuan's temper,
he would never tolerate it.

160
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,750
It seems Qing Cang is certain to rebel.

161
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,990
Investigate the situation at
Grand Ziming Palace in secret

162
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,912
especially Qing Cang's
princes and princess.

163
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:01,951
Yes.

164
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,731
This is intolerable!

165
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,586
He dared to kidnap
Kunlun Mountain's disciples

166
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:17,432
and send out invitations
to humiliate Master!

167
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:21,630
That's right!
The Ghost Realm has gone too far!

168
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,032
Second Disciple.

169
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:27,110
With Master in seclusion and
Senior off searching in the mortal realm

170
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,032
only you are in a position
to make decisions.

171
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:32,350
Just say the word, and all of us will
storm into Ghost Realm with you

172
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,792
to rescue Ninth Disciple
and Seventeenth Disciple.

173
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

174
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,392
We must not act so rashly.

175
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,230
- Master.
- Master.

176
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:53,591
All rise.

177
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:56,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

178
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:01,272
Master, Ninth and Seventeenth
have been captured by Qing Cang.

179
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:03,230
The Ghost Lord even spread invitations

180
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,951
forcing Ninth Disciple
to become his godson

181
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,912
mocking Kunlun Mountain in such a manner.

182
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,312
I heard just now.

183
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:12,951
We were just discussing plans to go to
Grand Ziming Palace on a rescue mission.

184
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,870
I alone am enough.

185
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,471
After all, the Ghost Tribe has yet to
declare war on the Celestial Tribe.

186
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,831
It is inappropriate to involve
so many people.

187
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,392
Quickly summon Die Feng back.

188
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,591
When I return, seal off
the mountain immediately.

189
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,152
Nobody else is allowed to come or go
from Kunlun Mountain.

190
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

191
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:49,792
You...

192
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,750
How come I slept in your bed?

193
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,510
You had too much to drink last night.

194
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,750
You came over here
in the middle of the night

195
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,990
and said you like me.

196
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,272
What did you say?

197
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,870
I... I'm telling you
it was not intentional.

198
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,510
I really do think of you as a friend.

199
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,032
Those from Ghost Tribe cannot
be with those of Celestial Tribe.

200
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,272
Yes, it was not intentional on your part.

201
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,072
You...

202
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:25,432
What is the meaning of this?

203
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:28,350
Your demeanor is clearly saying
I took advantage of you.

204
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,110
You nearly tore off
my clothes last night.

205
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,951
That's a lie!

206
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:37,476
You've nearly torn off
my clothes twice now.

207
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,437
You're saying I'm lying?

208
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:40,437
I...

209
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,158
I really took them off?

210
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,278
Immortal.

211
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:14,116
Your Highness.

212
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,678
Have you seen my Second Brother?

213
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:18,557
Second Prince?

214
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:22,518
He was drunk last night.

215
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:24,557
He slept in my room for the night.

216
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,636
And then?

217
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,278
And then...

218
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,836
And then he left.

219
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,718
The past few days, Li Jing and I have
made arrangements to send you two away.

220
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,916
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,396
There's no need to thank me.

222
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:50,998
We of Ghost Tribe have always
done things for our own purposes.

223
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,438
I...

224
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,557
I...

225
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,758
Never mind. Take your time
enjoying the view.

226
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:06,317
<i>It's a shame
I am also a woman.</i>

227
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:09,798
<i>What can I do to not let down
your heartfelt affections?</i>

228
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,916
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

229
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,038
<i>Have I really fallen for her?</i>

230
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,758
Master.

231
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:37,916
Master!

232
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,998
I knew you would come to rescue us!

233
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,218
Are you all right?

234
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:43,944
We will take revenge on another day.

235
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,944
Let's save Ninth Disciple first.

236
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,704
Master.

237
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,346
- Master.
- Ninth!

238
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,904
- Ninth!
- I have been unfilial.

239
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:06,464
I have caused trouble for you.

240
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:08,826
You are my disciple.
There is no need to say such words.

241
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,066
Let's go quickly.

242
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:24,026
Who dares trespass into
Grand Ziming Palace?

243
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:25,226
Attack!

244
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,105
Master, let's go!

245
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,904
Report to Father immediately.

246
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,144
- Yes.
- Yes.

247
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:16,105
Mo Yuan.

248
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,266
I truly cannot believe

249
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:24,865
you would violate the treaty between
our two tribes for your two disciples

250
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:29,144
and slaughter my men at
Grand Ziming Palace.

251
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,306
Qing Cang, how can you call yourself
the lord of Ghost Realm?

252
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,746
This is nothing but an ambush.

253
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:41,266
You went so far as to use
such despicable means

254
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,986
as kidnapping my disciples.

255
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:50,424
If what you want is a duel,
then let's fight.

256
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:54,786
That's exactly what I want.

257
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:15,704
Li Jing!

258
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:18,066
Run! He has the Bell of East Emperor!

259
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,066
Master.

260
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,664
<i>The heavenly trial!</i>

261
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,704
Let's go.

262
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,184
Scum!

263
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,464
Kill me.

264
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,986
Do you think I won't kill you?

265
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,346
Of course I know you want to kill me.

266
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:03,546
And naturally, I also know why
you won't kill me.

267
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,424
Treacherous spawn.

268
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:10,746
Don't you forget who gave you
the utmost glory and splendor!

269
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:12,105
Guards!

270
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:14,464
Lock up this treacherous spawn.

271
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:17,384
Without my permission,
nobody is to let him out!

272
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:18,746
- Yes.
- Yes.

273
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,986
- Master!
- Master!

274
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,746
- Seal the mountain.
- Yes.

275
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:41,026
Zi Lan, here.

276
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:42,306
Everybody else come with me!

277
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:43,346
- Yes!
- Yes!

278
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,506
Master.

279
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,066
Master!

280
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,506
Master! Let me out, Master!

281
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:11,786
Master, let me out!

282
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,546
Master!

283
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:17,944
Master!

284
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,786
I should be the one suffering
these lightning bolts! Master!

285
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:22,506
Let me out!

286
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,625
Let me out!

287
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:29,184
Master!

288
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:38,546
Master! Master!

289
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,690
This is my heavenly trial, Master!

290
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,746
Master.

291
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,326
Master! Master!

292
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,266
- Master!
- Seventeenth, you're awake?

293
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,506
Master!

294
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,026
Master has gone into seclusion.

295
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:15,105
- Master.
- Come.

296
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,944
Master has gone into seclusion?

297
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:19,546
Here.

298
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:26,066
Master endured three lightning bolts
for you yesterday.

299
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:30,944
Seventeenth, you should study and develop
your skills properly from now on.

300
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,226
It wouldn't be right to have Master face

301
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,288
another trial for you
for your next ascension.

302
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:39,346
Lightning bolts...

303
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:43,026
How is Master right now?

304
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,346
Before Master went to
Ghost Realm to save you two

305
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:49,184
he'd already ordered us
to seal the mountain.

306
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,306
I had thought something had happened.

307
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,266
It seems Master was already prepared
to endure lightning bolts for you

308
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,026
but afraid Ghost Tribe
would seek revenge

309
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,163
and we'd be no match for them
with him in seclusion.

310
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:00,424
Seventeenth! Seventeenth!
Where are you going?

311
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,904
Master, are you heavily injured?

312
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:35,865
Master, I have been unfilial.
I have caused you harm.

313
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:38,226
I've learned from you for 20,000 years

314
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:40,890
but I can't even predict
the day of my heavenly trial.

315
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:43,826
Master, come out soon!

316
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:46,786
I'll stew myself in a soup for you.

317
00:27:57,986 --> 00:27:59,586
Master.

318
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:02,411
<i>His injuries are severe.</i>

319
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:03,809
<i>If you keep crying like this</i>

320
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,009
<i>his spiritual balance will be
thrown into disorder.</i>

321
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,569
<i>What a dumb fox.</i>

322
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,611
Greetings, Princess.

323
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:29,049
Have you seen Second Prince?

324
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,769
Second Prince has been imprisoned.

325
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,529
Why?

326
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,651
Because of the two Celestials.

327
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,250
Second Prince.

328
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,529
Second Brother, why don't you
hide out in the mortal realm for now?

329
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,651
Come back when Father's anger
has dissipated.

330
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:07,851
All right.

331
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:11,355
I will wander about at leisure.
You do not need to worry about me.

332
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:17,131
As for you, make sure not to
admit that you freed me.

333
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,329
Second Brother, don't worry.

334
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:23,490
Even if Father found out,
he wouldn't do anything to me.

335
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:29,529
Oh, yes.

336
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:34,611
If you see Si Yin,
send him my regards.

337
00:29:46,171 --> 00:29:50,451
Second Prince, are we going to
the Yijing Gardens that we frequent?

338
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,131
No.

339
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:53,611
We are going to Kunlun Mountain.

340
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:55,049
Kunlun Mountain?

341
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:58,451
That is Celestial Tribe's sacred land!

342
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,809
Seventeenth.

343
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:21,411
I have never seen you so diligent
in the past 20,000 years.

344
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:24,490
Now that the heavenly trial is past,
you know to work on self-cultivation.

345
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,569
You came at the right time, Senior.

346
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:28,451
I have something to ask you.

347
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:31,089
Look here.

348
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:33,730
"When the East Emperor is
brought forth, all shall perish"

349
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,451
"and destruction will
devour the world."

350
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:39,009
Is it saying the Bell of East Emperor
is a top magical artifact

351
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,809
and one of the finest weapons?

352
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:44,611
It was created by Master and is one of
the godly weapons of the Celestial Realm?

353
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,049
Seventeenth, if you were
so diligent before

354
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,490
you wouldn't have needed Master
to suffer the trial for you.

355
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,931
<i>Run! He has the Bell of East Emperor!</i>

356
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,769
Senior, there is a guest here for Si Yin.

357
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:14,171
I am Bai Zhen, fourth son of
Fox King of Qing Qiu.

358
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,451
Fourth Brother!

359
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,611
Fourth Brother.

360
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,971
This is wonderful!

361
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:28,569
I had been with Zhe Yan and the others
ever since I was young

362
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,490
so I have gotten used to
calling him Fourth Brother.

363
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:37,451
Fourth Brother, this is
Mo Yuan's senior disciple

364
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,250
Water King of West Sea's
second son, Die Feng.

365
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,529
The environment at Kunlun Mountain
is indeed very nice.

366
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,891
No wonder Zhe Yan wanted to
send you here to learn.

367
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:48,851
Look at how our little Si Yin has grown.

368
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:52,411
He looks like an elegant and
outstanding high immortal now.

369
00:31:55,971 --> 00:31:57,371
Why are you crying?

370
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:01,891
It's all my fault.

371
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,490
I had Master suffer
the heavenly trial for me.

372
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:09,009
No wonder your aura feels different.

373
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,009
You have actually ascended.

374
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,211
Your master really does
treat you very well.

375
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:16,931
Not many can withstand a heavenly trial.

376
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:20,891
You are family. I'll let you two talk.
I'll have the kitchen cook more today.

377
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,211
No need to go to that trouble.

378
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:25,769
I am just passing by and paying a visit
to Si Yin who has gone through a trial.

379
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,329
I won't be staying long.

380
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:30,569
All the more reason for me to
take my leave. Enjoy your time.

381
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:37,211
Fourth Brother, come.

382
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,931
You just got here and you already need
to leave. Why are you in such a hurry?

383
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,131
It has to do with the Ghost Realm.

384
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,809
Qing Cang?

385
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,329
Yes, it is because of Qing Cang.

386
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:53,411
Speaking of which, why didn't you
stay at Kunlun Mountain?

387
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,250
What did you go to Ghost Realm for?

388
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,851
I heard Second Sister-in-law
was about to give birth.

389
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,529
I wanted to take a look.

390
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,809
You, honestly.

391
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,651
You sure are the Fox King's
youngest daughter.

392
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,611
Just a quick trip out and
you've caused great chaos.

393
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,490
Because of Mo Yuan and Qing Cang's duel
at Grand Ziming Palace

394
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,490
Heavenly Lord has been very concerned
and has summoned Zhe Yan

395
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,049
to discuss how to subdue Ghost Realm.

396
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:21,289
I came along to visit you here.

397
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:23,769
Are they going to subdue Ghost Realm?

398
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,289
Is Qing Cang really
raising an armed rebellion?

399
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,971
It is just a matter of time.

400
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:33,730
You are Mo Yuan's most junior disciple.

401
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,529
You probably won't be in any position
to step onto the battlefield.

402
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:43,089
Once my master, always my mentor.

403
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:46,009
If Master is really going to
lead an army to war

404
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,809
I definitely will not run from it.

405
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,694
On the day Heavenly Father's spirit
returned to chaos

406
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:11,130
I had the weapon, Fuxi Zither,
sealed under Kunlun Mountain.

407
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,771
Even if I have the mind to
lend my assistance in this war

408
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,885
I'm afraid I would be
powerless to kill the enemy.

409
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,931
I understand.

410
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,050
Go to Kunlun Mountain.

411
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,130
Yes.

412
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,690
On the day Qing Cang is defeated

413
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,130
I will send someone to deliver
the peach blossom wine I brew myself

414
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,891
to congratulate you.

415
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:39,610
Thank you, Zhe Yan.

416
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,891
Farewell.

417
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:50,570
Most of the ancient gods
have withered away.

418
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,891
Only a few able ones are left
who now shun the world.

419
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,090
Yet, they cannot be used.

420
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,731
If you want to handle a moment of danger,
Mo Yuan is sufficiently capable.

421
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:05,291
However, if you want to preserve
the continued peace of the world

422
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:09,610
why don't you instead choose
a new and obedient Ghost Lord

423
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,371
and choose the right time
to replace Qing Cang?

424
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,851
Do you have a choice in mind, Dijun?

425
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,489
Heavenly Lord.

426
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:35,170
Ghost Realm's eldest prince, Li Yuan,
views Celestial Tribe with animosity.

427
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,851
Second prince, Li Jing,
has not amounted to anything

428
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:39,771
losing himself in women all day.

429
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:43,130
The rumor is that in order to
strengthen his own power

430
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,530
the eldest prince has been bullying
the second prince.

431
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,291
There is discord between father and son,
and fighting among henchmen.

432
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,690
That is the current situation
in Grand Ziming Palace.

433
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:59,451
Father, what Dijun just said was right.

434
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,971
If we choose the right moment

435
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:04,489
and help Li Jing into power
as Ghost Lord

436
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:07,931
it is indeed a way
to ensure long-lasting peace.

437
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:11,170
Yes.

438
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:19,251
The less accomplished he is,
the easier to control.

439
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,451
Fifth Sister, I'll be leaving now.

440
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,251
Fourth Brother, what is
the name of my little niece?

441
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:34,731
Feng Jiu, Bai Feng Jiu.

442
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,891
Feng Jiu?

443
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,530
Like the flight of a phoenix
for nine days.

444
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,371
It sounds like a magnificent name.

445
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:46,170
Your interpretation is quite nice.

446
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,050
I just wonder if such a name
will negatively affect her marriage.

447
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,811
Has Mother divined her future?

448
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,771
She was just born. Why are you
worried about her marriage?

449
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:57,489
Our Bai family should be
most worried about you.

450
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:01,411
Quickly finish your studies and
return home so we can find you a husband

451
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:04,451
so Mother won't nag at me
all the time to find a wife.

452
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:06,650
You go get married first.

453
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,451
You always use me to misdirect them.

454
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,130
All right, I really have to go now.

455
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,971
Fifth Sister, remember this.

456
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,891
As a disciple of Kunlun Mountain

457
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,010
if you want to follow Mo Yuan into battle

458
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,130
we would be in no position to oppose.

459
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,811
Mother and Father
absolutely wouldn't stop you.

460
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,130
It would be your obligation
as a disciple.

461
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:31,371
However, you need to remember
you also have four older brothers.

462
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:35,331
No matter what happens,
don't try to face it by yourself.

463
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,891
I know.

464
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:05,570
<i>A-Yin, I have come.</i>

465
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,971
I've heard the divine energy
at Kunlun Mountain

466
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:17,489
is most incompatible with our physiques.

467
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:19,170
I'm afraid...

468
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,130
I'm afraid your life essence
will be harmed by the divine energy.

469
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:25,771
Is it that powerful?

470
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:28,650
I would like to see for myself.

471
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,170
Your Highness!

472
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,291
You have followed me
since you were a child.

473
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,650
Have you ever seen me
so serious about anyone else?

474
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,331
I just want to see her.

475
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,074
Wait for me at the foot of the mountain.

476
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:52,931
Don't follow me.

477
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,931
Who trespasses on Kunlun Mountain?

478
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:44,090
Thank you for your assistance.

479
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,650
I am looking for A-Yin.

480
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,931
Seventeenth?

481
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,771
Who are you?

482
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,731
A-Yin calls me Brother.

483
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,130
Brother?

484
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,971
All right, you wouldn't dare lie
at Kunlun Mountain anyway.

485
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,251
Follow me.

486
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:11,971
Wait.

487
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,570
What are you doing?

488
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,090
When on Celestial Tribe's sacred land

489
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,451
it would be inappropriate
to be so unkempt.

490
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,851
That would be disrespectful
to God Mo Yuan.

491
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:43,489
That sounds appropriate.
Follow me.

492
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,891
Second Prince?

493
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:06,650
A-Yin!

494
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:10,489
Thank you for helping me escape
from Grand Ziming Palace that day.

495
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:12,451
Did your father give you
a hard time for that?

496
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,570
How come your face is injured?

497
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,851
I am fine.

498
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,731
A-Yin, I understand now.

499
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:22,291
I came to see you
so we can be with each other.

500
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,931
What did you say?

501
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,731
I am willing to give up
my status and identity.

502
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,891
I only ask to be able to be by your side.

503
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:34,570
I...

504
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:37,130
I...

505
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,891
But...

506
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:41,291
But I am a disciple of Kunlun Mountain.

507
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:47,210
I saw you seemed to get along well
with your wives in Qin Hall.

508
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,331
You aren't lacking in women.

509
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:55,690
I knew it.

510
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,771
I knew I would frighten you.

511
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,610
But listen to me.

512
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,489
Ever since you left Grand Ziming Palace

513
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,130
from the day Father had me
imprisoned in the dungeons

514
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,530
I thought of you day and night.

515
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,851
I know my heart will not
have another from now on.

516
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:28,891
