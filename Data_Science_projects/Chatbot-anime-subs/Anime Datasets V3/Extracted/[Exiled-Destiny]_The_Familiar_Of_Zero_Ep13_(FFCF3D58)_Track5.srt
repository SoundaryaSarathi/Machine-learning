1
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,051
War...

2
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:07,518
Did you say war?!

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,244
Louise...

4
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,280
What is it?

5
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,514
The teacher just said...

6
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:17,126
There will be a solar eclipse
in three days.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,232
He told me that I should fly then.

8
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:25,635
If everything goes well, I will
head straight out of this world.

9
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:29,131
I see. Good for you!

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,643
Congratulations.

11
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:34,813
You've been wanting
to go back so much!

12
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,111
I hope that everything
goes well for you.

13
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,040
That's fine!

14
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:56,801
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

15
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:05,300
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

16
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:15,846
The sky where two moons
never fade away

17
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:22,088
That's an impossibility, right?

18
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:28,666
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

19
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,472
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

20
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:41,105
Even if you trip and
become depressed

21
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:48,382
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

22
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,260
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,566
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

24
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:07,539
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

25
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:16,208
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

26
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:24,221
Louise the Void

27
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:28,426
First, let's send emissaries
to talk it out!

28
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,261
What will come of it?

29
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:33,331
We're up against a large nation
that has entire flagships!

30
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,634
The two paths left for us
are to surrender,

31
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,125
or resist and be annihilated!

32
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:42,130
There will be no surrender!

33
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,808
It is the same as death to
lose one's pride as a noble!

34
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,439
I will take charge of the army.

35
00:02:58,556 --> 00:02:59,853
Three days' time, huh...

36
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,455
You're sympathizing with them?

37
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,896
Who would, to such a girl!

38
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:08,332
Girl? I was talking about
this world as a whole.

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,158
It's so sudden that I can't
organize my feelings right!

40
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,977
Come to think of it, Louise
said she was in a meeting...

41
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,270
But she's kind of late for that.

42
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,686
The battle against Albion...
no, the Reconquista,

43
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,620
cannot be avoided now.

44
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:34,959
Under the direct orders
of Princess Henrietta,

45
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,962
we are reorganizing our armed forces.

46
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:39,764
The Princess is on the front line?!

47
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,266
A war?

48
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,401
This is turning out to be a huge deal.

49
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:46,538
As of today, the Tristein
Institute of Magic

50
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:48,665
will be closed for the
unforeseeable future.

51
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,376
What are you going to do?

52
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,311
I guess I have to go back home.

53
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:58,249
How pathetic. Isn't there anyone
willing to enlist for the country?

54
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,918
Guiche, are you joining the army?

55
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,886
My father is a general,

56
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,855
so I have no choice...

57
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm more or less forced to.

58
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,517
So you don't want to do it.

59
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,820
Louise, what are you going to do?

60
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:13,525
That's a given!

61
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,019
Goodbye...

62
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,528
What's this?

63
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,774
Derf, can you read this?

64
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:00,011
You're fired. Go wherever
you want. - Louise,

65
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,312
so it says.

66
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,301
Fired?!

67
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:05,583
What the hell is she...

68
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,916
Such a waste...
Just a little more, and...

69
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:14,959
Fired?

70
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,326
Louise wrote this out
and disappeared.

71
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:20,431
What are you going to do?

72
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,693
That's a given!

73
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,538
I'm sure she tagged along
with Lady Henrietta.

74
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,529
With the Princess? Why?

75
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,977
War?! Against Albion?

76
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,446
Guiche signed up too.

77
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,082
Well, I'm originally from Germania,

78
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,676
so I'm thinking about
hurrying back home.

79
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:46,650
Princess, please let me
be at your side...

80
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,416
Thank you, Louise.

81
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:59,103
Hey, Derf. What will you do
when I'm gone?

82
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:03,096
I'll be sleeping again in an old item
shop. Nothing's gonna change.

83
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:06,072
I don't live in this world to begin with,

84
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:10,373
so if I go home, the war has
nothing to do with me, right?

85
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:13,106
Yeah, that's right.

86
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,889
Tomorrow is the solar eclipse...

87
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,389
When I return to the Institute,
Mr. Saito will no longer...

88
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,580
The kingdom of Tristein

89
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,817
has declined our kind
request to surrender.

90
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:22,411
Our proud warriors!

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,256
Under this holy light,

92
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:29,420
use your grand powers
to overwhelm Tristein!

93
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:34,861
What was that?!

94
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,736
A battleship has arrived at Talb...

95
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,533
They're already here?

96
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:45,533
Even if it costs my life,
I will have Talb back as ours!

97
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:48,673
May Bremir protect you.

98
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,060
Do you think it will fly?

99
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,995
I can't really put it to words,
but I can tell when I touch it.

100
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:07,928
It'll fly without any problems.

101
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:10,865
It's useful to be Gundolf.

102
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,562
I guess this is goodbye, darling.

103
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,765
But are you sure you're
all right with it?

104
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,808
You might never see
Louise again, you know.

105
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:24,916
Kirche...

106
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,551
Sorry to keep you waiting!

107
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,645
The dragon's blood...
Gasoline, was it?

108
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:33,558
I spent all night, and was able
to replicate this much...

109
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,150
Thank you so much, sir.

110
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,763
If everything was normal,

111
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:41,532
the entire Institute would see you off
with a grand ceremony, but...

112
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,802
No... I'd hate to ask for so much
at such a hard time.

113
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:47,672
The enemy army has already
planted a battleship

114
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,641
in the west end of Tristein,
in the village of Talb.

115
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,710
Who knows when they'll
reach this Institute...

116
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,346
Talb... You mean
Siesta's home village?!

117
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,682
Our army has already
begun its advance,

118
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,775
under the leadership of our princess.

119
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:01,745
Are you serious?!

120
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,023
I feel so much stronger

121
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:09,720
just by you being here
with me, Louise Françoise.

122
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,731
It's almost time for the solar eclipse...

123
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:14,663
Louise!

124
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:32,984
So I need to make this windmill spin?

125
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,285
Please!

126
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,287
It's reckless to head out
to the war zone!

127
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,856
What will you do if you break a wing?

128
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:40,591
You won't be able to
go home, you know?

129
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,959
I'll think about that
when the time comes!

130
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,895
Sir, please go for it!

131
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,328
All right!

132
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:04,849
Not good!

133
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,350
What's wrong, partner?

134
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,718
This is too short a distance!

135
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:09,879
At this rate, I'm going
to crash into the wall!

136
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:11,950
It's not flying...

137
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,252
Dammit!

138
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:18,862
Fly! Fly!

139
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,766
Now!

140
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,598
It really flew!

141
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,978
Tabitha, you...

142
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,743
Dangerous to be alone.

143
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:47,179
Sheesh... I can't just go home
all by myself, you know?!

144
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,067
This is fast! A dragon
can't even compare.

145
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:57,802
It's not just fast.

146
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,429
The bullets are still intact in here!

147
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,735
Just how fast is it?!
Even Sylpheed can't keep up!

148
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,460
Griffon squad, lure out the
enemy dragon knight squadron!

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,026
Magic Knights, rush the flagship
when that happens!

150
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,285
We must take the flagship
down at any cost!

151
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,946
Take it down?

152
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,156
But how would we...

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,901
Forward! Forward!

154
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,836
If we reach the ship's bottom,
they cannot fight back!

155
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,770
It looks like we don't have
a chance of winning.

156
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,404
Siesta, this way!

157
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:15,905
Hurry!

158
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,713
Lord Wales...

159
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:28,859
The sun!

160
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:29,826
Saito!

161
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,892
What is this sound?

162
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,496
I don't know.

163
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,774
The Robe of the Dragon!

164
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,343
What is that?!

165
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:49,835
That's the Robe of the Dragon!
What's the meaning of this?!

166
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,408
Mr. Saito?!

167
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,290
There sure are lots of them.

168
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,418
So horrible... What a riot!

169
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,996
I've never seen a dragon
like that before!

170
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,847
What power!

171
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:37,785
Gundolf!

172
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,364
Wardes, what is that?!

173
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,059
Leave it to me, your Excellency.

174
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,058
Matilda...

175
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:49,072
It looks like there is a need
for us to head out.

176
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,271
I've been waiting.

177
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:56,841
Oh, God!

178
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,474
Why? Why did you come?

179
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:04,979
That idiot!

180
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:08,259
Louise, where are you going?!

181
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,886
This is the last one!

182
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:12,429
All right!

183
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,987
Partner, eyes front!

184
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,832
It evaded!

185
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,507
This wind dragon has a much
higher speed than the fire dragons.

186
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:24,341
Wardes!

187
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,866
Unfortunately, it doesn't
have much attack power.

188
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:29,374
But my own power is
my greatest weapon!

189
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:32,979
Draw me, partner!

190
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:36,544
All right!

191
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:43,916
Gotcha!

192
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,922
Damn... out of ammo?

193
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,306
Even without dragons,
I can take care of all of you!

194
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,009
Even Fouquet?

195
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,567
This is the end!

196
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:07,346
Dammit, there's no contest
if I don't have a weapon!

197
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,055
What are you doing?!

198
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,250
If you don't hurry up, you
won't be able to go home!

199
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,357
Hi!

200
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,565
You guys...

201
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:31,232
Even Fouquet is here?
This is pretty troublesome.

202
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:35,946
What's this? We have
interesting folk here.

203
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:39,040
I'll take my vengeance from
the other day, all in one shot!

204
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:41,709
She found us!

205
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:46,090
Tabitha?

206
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,079
Alchemy...

207
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,685
I'm impressed that you didn't run.

208
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,963
Why would we turn our backs
to someone old like you?!

209
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,058
Calling me old?!

210
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:04,040
Guiche!

211
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:05,937
Okay.

212
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,654
Such a childish trick...

213
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:20,055
Flower petals, turn to oil! Alchemy!

214
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:23,959
Flame!

215
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:33,997
Dammit!

216
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:37,699
Hey! Wait!

217
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,408
Sylpheed! Why?

218
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,015
Tabitha!

219
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:55,559
At this rate...

220
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,753
This is...

221
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:09,695
Saito!

222
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:21,151
What are you doing, idiot!
That's dangerous!

223
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,088
And you're going off on your own,
being so selfish!

224
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,487
Who's the one that's being selfish?!

225
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:40,137
It's coming!

226
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,502
Tabitha, get away!

227
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,080
Why did you...

228
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,482
Because, because...

229
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:55,509
If you're facing danger,
I can't leave you alone!

230
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:58,188
Louise...

231
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,660
Gundolf!

232
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,431
This time, for sure, I will
bury you and that legend!

233
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:11,299
Legends, nobles, peasants,
they all mean nothing to me!

234
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:14,371
The only thing going for me
is to protect her...

235
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:16,171
I have nothing else!

236
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,168
I am the Familiar of Zero!

237
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,142
Saito...

238
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:23,273
Saito... Saito...

239
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:25,442
Saito!

240
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,227
What...

241
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,697
It's finally here!

242
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:42,096
Wake up, Louise!

243
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,769
You, the master of Gundolf...

244
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,470
...are a user of Void!

245
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:57,443
Idiot! Stay seated!

246
00:18:58,148 --> 00:18:59,683
She finally got connected?

247
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:00,784
Connected?

248
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:04,811
Void magic takes time to cast.
Buy her some time, partner!

249
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,280
That's what Gundolf is for!

250
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,135
Dammit!

251
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:32,444
This is the power of the Void?

252
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:45,562
This light...

253
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:46,927
Mr. Saito...

254
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,602
Hold out for just a little bit longer!

255
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,550
The solar eclipse is ending?

256
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:32,867
I can't believe it!
That Louise the Zero?!

257
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:40,784
I still have enough power if
I can return to the mainland.

258
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,751
You...

259
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:46,280
With this brilliance,
become my prisoner!

260
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,792
What is this?

261
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:54,957
Andvari's Ring.

262
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,869
Then, that thing that the
Water Spirit said was stolen...

263
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,769
Someone!

264
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,409
As long as I have this, nobody can...

265
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,509
Fouquet got away.

266
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,384
So, who is this guy?

267
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:25,619
Oh, you're up?

268
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:30,331
Didn't I say you were fired?

269
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,327
I can't read this world's writing.

270
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,542
And you made a mess
out of that Robe too...

271
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,676
What are you going to do?

272
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:42,270
Well, I can't help things
that have already happened.

273
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,447
Idiot! Stupid dog!

274
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,764
All right?

275
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:03,699
This is a sign that we have
a new contract.

276
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:26,582
As if I were under a real magic spell

277
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:37,624
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

278
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:49,479
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

279
00:22:49,479 --> 00:23:00,413
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

280
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:12,364
My true feelings, the
shards of loneliness

281
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:23,402
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

282
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,486
For the day to start from zero

283
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:32,478
You dog!
