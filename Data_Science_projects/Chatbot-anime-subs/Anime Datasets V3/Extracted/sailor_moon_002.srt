1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,405
What's worse than old men who are
envious of youth and popularity,

2
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:11,863
are those that think nothing
of peoples' feelings.

3
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:18,142
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short
sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

6
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,620
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

8
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,568
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

9
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

10
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

12
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,483
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,348
I'm a Cancer. My blood type is O and
my birthstone is the pearl.

15
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:05,151
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

16
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,164
One day, a strange black cat
named Luna appeared

17
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,496
and made me into a sailor warrior.

18
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:15,761
But she wants me to fight bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:20,435
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:31,750
Punish Them!
The House of Fortune is the Monster Mansion

21
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:38,928
Hurry! Hurry!

22
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:39,595
Wait for me!
Hurry! Hurry!

23
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:40,323
Wait for me!

24
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,044
This place is really good.

25
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:58,013
I know, it's been on TV a few times.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,448
Wow, look at the line.

27
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,012
Foolish humans.

28
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,688
What? You still haven't found the
legendary silver crystal?

29
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,456
No.

30
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:20,161
Hurry. Our great ruler is waiting
for a lot of energy.

31
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,369
Leave it to us.

32
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,703
Is that you, Jadeite?

33
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,397
Yes.

34
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:31,714
As you heard, we still have not found
the legendary silver crystal.

35
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:34,740
So I want human energy instead.

36
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:38,043
Queen Beryl, it has already
been taken care of.

37
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,896
Wake up!

38
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,032
Come on!

39
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,906
There.

40
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,014
I can't breathe.

41
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,983
You won't be able to succeed
in our mission like that.

42
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:12,915
Good!

43
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,921
Look at the time!

44
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,126
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

45
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,494
Gurio Umino.

46
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,899
Here.

47
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:33,698
Um. Kenji Oota.

48
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,077
Here.

49
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,510
Takayuki Kamikawa.

50
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,213
Here.

51
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,381
Yuuji Kimura.

52
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,683
Here.

53
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,947
Good morning, Usagi!

54
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,883
Go stand in the hallway!

55
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,617
Why are you out here with me?

56
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:57,688
That's... Well... It's hard to explain...

57
00:04:59,034 --> 00:04:59,935
Weirdo.

58
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,536
Yes.
Weirdo.

59
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,161
Yes.

60
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:09,011
What did you want to talk
to me about?

61
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,605
I want to go on a date with Usagi.

62
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:13,582
And trade dairies and even talk to
her parents about the future.

63
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:16,415
..Mom.. ..Dad..
And trade dairies and even talk to
her parents about the future.

64
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:16,813
And trade dairies and even talk to
her parents about the future.

65
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:20,578
That'll never happen.

66
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:27,259
I'm sorry, I don't think it'll work if you
come straight out and ask.

67
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,933
So I should attack her from behind?

68
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,368
No, no.

69
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:35,394
Go to a fortune teller and ask her
what you should do.

70
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,272
I already know the answer then.

71
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:43,272
This fortune teller game was made
according to my ideas.

72
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:48,081
According to this, Usagi and I are
supposed to get married.

73
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:49,743
Thank you.

74
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:50,619
The Happy Couple
Thank you.

75
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:50,914
The Happy Couple

76
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:54,584
I don't mean that.
I mean a real fortune teller.

77
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,956
I see.

78
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:00,487
There's a fortune teller house
that opened in Juubangai.

79
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,399
I heard that they are pretty good,
so why don't you try them?

80
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,661
Okay.

81
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,803
Huh?

82
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:19,575
What happened? There is
usually a long line here.

83
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,711
I guess it's because there is
competition now. Look.

84
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:29,083
House of Fortune

85
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:30,926
It's awfully gaudy.

86
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,361
What is that?

87
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,863
The beauty from Juubangai.

88
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:38,300
What? Is it the same kind of
fortune telling that you do?

89
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,259
Yeah. Everyone likes new things.

90
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:45,541
Read me.

91
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,041
Okay, thank you.
Read me.

92
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,531
Okay, thank you.

93
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,046
There's a man that likes you right now.

94
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:56,443
And it's someone you see all the time.

95
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,085
Someone I always see...

96
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,057
Maybe it's...

97
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,535
Looks like he's not here yet.

98
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,797
Hey, Usagi.

99
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:25,013
Perfect timing. I'm about
to start working.

100
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,277
Hello, Motoki.

101
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,580
Usagi, the Sailor V Game
just came in.

102
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,616
You haven't played it yet, right?

103
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:34,248
Not yet.

104
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:39,393
C'mon! C'mon! There, there!
C'mon! C'mon!

105
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:42,092
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

106
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,429
Oh, game over!

107
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,473
It's pretty hard, isn't it?

108
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,701
Uh... yes.

109
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,009
I'll show you how to do it.

110
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:56,835
Oh I'II...

111
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:00,114
My treat. Here Usagi, watch carefully.

112
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,408
See, at this point, you have to
get this item.

113
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,622
See, and you kill it.

114
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:07,189
Makes me nervous but I'm so happy.
See, and you kill it.

115
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,890
Makes me nervous but I'm so happy.

116
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,391
Makes me nervous but I'm so happy.
See? You understand now?

117
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:09,791
See? You understand now?

118
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,089
The rest you just keep shooting.

119
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,138
Luna, what are you doing here?

120
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:25,374
Oh, is this cat's name Luna?

121
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,842
Huh? Yeah.

122
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:30,369
It's been around here lately.
I wonder if it's a stray?

123
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,915
What are you doing?

124
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:39,349
Stop it. Okay, I'm going! I'm going!

125
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:43,519
Well, bye!

126
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,884
Oh but, we're still in the
middle of the game.

127
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,663
I'll come again.

128
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:48,964
I'll be waiting.

129
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:52,229
I feel good every time
I see your face.

130
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,740
We were having a good time!

131
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,609
Is it okay for you to stop somewhere
on your way home?

132
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:12,342
Well, it's not a good thing.

133
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,623
As long as you understand.

134
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,649
Like I told you this morning, Usagi,
you have a mission.

135
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,386
Where are you going?

136
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,292
I'm going to have the old man
tell me more about Motoki.

137
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,529
I was too late.

138
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:43,008
I should probably wait and ask the
old man from Juubangai.

139
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,721
But I want to know right now.

140
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,756
Usagi, what are you doing?

141
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,958
Never mind, never mind.

142
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,325
Oh, I know. I'll tell my own fortune
on which one I should go to.

143
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,165
If it's right side up,
I'll ask the old man.

144
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,032
If it's upside down, I'll go to
the House of Fortune.

145
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:04,433
Ow!

146
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,900
Oops.

147
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,507
It's that smug guy again.

148
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,783
That hurts, Dumpling Head.

149
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:16,418
Is that all you can say?

150
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:19,876
You'll never have a boyfriend if
you don't act more ladylike.

151
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,856
Well, thank you so much!

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,662
My good mood's all gone.

153
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:42,471
How irritating.

154
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,963
Amazing...

155
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,471
Look at my eyes.

156
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:27,150
You are a wonderful servant of evil.

157
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,986
You can do whatever you desire.

158
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:34,753
I will do whatever I desire.

159
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,034
I will soon be able to
collect the energy.

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,195
Hey! Usagi!

161
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:18,769
Oh, Dad. Shopping?

162
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,510
Yeah, I got home early for a change
and your mom got me.

163
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,205
Dad, you're so sweet.

164
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,145
I leave all the housework
to your mom.

165
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,242
This is the least I can do.

166
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:35,723
I bet Motoki will be like Dad.

167
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:36,858
By the way Usagi...

168
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:37,124
Huh?
By the way Usagi...

169
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:37,625
Huh?

170
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,125
Huh?
What were you doing out until now?

171
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,527
What were you doing out until now?

172
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,362
It's not good to be hanging out
after school.

173
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,795
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,024
Usagi, what is with the cat?

175
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,271
It seems like it's following us.

176
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,136
Oh, it's my friend.

177
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,075
You have some strange friends.

178
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,582
Did Umino say anything to you?

179
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,149
About what?

180
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,990
I think Umino likes you.

181
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,287
What?!

182
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,894
But he's innocent so he's
too shy to say anything.

183
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,828
Usagi, let's go on a date!

184
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,333
What's wrong?

185
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,903
It's not a good idea to come to
school dressed like that.

186
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:24,939
Who cares? Usagi, let's go
on a date today.

187
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,304
You know...

188
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:29,274
He's gotten brave all of the sudden.

189
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:32,373
Umino, what is that outfit?

190
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,074
Umino! What are you thinking?

191
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,487
Thinking this!

192
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:57,800
No one will marry me now!

193
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,077
That is enough!

194
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:17,425
What are you doing, Yuuji?

195
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,792
Ms. Haruna, you are supposed to
walk quietly in the classroom.

196
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,858
What did you say?

197
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,329
What? Umino went to the
House of Fortune?

198
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:35,372
Yeah. I told him about it.
I think Yuuji went too.

199
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,277
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

200
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,288
You don't have much of a brain.

201
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:48,723
So stop acting like you're
better than us!

202
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:49,323
Yeah! Yeah!
So stop acting like you're
better than us!

203
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,017
Yeah! Yeah!

204
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,487
Take that! And that and that!

205
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,067
Keep on making trouble.

206
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,647
The rebellious energy of the young.

207
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,724
What are you doing?

208
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,026
What is this?

209
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,516
Hey, Usagi!

210
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,556
What's wrong with you?

211
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,188
Wanna kiss?

212
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,637
I don't like you when you're like this!

213
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,045
I hate you! Hate you! Hate you!

214
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,408
Let's get out of here.

215
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,218
I feel some kind of evil energy.

216
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,523
Usagi, it's okay now.

217
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,658
Oh, I feel better.

218
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,897
Umino and the others just left.
What was he thinking?

219
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:15,474
Usagi, it seems something evil has
been causing these incidents.

220
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,434
So, Umino and the others...

221
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,914
They are probably being controlled.

222
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:22,280
The House of Fortune is suspicious.

223
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,021
The guys have been weird since they
went to the House of Fortune.

224
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,223
That's great! Good job finding that out.

225
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,953
Give me a new item as a reward.

226
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,928
In your dreams! Let's go.

227
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,398
What? Fight again?

228
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:38,865
I'm kind of scared.

229
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,864
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,343
Transform into Sailor Moon.

231
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,073
Do I have to?

232
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,945
You have to.

233
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,317
Let's see.

234
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,615
I forgot what I'm supposed to say.

235
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,019
It's "Moon Prism Power Makeup"!

236
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,056
Oh, that's it!

237
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:12,964
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

238
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,611
Everyone, you did very well.

239
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,283
Now, I'll have you wreak
havoc in town.

240
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:02,883
Yes!

241
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:03,551
Sounds like fun!
Yes!

242
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,485
Sounds like fun!

243
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:07,621
What's worse than old men being
envious of youth and popularity,

244
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,648
are those that think nothing of
peoples' feelings.

245
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,382
Who's there?

246
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,294
Sailor warrior of love and justice.

247
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,895
Sailor Moon!

248
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,199
Sailor Moon?

249
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,166
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you.

250
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,785
Hey, watch it!

251
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,454
You don't have time for that.

252
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,785
Oh, yeah.

253
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,590
Get her!

254
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:53,232
Stop this!

255
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,294
No!

256
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,033
If you get any closer,
you're going to get hurt.

257
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,125
Another intruder?

258
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,922
Who's there?

259
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,860
Tuxedo Mask!

260
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:33,636
Don't ever give up no matter
how hard it is.

261
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,405
Okay.

262
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,111
Good-bye! We'll meet again.

263
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,572
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask.

264
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,596
That would have hurt.

265
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:58,032
C'mon, Sailor Moon, the tiara!

266
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,465
Oh yeah.

267
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:30,491
Moon Tiara Action.

268
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:56,181
Bam, you failed.

269
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,790
Yay!

270
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,932
Take care!

271
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:16,039
What?! I flipped Ms. Haruna's skirt?

272
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,315
And you tried to kiss Usagi.

273
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:24,307
Then you broke the window
of the teacher's office...

274
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,144
Hey, where are you going?

275
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:33,049
All that's left for me is misery.

276
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,757
Good morning!

277
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:39,798
Usagi. Uh... about yesterday...

278
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:42,095
Don't worry about it!

279
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,038
You're right! I shouldn't
worry about it.

280
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,143
You're okay when you get bad grades
on your tests after all.

281
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,077
I need to be more like you.

282
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,548
Sheesh! He doesn't even know
the trouble I go through.

283
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:57,944
Oh no.

284
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:13,501
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

285
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:20,134
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

286

Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

287

Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

Anata dake ki ni naru

289

Motto kirei ni ima sugu naritai

290

Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne

291

Me o tojite tashikamete
