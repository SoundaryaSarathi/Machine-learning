1
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,484
“This is a weird feeling.

2
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:33,521
As if looking through a binocular,

3
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:35,992
everything is small,” said Alice.

4
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,853
That’s right.

5
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:42,194
Alice who had become
about 10 inches tall,

6
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,898
her face lit up

7
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,602
when she discovered than
she can now walk through the small door

8
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:49,503
which leads her to a
beautiful garden on the other side.

9
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,446
Shortly, from a distance

10
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:56,142
there were footsteps

11
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:59,252
which grabbed Alice’s attention.

12
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,014
There she found a white rabbit
who was dressed up

13
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:05,719
with one hand in a white glove

14
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:09,453
and the other holding
a large pocket watch,

15
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:11,689
talking to himself

16
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:14,329
and running in a hurry.

17
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:17,831
“Oh the Queen…

18
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,664
I made the Queen wait like this

19
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:23,134
I’m in trouble,” cried the rabbit.

20
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:27,108
As it went by,

21
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,274
Alice started a conversation by saying

22
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,808
“Excuse me”

23
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,115
in a tiny muttering voice.

24
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,821
Use it as a bookmark.

25
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:44,562
Eriol-kun.

26
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:51,638
[Sakura and the Sakura in Wonderland]

27
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:55,104
Sakura-san,

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,872
what are you reading?

29
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,937
– This.
– Oh, Alice?

30
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:01,904
Yeah,

31
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,578
have you read it?

32
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,608
Yeah,

33
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,515
quite a while ago.

34
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:10,721
Isn’t it fun? Becoming little

35
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,651
and then big and all.
But it spells trouble.

36
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:22,094
Don’t come any closer!

37
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:29,342
Didn’t know my bathroom was this big…

38
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,674
Hoeee!! Don’t come any closer!

39
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:44,483
What’s wrong?

40
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,458
Oh it’s nothing.

41
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:51,258
Ahh, this is an English fairy tale

42
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,796
from where you used to live, right?

43
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:54,965
Yeah.

44
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,301
What’s England like?

45
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,598
Many days, it either rains or is foggy,

46
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,197
but I like it

47
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:02,643
because the old buildings
are still around.

48
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:04,739
Really?

49
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:08,882
There are many gardens and buildings

50
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,375
as illustrated in the book in real life.

51
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:11,683
Amazing!

52
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,587
Wow… I want to go there.

53
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:22,027
Shall I take you there?

54
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,798
To Alice’s wonderland…

55
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,841
Ahh… you can feel the love in the air…

56
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:41,478
Alice’s wonderland

57
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,474
must be England, right

58
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,143
Does that mean that Hiiragizawa-kun

59
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:49,488
is willing to introduce
Sakura-chan to his family?

60
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,052
Introducing someone to their family

61
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,327
is definitely…

62
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,723
You’re getting more and more jealous!

63
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,727
Home Room is starting!

64
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:06,502
Ok, thanks.

65
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:19,245
Reading week is almost at an end.

66
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:20,883
Can everyone

67
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:22,516
finish reading the books they chose?

68
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:24,116
Yes.

69
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,898
What a huge book.

70
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:36,163
It’s really interesting.

71
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,897
Do you want to read it too

72
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,538
Eh… but I haven’t

73
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,206
even finished reading this book.

74
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,811
and I read slow…

75
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:52,012
Wow… Yanagisawa… amazing.

76
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:53,383
Yes.

77
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,086
Oh you don’t say.

78
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,287
I liked this book myself.

79
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,253
Is that right?

80
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,060
I’ll be looking forward
to your book report.

81
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,493
Ok everyone has

82
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,033
to write a report upon

83
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,531
finishing reading their books.

84
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:13,972
Yes!

85
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:24,348
What should I do?
Want to stop by somewhere on the way?

86
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,380
Naoko-chan,
what about your piano lessons?

87
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,811
There isn’t much to do today.

88
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:29,936
What about you Rika-chan?

89
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:33,653
I’m going to the library
to finish reading this.

90
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:34,952
Then

91
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:37,296
should we all go to
the library and read?

92
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,027
Is that ok?

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,627
I want to finish
this book up soon too.

94
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,094
– Yeah.
– Ok then, let’s go.

95
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,700
Then shall I read another book?

96
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:52,637
I’m glad that

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,911
Tereda-sensei happens to like that book.

98
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:57,109
Yeah.

99
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,221
Eriol-kun!

100
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,260
Are you going too?

101
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,858
– Yes.
– Then do you want to go with us?

102
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:11,562
Ok, sounds good.

103
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,479
What are you reading,
Yamazaki-kun?

104
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:33,175
Alien transformed into a cat
and is targetting Earth?

105
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:37,385
– What’s that…
– I’ve read it before.

106
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:40,325
Wasn’t it fun?

107
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,089
But do you think it’s for real?

108
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:44,428
Cats who really are aliens.

109
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,867
It’s really true. Right now

110
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:49,300
2/3 of the cats

111
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:50,670
on Earth alone are aliens

112
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,337
On top of that
from space not just cats

113
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,266
but other forms like dogs or chickens

114
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,006
or penguins and other various
forms come to earth each year,

115
00:06:57,378 --> 00:07:02,475
about 7000 of them every year

116
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,817
I wonder if there are such things
are goldfish aliens.

117
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:05,843
Of course!

118
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,615
It was thought for the goldfish alien

119
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,348
because they had to travel
with their suits

120
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:11,688
filled with water.

121
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,549
Small body,

122
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,718
but the space suit

123
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,291
are tens of kilometers in length.

124
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,392
Wow amazing.

125
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,367
And, that it is a famous story

126
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,638
that the octopus is an alien

127
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,052
You’re working hard.

128
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:42,447
Hong Kong and Japan
may have same Kanji characters

129
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,118
but the pronunciation
and the meaning could differ so.

130
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,792
I guess so.

131
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:51,827
Eriol-kun, you can read

132
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,929
without dictionaries?

133
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:56,462
Sort of.

134
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:59,066
Did you study Japanese?

135
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,799
– Yes.
– Wasn’t it tough?

136
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,771
I’m quite used to it

137
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:06,044
since there were people
who used Japanese around me.

138
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,741
Did you have Japanese
friends in England?

139
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,007
No.

140
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,877
Hoe? Then how…

141
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:16,545
I had some business a while ago…

142
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,958
I’ll go and return this.

143
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,030
Doesn’t Li-kun look angry?

144
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,241
Men are complicated.

145
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:51,887
Sakura-chan!

146
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,161
What’s wrong?

147
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,758
It’s nothing.

148
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:02,696
What’s wrong?

149
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:06,095
Sakura-chan
got sucked into the book.

150
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,963
What?

151
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,610
I can feel strong magic…

152
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:19,641
What do we do?

153
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,080
Hoe? These clothes.

154
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,858
Tomoyo-chan!

155
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,862
Where is this place

156
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,300
I was reading a book
at the library just now…

157
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,374
Then…

158
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:20,503
what else happened again?

159
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,643
I know… am I inside the book?

160
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,548
That’s right!

161
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:30,812
Over here!

162
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:36,192
Eriol-kun!

163
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:38,823
No, I’m the Cheshire cat!

164
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,364
Cheshire cat…

165
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:42,895
as in from…
Alice in Wonderland?

166
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:43,835
Yes.

167
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,972
Ahh… I got it! This must be a dream!

168
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,104
You’re wrong!

169
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,171
Then?

170
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,113
Eriol-kun doing something like that…

171
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:05,957
this is definitely a dream.

172
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:09,460
It isn’t. I actually like

173
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,697
to fool around a lot

174
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,564
Is that so?

175
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:15,660
But I have a tought time

176
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,432
trying to restrain myself

177
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:21,635
from being dragged into
you and Li-kun’s level.

178
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,479
My… level.

179
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,773
Yes.

180
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:34,077
Then why are you
so serious around me all the time?

181
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,183
Because there are people around you

182
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,992
who know my real self.

183
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,391
I can’t be revealed just yet.

184
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:43,491
Eh?

185
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,994
Well then… please take your time

186
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:49,732
in enjoying

187
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:53,004
– Alice’s wonderland in this book.
– Wait!

188
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:00,476
What should I do.

189
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:03,442
If this really is inside the book,

190
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,475
then I need to figure out
how to get out of here…

191
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:13,516
Must hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry…

192
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,324
Yukito-san!

193
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:18,631
No, I’m the rabbit.
(Yukito -> snow-rabbit -> rabbit)

194
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,992
Oh, I’m going to be late,
if I don’t hurry.

195
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:25,530
Where are you going?

196
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:27,604
Where the Queen is at.

197
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:33,545
Rabbit who is on his way
to the Queen in a hurry…

198
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,910
this is definitely Alice’s wonderland
in the book.

199
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,512
Must hurry, hurry…

200
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:43,721
Please wait! Wait!

201
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:44,817
That’s right…

202
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,436
Um… Yue-san?

203
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:10,549
It’s faster if I fly.

204
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:31,161
We’re here.

205
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:46,980
Sakura-chan.

206
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,022
It’s no use.

207
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,159
Huh? Where is Sakura-chan?

208
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,931
She went back to the classroom to
get something that she’d forgot.

209
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:02,997
Whew…

210
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:18,809
Brother?

211
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:21,819
I am the Mad Hatter.

212
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,128
Drink it?

213
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,338
Yes.

214
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:51,875
It’s good. That was good!

215
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:53,810
Oh wait,

216
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,216
if this is Alice’s wonderland,

217
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:58,623
then there may be potions to shrink me.

218
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,316
I better watch what I’m drinking.

219
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,387
Or it will be very troublesome.

220
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:05,556
So?

221
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,129
You just drank

222
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:10,001
the potion to shrink yourself

223
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:29,883
Li-kun! Thank you!

224
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,897
Hoe???? Why are there two of Li-kun!

225
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:47,739
I am Twiddle-Dum. I Twiddle-Dee.

226
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,509
Umm… hey Li-kun…

227
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,571
Do you know
how to get out of this world?

228
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:58,346
Do you want to know?

229
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,950
If you solve this riddle
then I’ll tell you.

230
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:07,251
Ok! Here is the question.

231
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,022
I have someone that I like.

232
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,053
I don’t have anyone that I like.

233
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,295
Which one?

234
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,065
Do you want this dumpling? Here…

235
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,703
Li-kun likes Yukito-san…

236
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,777
so… Yes!

237
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,581
Bing-bong! Correct!

238
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,386
Last Question

239
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,320
The person I like is taller than me.

240
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,091
The person I like is shorter than me.

241
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:42,218
Which one?

242
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:52,795
Since Yukito-san is taller…

243
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,266
TALLER!
Boo! Wrong!

244
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:58,404
How come?

245
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,642
But Yukito-san is taller than Li-kun!

246
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,881
It’s not Yukito-san?

247
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,612
Dissapeared…

248
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:13,389
I have to get out of this world!

249
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:15,619
But when I’m this small

250
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:18,189
finding the exit is going to be tough

251
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,255
Oh that’s right

252
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:23,627
Here it is!

253
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,399
Oh Key that hids the power of the stars,

254
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,935
reveal you true form before me.

255
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:37,048
I Sakura command

256
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:41,379
Release!

257
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,432
Please… change…

258
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:06,174
Oh card created by Clow… 
lose your form and be reborn…

259
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,240
I command you…

260
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:12,018
BIG!

261
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:15,613
I did it! Hoeee!!!

262
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,257
I’m too big

263
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,341
What? A Leaf?

264
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,343
I’ve got to return to my original size.

265
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,512
Oh card created by Clow…

266
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:49,017
lose your form and be reborn…

267
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,619
I command you…

268
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,360
LITTLE!

269
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:06,694
Hoe? Where am I?

270
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,173
On the Chess board.

271
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:12,876
Tomoyo-chan.

272
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,174
I am Humpty-Dumpty.

273
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:18,809
I am in the middle of a chess game.

274
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,651
Hoe? With whom?

275
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:28,956
Kero-chan!

276
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,261
Kero-chan,

277
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,465
do you know

278
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:37,302
how I can get out of this book?

279
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,799
I am not Kero-chan.

280
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,942
You have interrupted my chess game.

281
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:47,712
Kero-chan…

282
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,177
I am not Kero-chan.

283
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:53,611
I am the Queen!

284
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,048
What’s going on, Kero-chan!

285
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,322
Call me your majesty!

286
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:08,090
Wait! I’m not done with you yet!

287
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,335
Ahh! Eriol-kun!

288
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,865
I am the Cheshire cat.

289
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,041
Even in the book,
Cheshire cat knew a lot…

290
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:19,609
Please tell me

291
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,913
how can I get out of this book?

292
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:25,242
There’s only one way out.

293
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:26,274
In other words,

294
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:29,246
you just have to find
the way you came in.

295
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:31,312
Huh? Where is the entrance?

296
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:34,090
You should know it.

297
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:37,128
Where?

298
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:38,931
Where did I come
into the book through?

299
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,061
That’s it! The leaf bookmark!

300
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,069
FLY!

301
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,074
Are you not going to listen to me?!

302
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,292
Sakura-chan!

303
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:12,691
Are you ok?

304
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,491
I barely escaped…

305
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,238
Sorry…

306
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:28,672
It changed…

307
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,844
WHat is it?

308
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,548
It’s nothing.

309
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,259
Thank you.

310
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:51,929
You saved me.
