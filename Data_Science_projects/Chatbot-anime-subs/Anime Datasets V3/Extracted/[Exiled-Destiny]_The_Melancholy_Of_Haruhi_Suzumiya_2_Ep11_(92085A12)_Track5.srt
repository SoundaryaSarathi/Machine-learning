1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,209
What should I do?

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,379
Oh, you don't have
to do anything.

3
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:09,389
You can go home.
We're done for today.

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:16,259
It looks like our Haruhi-esque activities
are done for the day.

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,989
She was able to get her hands
on all of this stuff,

6
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:21,329
and with the kind of skill that could even
get an experienced negotiator to lean left.

7
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,599
On top of that, it all cost nothing.
In other words, it was free.

8
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,539
They used to say this a lot
in the old days:

9
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,639
"There's nothing scarier than
something that's free."

10
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:32,009
The problem is that Haruhi
isn't scared at all.

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,019
Actually, if there is something that would
scare Haruhi, please, let me know.

12
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:52,299
DAY BY DAY unzari dayone dakara
Day by day, everything's just so dull

That's why you need to become

Oh my boy, you need to be decisive

15
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,249

I found myself on my own,
it's natural you'd fall for me

17
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,259

Kick away the boring ways
of doing things,

00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,919

I'm going to decide everything

Surpass (Don't you stop me)
The idea of "impossible"

Fukanou (DON'T YOU STOP ME)

Of course, it'll feel pleasant,

Everything's a new experience,
what about it?

31
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,709
What's all that?
Presents for good little kids?

32
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,779
What, this?
Of course not.

33
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,319
Oh, model guns. I didn't know
you were into those.

34
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,619
I'm not.
These are Haruhi's.

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,099
Huh, Suzumiya's...
Well, it must be tough.

36
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,999
By the way.

37
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,369
What?

38
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,799
Well, the school festival
is coming soon, right?

39
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,409
What are you guys going
to do this time?

40
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,839
Why ask me?

41
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,739
I don't think I'd get a serious
response if I asked Suzumiya.

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,909
Nagato wouldn't say anything
if I asked her,

43
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,809
and Miss Asahina
won't come near me.

44
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,389
And the other guy...
is kind of creepy.

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,949
That's why
I'm asking you.

46
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,759
What, am I the P.R. Rep now,
or am I just a nice guy?

47
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,659
It's the latter, definitely.

48
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:02,559
I mean, you seem like the kind of
guy that will stick with someone,

49
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,539
even if you know that the path
you're taking is leading to a cliff.

50
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,469
I'm hurt. Fine, I won't tell you
when I find out, then.

51
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,679
Hey!

52
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,179
Even I know that what awaits us at
the end of Haruhi's little path

53
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,109
is going to be pointless.

54
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:23,349
But it isn't just Haruhi and me
walking down that path.

55
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,749
There are at least three others
coming along with us.

56
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,689
I'm sure two of them would be fine
if left to their own devices,

57
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,989
but Miss Asahina
would be in danger.

58
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,529
For someone from the future,
she sure doesn't seem to be able

59
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,159
to predict any of the problems
that might happen to her.

60
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,739
It's obvious to me that I
have to protect her.

61
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,309
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya II
It's obvious to me that I
have to protect her.

62
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,469
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya II

63
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,109
Hurry up and get undressed!
I'll help.

64
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,419
O-Oh no, please,
don't pull-

65
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:56,749
Come on!

66
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,289
Come in.

67
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,529
Well?

68
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,659
It really suits her,
oddly enough.

69
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,359
I thought that it was of Caean make
or something.

70
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,529
Hello!

71
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,339
Oh, excuse me.

72
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,409
Oh my. That looks
quite good on you.

73
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,609
You can tell that just
by looking at her.

74
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:26,009
What I can't tell is why there's
a waitress in here,

75
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,019
since this isn't a cafe
or anything.

76
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,379
Well, you see...

77
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,849
Mikuru is going to wear
this costume in the movie!

78
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:37,329
Is her usual maid outfit
not good enough?

79
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,449
Of course not.

80
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:43,629
A maid is a person that gives private service
to someone in a mansion somewhere.

81
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,129
But waitresses
are different.

82
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,869
They work at restaurants where they
provide their services to the public.

83
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,839
That's no reason to put
Miss Asahina in this outfit.

84
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,509
Never mind the details! This is
just a question of atmosphere.

85
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,169
And it's fine
with me!

86
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,809
Even if it's fine with you,
is it fine with Miss Asahina?

87
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:03,919
Umm...

88
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,849
T-This feels like
it's a bit small for me...

89
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,119
S-So, you see...

90
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,629
It's all right! This is just right.
It's like a perfect fit.

91
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,929
It's no use.
She's made her decision.

92
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:20,999
In other words, this is
our movie's concept!

93
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,929
I decided to dedicate myself
to entertainment

94
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,199
as the representative director
for the SOS Brigade!

95
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,779
Just watch! We'll get a standing ovation,
we'll leave no one in their seats!

96
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,479
Director
Just watch! We'll get a standing ovation,
we'll leave no one in their seats!

97
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,929
Yuki! You understand, don't you!
That's it!

98
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,299
I don't know if
that's "it."

99
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,299
It looks like her costume for
her class's fortune telling.

100
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,599
Based on the answers Nagato gave
to Haruhi's rapid-fire questions,

101
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,009
that seems to be
the case.

102
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:06,409
In any case, what was she up to,
walking here like that?

103
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,679
That costume is perfect for
the role I have in mind.

104
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,689
What do you mean, perfect?

105
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,819
This!

106
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,329
Is... is this my fault?

107
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,529
Mikuru - Fighting waitress from the future
Koizumi - Teenage esper
Yuki - Evil alien
Is... is this my fault?

108
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,299
Mikuru - Fighting waitress from the future
Koizumi - Teenage esper
Yuki - Evil alien

109
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,589
How can I put this?

110
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,969
It's really the kind of casting I'd
expect from you, Miss Suzumiya.

111
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,539
It's wonderful.

112
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:35,909
Don't smile at me.
I'll turn to stone.

113
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,339
I'm sorry...

114
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,819
Okay, Kyon! Get those guns ready
to be used by the end of the day.

115
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,149
We're going to start
shooting tomorrow, after all.

116
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,159
Oh, you have to learn how to
handle a camera, got it?

117
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,429
Do you think we're going to have
any particular problems?

118
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,869
Have we ever NOT had any problems
with anything she's done?

119
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,729
Don't make me laugh.

120
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:04,139
Well, it's not really a laughing matter,
but it's not a reason to despair, either.

121
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,899
How do you
know that?

122
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,169
Because those are
movie roles.

123
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:14,049
There's no way that Miss Suzumiya actually
believes that I'm a teenage esper.

124
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,589
The "Itsuki Koizumi" that I'm set to
play in the fiction of the movie

125
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,589
is an esper, that's all.

126
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,529
No one actually mixes up an actor with the
character they play in a movie, right?

127
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,639
Even if there are people who do,
Miss Suzumiya is not one of them.

128
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,769
That still doesn't
make me feel better.

129
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,539
There's no proof that what
you're saying is true.

130
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:44,069
If she was the kind of person that
would mix up the real world with fiction,

131
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,109
then our world would already be
a much more fantastic place.

132
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,879
I've said this before,
but Miss Suzumiya

133
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,679
actually has a fairly realistic
way of thinking.

134
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,259
I know that. I've been pulled
into numerous odd situations

135
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:03,469
because her realistic way of thinking sort
of ambles into her godlike existence.

136
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:03,799
Brigade leader

137
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,829
Brigade leader
On top of that, Haruhi doesn't
know she's doing it.

138
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,579
We can't show Miss Suzumiya
any proof of this, of course.

139
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:18,409
There might come a time where we
have to, but this is not that time.

140
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,449
Thankfully, Miss Asahina and
Miss Nagato are in agreement with us.

141
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,689
I'd be okay if things stayed
this way forever, though.

142
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,519
So would I. I don't want to
see the world go to pieces.

143
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,899
I think you should be more worried
about yourself than the world.

144
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,199
There are replacements for
myself and Miss Nagato,

145
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,999
but there's no
understudy for you.

146
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,039
For the school festival
Practice file 3

147
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:58,589
Feh, what's the big deal about the
school festival? It pisses me off.

148
00:08:58,689 --> 00:08:59,749
Why?

149
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,879
I'm not having
any fun at all,

150
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:04,859
so the people who are having fun
are a real eyesore.

151
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,989
Especially couples, they fill me
with "murderous intent".

152
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,589
Isn't that just you
resenting them?

153
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,329
And what's with our class?
A survey? Hah! How stupid.

154
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:19,609
Then you should have
come up with an idea.

155
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,739
If you had, then maybe Haruhi wouldn't
have come up with this movie idea.

156
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:27,509
As if. There's no way I'd let them
push me into doing more.

157
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,179
That's true. If only
Miss Asakura were still here.

158
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:38,059
It really sucked to have a
double A-plus class girl leave.

159
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,259
I wonder if they'd let me
change classes now.

160
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,529
Which class would you want to go to?
Maybe Miss Nagato's class?

161
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,769
Oh yeah, I saw her walking around in
some kind of magician outfit yesterday.

162
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:50,069
What was that
all about?

163
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,939
Who knows?
I sure don't.

164
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,809
Hm, when was it that I saw you and Nagato
in the classroom in each other's arms?

165
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,209
Well, you see...

166
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,249
I know, it was something
Suzumiya cooked up, right?

167
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,349
What? Y-Yeah...

168
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,389
This was an attempt to freak me out, right?
Nice try, but no dice.
Taniguchi misunderstanding what happened
is a load off of my shoulders...

169
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:09,489
This was an attempt to freak me out, right?
Nice try, but no dice.

170
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,159
This was an attempt to freak me out, right?
Nice try, but no dice.
Thanks, Taniguchi.
Your stupidity will save the world.

171
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,619
Thanks, Taniguchi.
Your stupidity will save the world.

172
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,419
Man, but this
is boring.

173
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,289
Okay, everyone! We're heading
to the first location!

174
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,599
This is sudden.

175
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,829
I looked for a good place
around the school,

176
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,769
but it looks like we have no choice
but to go someone else nearby.

177
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,899
Mikuru, get ready.

178
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,479
A-Am I going, too?

179
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:34,239
Of course. We can't do anything
without the lead.

180
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,789
B-But... in this outfit?

181
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,249
Yup, that's right.

182
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,119
C-Could I at least wear
a jacket over this?

183
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,989
No! It's because you think you're
embarrassed that you get all nervous.

184
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:49,789
At this rate, we'll never be able
to get a Golden Globe!

185
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:53,999
Weren't we trying to get "best of the
festival" for the school festival?

186
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,629
Oh, yeah, Yuki!

187
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,299
Take this!

188
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,409
I've changed your role, so now
you're an evil alien witch!

189
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,009
And she's already screwing
with the script!

190
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,269
Well, it is true that Nagato's powers
seem like magic.

191
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,449
Come on, Kyon,
get the camera ready!

192
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,879
Okay, let's get going!

193
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,289
All together!

194
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,859
It looks like she's serious.

195
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,129
What the?

196
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,599
Hey, Haruhi.

197
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:38,039
You don't intend to make these two get
on the train in these outfits, do you?

198
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,379
- Is there a problem with that?
- Of course there is!

199
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,509
Why? They might get arrested
if they were buck naked,

200
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:46,989
but they're
wearing clothes, right?

201
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,319
Oh, would the bunny girl outfit
have been better?

202
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,329
You should have
said so earlier.

203
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,299
I don't think that's something that
someone who went to the trouble

204
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,559
of getting a waitress outfit
should be saying!

205
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,929
Wait, didn't you say that her being a waitress
was part of the movie's concept?

206
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,669
What's most important
right now is adaptability.

207
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:07,069
That's how all living things on the
Earth have managed to evolve, right?

208
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,749
If you just idly stand by, you're
going to get left behind!

209
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,109
If the environment
was sentient,

210
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,409
then Haruhi would have been thrown
out of the atmosphere by now.

211
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,379
Oh, the train's here!

212
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,949
Come on, Mikuru!
Get going already!

213
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,689
We're here,
as promised!

214
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,759
Oh, good work.

215
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,919
Ah, is this the girl from the day before
yesterday? I didn't recognize her.

216
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,169
Okay, I'm counting
on you.

217
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,739
Roger that!

218
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:37,839
All right, everyone.

219
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,379
We're going to have a quick meeting,
so gather around.

220
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,709
We're going to be shooting
a commercial!

221
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,039
What?

222
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,879
Ohmori Electronics

223
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,459
T-This shop is...

224
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,259
The manager is a really good person.
And he's a nice guy.

225
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,959
Umm... They've been around since
current owner Eijirou's grandfather.

226
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:10,739
You can find anything from batteries
to refrigerators here.

227
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:12,979
Umm... well...

228
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,339
In any case, please come by
Ohmori Electronics!

229
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,009
Okay, cut!

230
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,479
Hmm, I just don't feel
the emotion...

231
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,989
I wonder why that is...

232
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,219
Mama, what's that?

233
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,349
Shh, you mustn't look.

234
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:30,559
I've got it!

235
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,889
For the love of God, please
don't "get" anything else!

236
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,189
It doesn't make sense for a waitress
to be at an electronics store.

237
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,359
That's "it"!?

238
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,059
Koizumi, hand me
the small bag over there!

239
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:42,029
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,269
"Let me have a camera, and I'll put a
commercial for your store in my movie."

241
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,669
"Sure thing."

242
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,539
That's probably the conversation Haruhi
had with the owner in five seconds.

243
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,349
Mikuru, come here
a second.

244
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,259
Oh my. It doesn't look like I'll
have any lines in this part.

245
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:06,089
Actually, I'm one of the actors in
my class's stage production, too.

246
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,859
I'm having quite a hard time
remembering all of the lines.

247
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,229
Oh really.

248
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,399
I'd prefer it if my role for this
was light on lines, but...

249
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,339
How about if you take
the lead role?

250
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:20,239
Haruhi's the one controlling
the casting.

251
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,139
Ask her if you want
to switch.

252
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,809
Do you really think that I could do
something as frightening as that?

253
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,809
These are Miss Suzumiya's
orders after all,

254
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,519
and I'd rather not imagine what would
await me if I disobeyed them.

255
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:39,919
I'd rather not, either. That's why
I'm sitting here as the cameraman.

256
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,599
And we're back!

257
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,099
It's Miss Asahina's first costume
from a while back.

258
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,539
A perfect bunny girl.

259
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:53,099
Oh yeah, that was over
half a year ago.

260
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,469
Now that I think about it,
quite a bit happened then.

261
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,539
Right now,
they're fond memories...

262
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,849
As if!

263
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,979
Okay, this is perfect!

264
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,919
A bunny girl really is the best fit
for introducing a product.

265
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,079
Okay, we're going to take it
from the top!

266
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,189
Kyon, get the
camera ready!

267
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,759
All right,
this is take two!

268
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,999
And so, the commercial for the
electronics store was finished.

269
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,899
There's one thing you need
to remember, though.

270
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,239
There was one other sponsor
that we visited last time.

271
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,709
Yamatsuchi Model Shop

272
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,049
All right.
Okay then, Mikuru.

273
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,209
Do it just like you did
at the other store!

274
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,719
There were no problems
that time!

275
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,609
Like hell there weren't.

276
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,049
Okay, action!

277
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:44,219
T-This model shop opened
for business last year

278
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:47,889
after Mr. Keiji Yamatsuchi, age 28,
left his corporate job.

279
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:52,629
It's like his hobbies took over
his actions, and he just did it.

280
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,169
And as many thought,
sales haven't met expectations...

281
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:06,239
The first-half earnings this year
are down 80% from last year...

282
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,139
So shop as much
as you can, everyone!

283
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,859
You want me
to hold it?

284
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,259
D-Don't shoot while pointing
at people!

285
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,059
Hold off by shooting things
like empty cans!

286
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,029
You want me
to shoot?

287
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,639
All right, cut!

288
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,169
Today's filming
was only so-so.

289
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,809
But tomorrow we're going to start
shooting the movie itself.

290
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:44,689
We've already added fifteen minutes
to the movie with the commercials.

291
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:46,789
How long is the actual movie
going to be?

292
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,419
Well, we'll just shoot as much as
we can and edit it down later.

293
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,859
These days, it's a snap
with a computer.

294
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,989
And who's going to be doing
the snapping?

295
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,859
I've got the feeling that "editor" was
one of the things listed under my jobs.

296
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,199
Tomorrow's Saturday,
and a day off from school,

297
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:03,139
so I want everyone
to show up!

298
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,179
Be at Kitaguchi Station
at nine o'clock!

299
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,769
Hey, Haruhi. Can't you do something
about Miss Asahina's outfit?

300
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:15,479
There has to be a more appropriate
outfit for someone who fights.

301
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,919
You know, like a plug suit
or a stealth suit or something.

302
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,649
Tsk tsk.

303
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,059
If she wore something like that,
there'd be no unpredictability.

304
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,749
The audience will be surprised
and go "whoa!"

305
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,199
Because it's a waitress
that's fighting.

306
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,059
Being able to grab the
audience is vital!

307
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:31,859
That's the concept,
you know!

308
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,199
I wonder if she understands the
meaning of the word "concept."

309
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:40,539
Well, never mind that, then.
Why is she here from the future?

310
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,279
Well, that is, you know.

311
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:46,539
Umm, the character doesn't have
to be from the future, right?

312
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,739
It's all right!

313
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,049
We'll figure that out
when the time comes!

314
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,549
And if we can't think of something,
then we'll just ignore it!

315
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,189
As long as it's amusing,
it's fine!

316
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,529
That's only if it's
amusing though, right?

317
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,329
It's not much good if only the
director finds it amusing!

318
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:08,699
Are you trying to get the Golden
Raspberry award for non-pros?

319
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,399
What are you talking about?
There's only one thing we're going for.

320
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,439
That's the "best of the festival"
for the school festival!

321
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,139
And if we can,
the Golden Globe, too!

322
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,709
All right, then. At least show me
the script. How's it coming along?

323
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,349
No problem!

324
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,359
It's all up here. The script and the
storyboards are all ready to go!

325
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,389
You don't have to think
about a thing.

326
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,729
Well, that's just great.

327
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,729
You don't need to think
about anything, either.

328
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,889
You just need to sit and
stare out the window.

329
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,559
As long as you had a pleasant look on your
face, you'd be as cute as Miss Asahina.

330
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,139
What?

331
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,399
Nothing.

332
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,999
Okay, everyone.
We're going to get fired up!

333
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,939
You need to be idealistic if you
want to capture any glory.

334
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,219
When you free yourself of your inhibitions,
the latent abilities

335
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,289
within you will awaken,
revealing unimaginable powers!

336
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,289
This isn't a counterattack like you'd
see in a battle manga, you know...

337
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,159
- It's a balloon!
- Oh, you're right.

338
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:08,629
- It's a balloon!
- Oh, you're right.
The next morning.

339
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:13,839
As of today, we've fallen
into a strange situation.

340
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,599
No, how can I
put this?

341
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,509
What did Haruhi say?
Something like,

342
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,209
Mommy, how far will the balloon go?
Huh? Huh?
What did Haruhi say?
Something like,

343
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:19,309
Mommy, how far will the balloon go?
Huh? Huh?

344
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,049
Mommy, how far will the balloon go?
Huh? Huh?
"When you free yourself of your
inhibitions, the latent abilities

345
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:22,879
Well, pretty far.
"When you free yourself of your
inhibitions, the latent abilities

346
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:22,979
Well, pretty far.

347
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,519
Well, pretty far.
Within you will awaken,
revealing unimaginable powers!"

348
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,419
Within you will awaken,
revealing unimaginable powers!"

349
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:27,419
Huh? Pretty far?

350
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,619
Huh? Pretty far?
But Haruhi, the one gaining
powers won't be you.

351
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,049
But Haruhi, the one gaining
powers won't be you.

352
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,549
And you won't
even know it.

353
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,059
You're late!

354
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:38,989
It's not even nine yet.

355
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,459
You're still last. As punishment,
you're buying us lunch.

356
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:44,859
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,509
Well, I'll cover the bus fare!
It's part of our necessary expenses!

358
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,269
Thanks.

359
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,239
Oh yeah!

360
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,079
I need to put this on...

361
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:03,549
Why are you wearing
your school uniform?

362
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,319
She told me to
wear it yesterday.

363
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:13,019
It's because I'm playing a high school
student who has psychic powers.

364
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,759
So you're just
playing yourself.

365
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,259
All right, this works!

366
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,399
Okay, the bus stop
is this way!

367
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:18,799
Super Director
Okay, the bus stop
is this way!

368
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,969
Super Director
Come on, Kyon,
hurry up!

369
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,699
Come on, Kyon,
hurry up!

370
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,169
After thirty minutes of
being shaken by the bus

371
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,399
and thirty minutes
of walking,

372
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,239
we ended up in a place
that would make you ask,

373
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,509
"Why did we come to a place
no one wants to come to?"

374
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:35,479
Man, it's hot...

375
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:36,979
Umm...

376
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,849
Would you like some of mine?
If you don't mind that it's half-drunk...

377
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,059
Half-drunk?
Oh, thank you.

378
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,789
Take care of that later!
You too, Mikuru!

379
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:53,089
There's no time to give our gofer
a drink break!

380
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,569
Come on, we're going to
start shooting. Get changed!

381
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,699
But...

382
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,769
It's fine! If you go far enough in,
you won't run into anyone!

383
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,509
The half-drunk...

384
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,749
- Don't peek.
- Right.

385
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,419
Ta-dah!
It's a color contact.

386
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,529
Having different colored eyes
is pretty important, you know!

387
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,019
One differently colored eye will
increase the sense of mystery!

388
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,059
It's symbolic!

389
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:26,629
And there's a secret
in this blue eye of hers!

390
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:30,399
Well, it'd make no sense for her to
just have a differently colored eye.

391
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:32,439
So? What's the secret?

392
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,079
It's still a secret!

393
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:38,709
Come on, Mikuru, how long are
you going to loaf about?

394
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:44,519
Hey! Mikuru!
Stop being so embarrassed!

395
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,319
You just need to get
into your character!

396
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:52,359
Okay, try running
one more time.

397
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,999
It looks like this is our opening
sequence, worthy of celebration.

398
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:01,829
I thought that she'd at least
write a script or something,

399
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,569
but Haruhi simply declared
that there wasn't one.

400
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,609
We'd be in big trouble if I wrote
it down and it got leaked.

401
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,649
That's the reason
she gave.

402
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,909
I wonder when this turned
into a Hong Kong flick.

403
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,879
Okay! Once more, like you
did the third time!

404
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,619
Okay, next up is the fight scene
between Mikuru and Yuki!

405
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,959
Mikuru, shoot at Yuki
with all you've got!

406
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,689
But didn't they say to not
point these at people?

407
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,629
It's all right. There's no
way you'll hit her, Mikuru!

408
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,939
And if it looks like she'd get hit,
Yuki will be able to dodge it.

409
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,899
It's all right.
Fire.

410
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,739
See? She said it's all right!
Shoot her up!

411
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:46,209
Oh yeah, don't fire them at the
same time, but one after the other!

412
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:48,719
That's one of the basics
of two-gun fighting!

413
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,159
Yeah. I guess
this works.

414
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:05,629
Hey, Haruhi. How is this a movie?
I have no idea what's going on.

415
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:10,229
That's fine! We'll just cut and paste it
together during editing.

416
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:13,339
And who's going to do that?
That cutting and pasting?

417
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:15,539
At least put in
some dialog.

418
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,909
It's fine! If we have to, we'll mute the
sound and record the dialog afterwards!

419
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,179
We have to put in sound effects
and background music, anyways!

420
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:26,219
You don't have to think
too hard about this!

421
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,719
Even if we wanted to,
the story is only in your head,

422
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,029
so there's nothing for us
to think about.

423
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,639
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

424
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,349
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

425
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:53,869
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

426
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,149
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

427
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,789
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

428
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,989
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

429
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,529
Tomare!
Stop!

430
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,299
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

431
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:14,069
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

432
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,209
Nazenara
That's because

433
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:20,439
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

434
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,209
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

435
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,649
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

436
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:30,489
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

437
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:34,389
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

438
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,089
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

439
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,189
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
