Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.45,0:03:18.84,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,But where it places in the whole magazine is also important.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.84,0:03:20.38,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not that simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.03,0:03:24.36,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,But in that case, if the endorsement percentage is high and the ranking is low or something...

Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.86,0:04:31.25,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,didn't put them in their three most interesting, it'd be easier to decide.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.25,0:04:34.46,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why I said the endorsement item isn't needed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.46,0:04:38.52,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,But then we couldn't compare them separately from the currently serialized works.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.52,0:04:40.85,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, in reality they don't get really get compared to each other anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.50,0:04:44.26,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,If we break it down to being between "KIYOSHI" and "TRAP",

Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.50,0:06:00.74,Main,,0000,0000,0000,,But since they're taking 5000 votes now, it wouldn't be odd for those results to change.
