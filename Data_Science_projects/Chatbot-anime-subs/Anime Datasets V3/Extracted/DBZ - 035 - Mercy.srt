00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,005
Which way?

2
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,667
The left. A little more to the left.

3
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:26,284
Ah, I see it!
That's the island!

4
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:29,276
That island is where Goku
and the others are fighting.

5
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:36,628
What about Gohan!? Gohan-<i>chan</i>
really is still alive, right!? Really!?

6
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,630
P- probably...

7
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,124
What do you mean, " probably" !?
"Probably" isn't good enough!

8
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:50,642
I told you we shouldn't
have brought her.

9
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,145
<i>Still, l'm worried about</i>
<i>the four</i>- <i>no, five of them.</i>

10
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:57,808
<i>l can barely sense any Ki</i>
<i>from any of them.</i>

11
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:14,489
H- his tail? That's right... In the past,
Goku's tail suddenly grew back, too...

12
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:32,280
If he were to transform,
that would be a problem!

13
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:42,615
What!?

14
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,597
I got him! I got him!

15
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,261
T- take that, you jackass!
Ha-ha-ha on you!

16
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,775
How'dya like that!? Ain't no way
yer a match for Yajirobe-<i>sama</i>! Nyaah!

17
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,289
W- why, you!

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,450
You filthy bastard!

19
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:08,469
S- s- sorry 'bout that! Did it hurt?
I was just jokin' around. Did I cut ya?

20
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:16,319
That's right! I got lotsa respect
for ya! Lemme be your friend-

21
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,770
Y- Yajirobe...

22
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:52,780
<i>Nobody</i> inflicts a wound on my body
and gets away with it!

23
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:04,302
There's no way you're
getting away with that!

24
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:06,293
Dammit!

25
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,632
<i>G</i>- <i>Gohan... Gohan!</i>

26
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,136
<i>Gohan!</i>

27
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,811
T- that's Father's voice...

28
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:27,251
<i>Gohan, hear my voice...</i>

29
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:33,264
<i>Look at the ball</i>
<i>of light in the sky...</i>

30
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:37,928
B- ball of light?
Ball of light?

31
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:01,292
O- oh, hell!

32
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,628
You think I'm going
to allow that!?

33
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,459
Die!!

34
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,624
Oh, no!

35
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:20,803
You brat! I'm not about
to let you grow huge!

36
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,920
I- if I don't kill him right now-!

37
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,923
<i>Gohan! lt's up to you!</i>

38
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:37,929
G- Gohan is becoming a Great Ape...
I- it's an all-or-nothing gamble...

39
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:42,600
T- that's right! His tail! In my panic,
I forgot the most important thing!

40
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,431
If I can just cut off his tail!

41
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,734
G- Gohan...

42
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:35,587
B- but when Goku turned Great Ape,
he lost virtually all of his rationality!

43
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,578
What about Gohan?

44
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:48,600
Gohan is the same!
T- that makes sense.

45
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,603
It's not so much that Goku
and Gohan lose their rationality,

46
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:55,266
as it is that when they become Great Apes,
they revert to being ferocious Saiyans!

47
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:08,616
Hey! Stay back!

48
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,287
Gohan!

49
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,622
<i>Gohan!</i>

50
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,465
<i>G</i>- <i>Gohan!</i>

51
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,630
W- what happened to him?

52
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,582
G- Gohan...

53
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,250
The Saiyan!

54
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,650
Get the Saiyan!

55
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,814
You idiot!
Don't provoke him!

56
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,501
W- why, you!

57
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,005
Gohan!

58
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:15,887
T- the look in his eye is different.

59
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,856
Gohan! Get the Saiyan!

60
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:29,233
Great! There's still a little bit
of Gohan's mind left in there. S- sure...

61
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,963
He's half earthling!

62
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:44,649
T- the moon I created
won't go out for another hour...

63
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,810
I'll just have to cut off his tail!

64
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:11,943
What a freak. And after he's
taken all that damage, too.

65
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:13,843
Is this guy immortal?

66
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,271
D- damn! My power!

67
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:28,778
Dammit!

68
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,629
I- I can't move!

69
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:59,306
W- what happened?

70
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,324
D- did he get him?

71
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:23,941
Is he <i>still</i> alive?

72
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,932
What a monster!

73
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:03,981
T- the only things left in the city
appear to be these two strange spheres.

74
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:06,651
Does that mean that these
are the Saiyans' spaceships?

75
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:07,640
What's that?

76
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:15,491
I- it's flying!

77
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,942
W- what's that?

78
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,446
I- it's here...

79
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:12,639
T- to think that I would
have to withdraw...

80
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,760
D- damn...

81
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,264
Me, Vegeta-<i>sama</i>, known as the
mightiest warrior in the universe...

82
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,600
How disgraceful...

83
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,095
T- that's his spaceship...
Y- you're not about to get away...

84
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,114
Kuririn! Use my katana!

85
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:03,961
W- we've come this far...
I'm going to finish him off...

86
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:26,920
Hold it!

87
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:37,601
T- this is for everyone
that you killed...

88
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,603
Say your prayers!

89
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:42,766
Dammit! M- my body won't respond!

90
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,614
You did well to come this far.

91
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:55,619
I wasn't sure how this would turn out.
It's wrong for me to play favorites,

92
00:14:55,619 --> 00:15:01,625
but that Saiyan is a villain that has
plunged the whole universe into terror.

93
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,296
I can't help it.

94
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:10,468
Although, this will not completely
weed out the root of evil.

95
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,130
<i>No, not the root of evil...</i>

96
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,972
Die!!

97
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,308
<i>Wait!</i>

98
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,586
G- Goku?

99
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:35,926
Goku, was that you who just
spoke into my mind?

100
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:40,598
<i>Yeah, it was... I can't talk</i>
<i>very loud, and all...</i>

101
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:47,271
<i>K</i>- <i>Kuririn, forgive me,</i>
<i>but let him get away...</i>

102
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:50,608
Let him <i>what</i>?
A- are you crazy?

103
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:56,113
<i>P</i>- <i>please... T</i>- <i>this is the only thing</i>
<i>l'll ever ask for myself...</i>

104
00:15:56,113 --> 00:16:00,117
But Goku, this is the guy
that killed our friends,

105
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:03,621
and tried to kill everyone
else in the world!

106
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:08,959
If we let him go now, he's certain
to recover his strength, and come back here!

107
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,564
<i>Y</i>- <i>you're probably right...</i>

108
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:19,236
If you're thinking that maybe he'll have
a change of heart, the way Piccolo did,

109
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:24,241
then you're greatly mistaken!
He's not that kind of guy!

110
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:30,915
<i>l know that... and I know that Vegeta</i>
<i>there has incredible strength...</i>

111
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:34,919
<i>S</i>- <i>still... I ain't able</i>
<i>to say this too well...</i>

112
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:42,259
<i>but when I saw him nearly</i>
<i>dead there, I thought to myself...</i>

113
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,596
" <i>What a waste.</i>"

114
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:47,932
What a waste?

115
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:56,607
<i>After training at Kaio-sama's place,</i>
<i>l thought I had reached my pinnacle...</i>

116
00:16:56,607 --> 00:17:03,280
<i>But that Vegeta guy there</i>
<i>has done far better than I have...</i>

117
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,285
<i>lt surprised me... To be honest,</i>
<i>l was overwhelmed...</i>

118
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:15,226
<i>But somewhere within my heart,</i>
<i>l was happy, and excited...</i>

119
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,562
<i>That must be because</i>
<i>l'm a Saiyan too...</i>

120
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:21,963
<i>Whenever I see an amazing guy</i>
<i>like that, my heart leaps...</i>

121
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:34,578
<i>l want to train even more,</i>
<i>and fight him again...</i>

122
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:41,585
This is the guy who killed
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu!

123
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:48,926
<i>l know it's not the right thing to do...</i>
<i>but please... grant me my selfish request...</i>

124
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:54,831
<i>Let me have...</i>
<i>another chance to fight him!</i>

125
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:24,895
All right. You've got the right
to ask for something for yourself.

126
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,565
It's thanks to you that we even
have the earth at all now, Goku.

127
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,901
But remember, Goku...

128
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,905
Next time, you take him down
with devastating power!

129
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,465
Yeah, I sure will...

130
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:55,259
R- remember this well, you trash...
There aren't going to be any more miracles...

131
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,262
Next time we meet,
you're all dead!

132
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,163
Be sure to enjoy yourselves
to the fullest until then...

133
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,295
<i>For now, the danger of the</i>
<i>earth's extinction has passed.</i>

134
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:39,134
<i>Or has it? And what is this</i>
"<i>root of evil</i>" <i>that Kaio spoke of?</i>

135
