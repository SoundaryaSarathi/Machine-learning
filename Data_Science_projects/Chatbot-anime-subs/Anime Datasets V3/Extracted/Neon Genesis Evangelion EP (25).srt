<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>

<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700

Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900

<i>Hanega arukoto</i>

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>

18

<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,170
THE REASON OF EXISTENCE

23
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,800
WHY WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE HERE

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,550
THE CASE OF SHINJI IKARI

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,470
THE BOY WISHED FOR HIS DEATH

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,980
THE OTHER ONE FULFILLED THIS WISH

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,560
AND THE FINAL ANGEL PERISHED

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,860
BUT SHINJI IKARI WAS DOUBTING

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,360
WHY DID I KILL?

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,990
WHY DID I KILL?

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,040
WHY DID I KILL?

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,000
WHY DID I KILL?

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,080
WHY DID I KILL?

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,790
There was no other choice!

35
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,090
WHY DID I KILL?

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,130
Because he was an Angel!
Kaworu was an Angel!

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,260
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS HUMAN ASWELL?

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,470
He was still an Angel! He was
still one of the enemy!

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,640
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS HUMAN ASWELL?

40
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,600
He wasn't! He wasn't! He was not!

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,880
Even though he was
as human as me?

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,410
No! He was an Angel!

43
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,050
Is that why you killed him?

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,420
Yes! Otherwise we would
have all died!

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,150
We would have all been destroyed!

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,360
So, that's why you killed him?

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,990
I didn't want to kill him!
I didn't have a choice!

48
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,950
THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM.

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,490
Help me...

50
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,450
THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Help me...

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,580
THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM.

53
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,620
Help me!

54
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,120
THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,710
Somebody, please, help me!

56
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,790
THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM.

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,030
I'm begging you!
Somebody, please, help me!

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,540
You know, it was Kaworu who
should have survived.

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,440
He was much better than I am.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,590
He was the one who should
have survived.

61
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,390
No, the one who survives is the one
who has the will to survive.

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,760
He wished for death.

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,660
He neglected his will to survive
and chose a false hope.

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,930
You weren't wrong, Shinji.

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,120
Are you sure?

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,790
FEAR

67
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,080
Are you sure it was right?

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,540
OBSESSION

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,710
I don't understand.
What can I do?

70
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,140
What am I supposed to do?!

71
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,170
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,290
What was that?

73
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,130
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,250
I fear myself.

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,080
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,460
I fear being hated.

77
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,210
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,000
But by whom?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,550
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?

80
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,300
Who is it?

81
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,760
WHO DO YOU FEAR?

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
It's my

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,820
father!

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,690
My father abandoned me.
He hates me.

85
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,230
If others hate me, what will I do?
What will I do?

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,330
Where am I?

87
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,880
Where am I supposed to go?

88
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,870
I can't see anything. I don't
understand what I feel.

89
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,380
Misato?

90
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,380
Misato?!

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,790
Hey, where are you, Misato?

92
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,060
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

93
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,170
Misato? Asuka? Ayanami?

94
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,260
Toji? Kensuke? Ritsuko? Kaji?

95
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,910
Father?

96
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,840
Mother?

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,900
Somebody, please! Please tell
me what I have to do now!

98
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,380
Evangelion Unit 01...

99
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,710
I still have to pilot it? Even after
it made me kill him?

100
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,430
My father and the others tell me I
have to pilot it no matter what.

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,520
Why do I have to keep fighting
after all that's happened?!

102
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,500
Mother!

103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,660
Say something! Answer me!

104
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,880
WHY DO YOU PILOT EVA?

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,130
Because everyone tells me to.

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,380
THAT'S WHY YOU PILOT EVA?

107
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,110
What do you mean?

108
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,670
It's for the sake of Mankind!
Isn't that good enough?

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
YOU PILOT EVA FOR OTHERS?

110
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,620
That's right! Is there something
wrong with that?!

111
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,680
I'm doing the right thing!

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,380
When I do it the others appreciate
me! The others like me then!

113
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,660
You're lying!

114
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,230
Are you stupid?!

115
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,720
You know damn well that you
do this for yourself!

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,760
You're just making excuses,
the way you always do!

117
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,700
I do?

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,070
Pretending that you're sacrificing
yourself for the sake of others

119
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,040
Pretending that you're sacrificing
yourself for the sake of others

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,470
is just another cop out, isn't it?

121
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,040
It makes you feel so superior
to play the martyr!

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,910
I'm not sure that's true.

123
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,710
You're feeling lonely and
isolated, nothing more.

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,250
Am I?

125
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,320
Of course you are!
You live on sympathy!

126
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
You gain it through your symbiosis
with your Eva, Shinji!

127
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,750
It could be true.

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,090
You love having others
depend on you!

129
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,660
It really satisfies your
twisted little mind!

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,180
That could be.

131
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,200
All you're doing is sitting
there and waiting

132
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,430
for someone else to bring
you happiness!

133
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,130
But it's a false happiness!

134
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,790
But isn't that what you've
been doing?

135
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,320
THE SECOND CHARACTER:

136
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,660
THE CASE OF ASUKA SORYU LANGLEY

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,810
I don't want to be in this Eva again.

138
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,300
They're forcing me to pilot this.

139
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,440
But this piece of junk won't work!

140
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,160
But it's only junk because of what
I've become. I'm the garbage now.

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm worthless. Nobody needs me.

142
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,760
Nobody needs a pilot who can't
even control her own Eva.

143
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,370
You seek your own value in the
perception of others.

144
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,230
Shut up!

145
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,070
FEAR OF SEPERATION

146
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,700
Do you fear being alone?

147
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,320
FEAR OF SEPERATION

148
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,370
Are you afraid that you will lose
your identity if others leave you?

149
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,820
FEAR OF SEPERATION

150
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,240
You pilot the Eva so that you'll
be praised by others.

151
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,700
DEPENDENCY

152
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,620
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

153
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,330
DEPENDENCY

154
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,990
Shut up! Just shut up!

155
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,750
How can a wind-up doll like
you dare to tell me that?!

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THE THIRD CHARACTER:

157
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,590
THE CASE OF REI ANAMI

158
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,830
Who am I?

159
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,460
You are Rei Ayanami.

160
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,130
But who are you?

161
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,550
REI AYANAMI

162
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,240
Are you Rei Ayanami as well?

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,810
Correct, I am that which is
recognized as Rei Ayanami.

164
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,180
We are all things that are
known as Rei Ayanami.

165
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,810
How could all of these be me?

166
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,080
It is simply because the others call
us Rei Ayanami, that is all.

167
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,350
You possess a false soul and a fake
body? Do you know why?

168
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,550
I am neither false nor fake.
I am simply me.

169
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,890
No, you are an empty shell
with a false soul,

170
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,350
created by a man named
Gendo Ikari.

171
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,200
You are just an object that is
pretending to be a human.

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,900
See, look deep within yourself.

173
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,270
Do you perceive the
almost intangible,

174
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,310
invisible presence that lurks
inside your darkest dreams?

175
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,110
It is there that your
true identity lies.

176
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,010
No, I am me.

177
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,080
I became myself through the
instrumentality of the links

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,570
and my relationships with others.

179
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,720
I am formed by interaction
with others.

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,880
They create me as I create them.

181
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,060
These relationships and interactions

182
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,240
serve to shape the patterns
of my heart and mind.

183
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,410
IS THAT ATTACHMENT TO PEOPLE?

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,630
Yes, that is the name for what
I share with those

185
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,030
who have created the being
known as Rei Ayanami.

186
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,500
That is what will continue
to shape me.

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
THAT MEANS ATTACHMENT TO PEOPLE

188
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,140
However, there is someone
else who is your true self.

189
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,150
You don't know her, but she exists.

190
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,750
You deny that fact

191
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,760
and attempt to suppress that
facet of your reality.

192
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,810
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF THAT

193
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,020
Because she might not
have a human form.

194
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,850
Because then your present
self might cease to be.

195
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,560
I AM AFRAID

196
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,460
This is what you fear, that you
will become nothing.

197
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,530
You are frightened that you will
disappear from the minds of others

198
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,970
if another exists.

199
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,740
I'm afraid? Why is that?

200
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,450
Because then your current self
will have never existed.

201
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,500
AREN'T YOU AFRAID?

202
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,430
Because you will cease to be.

203
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,500
AREN'T YOU AFRAID?

204
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,810
No, I'm happy.

205
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,690
Because I want to die.
I want despair.

206
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,360
I want to return to nothing.

207
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,860
But I can't.

208
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,690
He won't let me return
to nothingness yet.

209
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,680
He won't let me return yet.

210
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,950
I still exist because he needs me.

211
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,200
But when everything is over,

212
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,790
when I am of no use anymore,

213
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,000
he will abandon me.

214
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,400
I've prayed for the day he
would abandon me.

215
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,840
But now, I fear it.

216
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:49,180
Well, let's go. This is the day for
which you were created, Rei.

217
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,420
YES.

218
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,840
AND SO THE HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT BEGINS

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,970
BACK TO SHINJI IKARI

220
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,160
What is this feeling?

221
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,310
I think I've experienced
this sensation before.

222
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,000
It's as though my physical
form were disappearing.

223
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,870
It feels nice.

224
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,420
As though my being is
spreading itself out

225
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,850
to cover the entirety of existence.

226
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,780
BEGIN OF THE PROJECT

227
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,040
WHAT THE HUMANS LOST:

228
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
LOSS OF SOULS

229
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,580
FILLING THE VOID OF THE SOULS

230
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,580
BEGINNING OPTIMIZATION OF SOULS

231
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,830
EVERYTHING RETURNS TO NOTHINGNESS

232
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
THE HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT COMMENCES

233
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,240
Incorrect. It is not a return
to nothingness.

234
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,600
It is merely a return to the
state of beginning.

235
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,740
It is no less than a return to the
primal womb that we lost long ago.

236
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,480
All individual souls and minds
will become one,

237
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,270
thereby attaining a state
of eternal peace.

238
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,250
The final goal is nothing
more than that.

239
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,880
And that's Instrumentality?

240
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,990
There's an emptiness in our souls,
a fundamental incompleteness

241
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,570
that has haunted all beings
since the very first thought.

242
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,360
THIS IS STARVING SOULS AND INSTILLS FEARS

243
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,730
On a primal level, Man knows of the
darkness at the core of his mind.

244
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,100
We have sought to escape this
void and the fear it causes.

245
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,530
All Man's accomplishments stem
from the hope of filling it.

246
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,740
The darkness will never vanish as
long as Mankind is merely human.

247
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,640
And so you'll just crush everyone's
minds together to fill the gaps?!

248
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,140
How dare you presume to make the
entirety of human existence

249
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,680
into an experiment to
prove your theory?!

250
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,250
And to use deception in order
to accomplish it?!

251
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,840
And yet, that is exactly as
you wished it to be!

252
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,510
Where am I?

253
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,220
THE CASE OF MISATO KATSURAGI (PART I)

254
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,880
This is the me that exists
in your mind, Misato.

255
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,010
And yet, at the same time

256
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,510
this is also the me which exists
in your mind, isn't it, Shinji?

257
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,450
In order to establish my identity,

258
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,750
I have to communicate with
the minds of many people.

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
I have to examine that
which is at my core.

260
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,890
I have to stare at Misato who
resides on the inside of my mind.

261
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,580
What is it that you wish for, Misato?

262
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,710
DO YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD CHILD?

263
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,210
I have to be a good child.

264
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,130
WHY?

265
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,830
Because I have no papa.

266
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,540
I have to be good and not
bother my momma.

267
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,210
But I don't want to become
like my momma.

268
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,640
When my papa is not here,
she always cries.

269
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,040
I can't cry. I can't depend
on anyone else.

270
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,420
So, I have to be good.

271
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,280
That way, maybe my papa
won't hate me.

272
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,480
But I hated my father, and I
hated being a good child.

273
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,860
I hate it.

274
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,590
I'm tired of it.

275
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm tired of keeping myself clean.

276
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm tired of myself pretending
to be pure and noble.

277
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,450
I'm so tired of it all.

278
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,670
I want to disgrace myself.

279
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,340
I want to see my life and my
reputation ruined.

280
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,770
Is that why you slept with him?
With Kaji?

281
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,180
No! I slept with him because
I loved him.

282
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,110
Did you really love him?

283
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,970
Yes, I did! He accepted
me for myself!

284
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,720
REALLY?

285
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,710
He was kind!

286
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,400
No! Don't show this to Shinji!

287
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,610
Why are you still embarrassed
after all that's happened?

288
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,510
Because I'm ashamed of it!

289
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,140
Why does this embarrass you?

290
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,140
You aren't ashamed.

291
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,980
On the contrary, it pleased you to
reveal yourself to one you love.

292
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,610
No, don't do this!

293
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,150
You're happy to show this
to Shinji, aren't you?

294
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,420
It's a lie! No, no, I'm not!

295
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,960
Are you sure? Or perhaps it's your
father you'd like to show this to?

296
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,360
No!

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,970
Wasn't it really peace of mind that
you were seeking in Kaji's bed?

298
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,030
No!

299
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,140
You wanted peace of mind and
warmth from Kaji, then?

300
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,540
No!

301
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,040
You wanted to find your father in
Kaji's embrace, didn't you?

302
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,530
It's not true!

303
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,950
It is true.

304
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,350
In Kaji, I had found my
father reborn.

305
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,510
And so, I fled from him.

306
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,220
I was so afraid. He was so
much like my father.

307
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,460
But at the same time, I was also
very happy. I was never happier.

308
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,360
That was such a wonderful time.

309
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,500
That's why I hated it.
That's why I left.

310
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,040
So, no reason was required
to begin our love,

311
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,140
but you needed a reason
for ending it?

312
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,810
You are so kind, Kaji.

313
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,380
You are so kind. I beg you...

314
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,610
Disgrace me.

315
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,160
Just because you hate
yourself is no reason

316
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,130
to injure yourself further.

317
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,060
Punishing yourself
is simply a cheat

318
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,830
to make you feel better
for a little while.

319
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,640
Don't do this to yourself.

320
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,870
And now, you'll tell me to
take care of myself?

321
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,310
Men always do that.

322
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,610
They escape to their jobs, their own
world, and leave me behind.

323
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,440
They always leave me behind.

324
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,770
Just like my father did.

325
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,950
They always escape from
the harsh realities.

326
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,020
Harsh realities? I am
his harsh reality.

327
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,690
Of course, I'm a problem, aren't I?

328
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,500
Stop that, Misato!

329
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,800
I despise myself! I hate myself!

330
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,100
You're vulgar and impure.

331
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
You're pathetic.

332
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,600
You're disgusting!
You're a dirty whore!

333
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,370
You're disgusting!
You're a dirty whore!

334
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,710
I've never seen anyone in such
a disgusting relationship!

335
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,010
Congratulations on your promotion,
Major Katsuragi!

336
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,210
The me who is recognized

337
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,820
is the me who's performing a role
in order to be appreciated,

338
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,510
but she's not the real me.

339
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,290
Your true self is always
crying, isn't she?

340
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,780
Yes, but I'm happy.

341
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,650
AM I HAPPY?

342
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,900
I am happy.

343
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,820
AM I HAPPY?

344
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,740
It's true, I am happy!

345
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,660
AM I HAPPY?

346
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,490
I'm not! This isn't the
happiness I want!

347
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,410
WHAT IS HAPPINESS?

348
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,500
This isn't me, it's not my true self!

349
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,840
I just don't want to face
the harsh reality!

350
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,000
But we must. We can't
live otherwise.

351
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,650
You'd be alone and afraid...

352
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,080
...unstable...

353
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,220
...if nobody was sleeping
next to you.

354
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,390
Are you afraid of sleeping alone?

355
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,290
Or does sleeping by yourself remind
you of how empty your life is?

356
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,850
She can't stand not having
other souls around her.

357
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,260
So, you'll sleep with anyone,
won't you?

358
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,630
No!

359
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,430
Yes, you just want to be infatuated
with primal ecstasy.

360
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,700
You want to fill the hole in your
heart with temporary escape.

361
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,740
You take advantage of men to
soothe the pain in your soul.

362
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,040
No! No! No!

363
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,290
JUST WHAT DOES SHE WISH FOR?

364
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,200
Where am I?

365
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,950
This is the me which exists in
your mind, Asuka.

366
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,020
And yet, at the same time

367
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,920
this is also the me which exists
in your mind, isn't it, Shinji?

368
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,880
THE CASE OF SORYU ASUKA LANGLEY (PART I)

369
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,420
What do you want, Asuka?

370
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,660
I want to live by myself!

371
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,770
I don't want my papa and my
momma. I'll live by myself!

372
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,460
And then I won't cry anymore!

373
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,940
But I'm still crying.

374
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,430
Why am I still crying?

375
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,610
I'm sorry. I just don't like her.

376
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,650
What happened to you,
the capable doctor?

377
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,680
I told you, I'm a human being
before I'm a doctor.

378
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,760
But how can a trained
professional like you...

379
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,850
She acts too much like an adult and
she rejects me absolutely.

380
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,250
Sometimes she even scares me.

381
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,130
Have you had such a
feeling with her?

382
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,170
No, and, in any case, you are
now Asuka's mother.

383
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,110
That may be, but I'm your
wife before that.

384
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,340
Both duties are concurrent.

385
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,610
In a social perspective, yes.

386
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,080
In a social perspective, yes.

387
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,010
But you can't quit being her father.

388
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,450
I can quit being her mother anytime.

389
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,550
Well, you could say so.

390
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,360
No, Momma! Don't quit being my
momma! I'll be a good kid!

391
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,600
Don't stop being my momma!

392
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Don't ignore me!

393
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,530
No, momma! Don't kill me!

394
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,670
Your papa hates your momma.

395
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,470
He doesn't need me anymore.

396
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,910
No, he didn't love me
to begin with.

397
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,640
He didn't need me at all.

398
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,650
So, let's die together because
Papa doesn't need us.

399
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,020
Am I a waste? Am I not
worth anything?

400
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,860
Die with me!

401
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,430
No, I am not your doll!

402
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll think for myself and
live by myself!

403
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,360
Then, my momma was hanging
from the ceiling.

404
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,200
She looked so happy.

405
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,470
But I hated how she looked.

406
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,740
I don't want to die. I don't
want to disappear.

407
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,680
I hate boys! I hate my papa
and my momma!

408
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,150
I hate everyone!

409
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,060
Nobody cares about me.

410
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,940
Nobody stays with me!

411
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,350
WHAT DOES SHE WISH FOR?

412
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,060
So, I don't want to depend
on anybody!

413
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,200
But I hate it at the same time.
It's a pain!

414
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,400
I don't want to be alone!

415
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,370
I don't want to be alone!

416
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,700
I don't want to be alone!

417
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,080
Don't leave me.

418
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,480
Don't abandon me.

419
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't kill me.

420
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,340
What is this?

421
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,590
This is the Instrumentality which
your father is beginning.

422
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,490
This is it?

423
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,090
This is part of it.

424
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,260
This is part of it.

425
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,700
You can't tell what the truth is.

426
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,260
You can barely tell if what
you're feeling is real.

427
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,670
The truth is within you.

428
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,940
And the facts that remain
in your memory

429
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,840
are what will become your truth.

430
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,310
Truth can be changed
from time to time.

431
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,350
This is all real. This is the
result of everything?

432
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,320
This is real, but only one of
the many realities.

433
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,880
This is the conclusion you wanted.

434
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,090
Wanted? Me?

435
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,260
Yes, total destruction.

436
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,360
You wished for a world in which
nobody would be saved.

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,520
No! I didn't wish for this!
The others didn't save me.

438
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,900
Nobody can save you.

439
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,670
This is what you wished for.

440
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,970
Destruction, death and a
return to nothingness.

441
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,210
You wished for these.

442
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,080
This is that reality.

443
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,880
What is reality?

444
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
This is your world.

445
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,910
A world for yourself that exists
without time, space or others.

446
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,320
A world in which every facet
was determined by you.

447
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
This is the world where
you just wait

448
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,750
for others to give you something.

449
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,830
THAT IS THE REALITY

450
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,790
This is your world no matter what.

451
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,280
This is the world that is!
Nothing can change that!

452
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,590
No, you made the decision.

453
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,010
This is the world where your
mind decides what will be.

454
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,090
THAT IS THE REALITY

455
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,160
Whether it is the will to survive,

456
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,260
or a wish for death,
it is all up to you.

457
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,270
Are you saying that this darkness,
this insane world,

458
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,400
are what I really wished to create?!

459
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,540
Yes.

460
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,900
You wished for a closed world that
was comfortable for you.

461
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,430
You wished for a closed world that
was comfortable for you.

462
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,750
In order to protect your weakness.

463
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,410
To protect your few pleasures.

464
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,650
This is merely a result of your wish.

465
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,890
In your closed world, in a world
where only you are allowed to be,

466
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,650
others cannot live with you.

467
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,820
But still you wished to close the
world that surrounds you.

468
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,930
Your wish ejected things
you disliked,

469
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,830
and created an isolated
and lonely world.

470
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,770
This is the world your wishes
have created,

471
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,070
a private haven in the recesses
of your mind.

472
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,970
This is how it ends. It is one of
many possible endings.

473
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,440
This is an ending you brought upon
yourself. You chose this fate.

474
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,940
AND THE HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT CONTINUES...

475
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,650
TO BE CONTINUED

476
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,880
Preview

477
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,700
An end always comes
after a beginning.

478
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,350
Will our hopes result in
ultimate destruction?

479
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,000
Is our hope death itself?

480
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,880
It's the final episode:

481
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,160
"The Beast that Shouted "I" at
the Heart of the World."
