1
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:32,488
Well done, everyone.
I have been expecting you.

2
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:40,725
Thank you very much, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.
Please tell us what our mission is this time.

3
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:47,372
The traitor Vegeta has taken the Dragon
Balls that I had gathered, and fled.

4
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,707
Vegeta...

5
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,709
Hey, that's that Saiyan, right?

6
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:56,113
I hear he's quite the arrogant bastard, for
someone who doesn't have that much power.

7
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:01,052
Vegeta has betrayed Freeza-<i>sama</i>...

8
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:06,490
However, for whatever reason, his battle
power is starting to rise higher and higher.

9
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:18,069
Although, he should still
be no match for you.

10
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:22,407
Please rough him up so as not to
kill him, and bring him back here.

11
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:26,745
I would like to force him to tell me
where he has hidden the Dragon Balls.

12
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:32,751
That will be a simple task.
Our Scouters are already tracking Vegeta.

13
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:37,415
He appears to be traveling at
high speed not too far from here.

14
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,760
What is the matter?

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,696
Who might these other two
who are with him be?

16
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:48,767
They appear to have
a fairly high battle power.

17
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:54,039
Two of them? Ah, those must be
the two children who interfered earlier.

18
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:57,042
So they <i>have</i> teamed up
with each other, have they?

19
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,339
What are we to do with them?

20
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,385
You are to kill them.

21
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,717
--Lucky!
--Hooray! Hooray!

22
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:16,888
Understood. Let us go
thoroughly enjoy ourselves.

23
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,592
At the heart of it all,

24
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:52,529
you are no more than just a Saiyan
monkey, kneeling under our rule.

25
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,670
Don't go thinking you're on
an equal level with us,

26
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,662
just because Freeza-<i>sama</i>
has taken a liking to you!

27
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,148
As perfect as Freeza-<i>sama</i>
might be in everything else,

28
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,385
there's still one thing
that I can't comprehend.

29
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,054
And that's how someone
as useless as you are

30
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:19,391
has been admitted into
the Ginyu Special Corps.

31
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,227
What!? Try saying that again!

32
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:26,664
Don't breathe next to me.
It stinks so bad, I can't stand it.

33
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,230
I'll show you whether
or not I'm useless!

34
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:39,411
This is no time
to be playing around...

35
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:40,571
...Vegeta-<i>san</i>.

36
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,258
A very nice planet has been found.
It should sell at a high price.

37
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:56,027
Let us go see it- just the two of us.

38
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,153
As you wish.

39
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,029
Looks like you got away with your life.
You're a lucky one, at least.

40
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,051
That miserable Vegeta...

41
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,055
Oh my, what's the matter, Ghurd?
Do you have to go potty?

42
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,716
No, it's nothing.

43
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,398
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, the Scouters
you ordered are in this case.

44
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,626
Well done.

45
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,738
Well then, we will be off.

46
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,677
Special Corps!

47
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:07,195
Ginyu! Fight!

48
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,378
<i>They've started moving.</i>

49
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,893
T- they're fast! Hurry!
They're going to overtake us!

50
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:43,067
<i>These strong guys are coming</i>
<i>at us, one after the next...</i>

51
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:46,833
<i>There's nothing we can do! Father!</i>

52
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:59,678
<i>20 minutes to arrival at Planet Namek.</i>
<i>20 minutes to arrival at Planet Namek.</i>

53
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,890
All right...

54
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,731
Oh yeah...

55
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:11,347
Kaio-<i>sama</i> didn't have
to send me so many of them.

56
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:20,031
Someone even more
incredible than Vegeta, huh?

57
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,522
Stay alive, everyone.

58
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:29,433
Ten more minutes...

59
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:39,073
It's funny. I don't feel any fear.
What am I so relaxed for?

60
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:51,996
There's going to be someone
unbelievable out there...

61
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,665
...and yet, nothing.

62
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:58,398
Maybe training in all that outrageous
gravity has made me crazy.

63
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,749
Over there!

64
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:21,750
We've got them all!

65
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:23,922
Come on!

66
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,360
What's the matter!?
Get over here, now!

67
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,038
Why, you!

68
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,275
Gohan, no matter how I think
this through, it's not right.

69
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:41,379
How can we let this guy
have eternal life?

70
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,047
Don't give me that now!

71
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:44,878
Hurry up and turn over your Ball!

72
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:49,579
We don't have time to dawdle!

73
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:01,399
Yo, Veggie-<i>chan</i>.

74
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,991
It's been a long time, huh?

75
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,920
Dammit! And I was so close!

76
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:34,091
They're fast! They were so fast,
I didn't even know they were approaching!

77
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:44,101
By any chance, is that one
of those Dragon Ball things?

78
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,307
There are five of them lying over here.

79
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,409
This is all because you were so slow!

80
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,808
H- how can you say that?

81
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,352
Freeza-<i>sama</i> will be overjoyed by this.

82
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,756
You have to get all seven
Dragon Balls together, right?

83
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,092
There are five of them behind us,
and you've got two of them.

84
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,083
That's all of them, isn't it?

85
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:43,431
<i>W</i>- <i>what Vegeta said was true.</i>
<i>l'm no match for them!</i>

86
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,906
<i>And that guy is exceptionally</i>
<i>amazing, even among these guys.</i>

87
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:58,379
Y- you think we're going
to just hand them over to you!?

88
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:11,395
You seem to have it all wrong.

89
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,599
Without Freeza-<i>sama</i>'s power,
you can't do anything!

90
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,068
Watch what you're saying!

91
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,402
What!?

92
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,404
Come on! Come on!

93
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:25,409
<i>That guy... that guy alone</i>
<i>is really not all that tough.</i>

94
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:28,003
<i>W</i>- <i>why is that guy</i>
<i>mixed in with them?</i>

95
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:37,748
Stay back! You smell so bad,
I can't take it.

96
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,081
--Die!!
--Whoa!

97
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,097
Don't go acting on your own, Ghurd.

98
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:49,760
It's not like we've decided
that he's your prey yet.

99
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,642
Why don't you hand that over
right now, Vegeta?

100
00:11:57,642 --> 00:11:59,210
Although, even if you do
hand it over quietly,

101
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,701
we have no intention of turning
a blind eye to you.

102
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:07,652
You guys may be able to search
for people with your Scouters,

103
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:09,711
but I doubt you can search for these.

104
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,049
What of it?

105
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,551
This is what!

106
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,266
I'm back.

107
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:21,722
That's too bad. It looked like
you were trying to throw it far away.

108
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,696
Unfortunately for you, Butta's speed
is the fastest in the universe.

109
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,897
T- that's impossible!

110
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:38,841
Now then, the other one...

111
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,707
Destroy it!

112
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,111
Damn it all!

113
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,586
The Dragon Ball...

114
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,195
H- how?

115
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,636
So the rumors were true, were they?

116
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,036
What do you mean, rumors?

117
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,308
They say that Ghurd is able
to control and stop time,

118
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,242
momentary though it may be.

119
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:19,383
T- that can't be true...

120
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,544
It's true, all right.

121
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,925
Well then, that makes all of them.

122
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:32,496
Now, for your turn. We're going to
give you plenty of tender loving care.

123
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,065
And when he says tender loving care,

124
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:37,802
he doesn't mean patting your head,
and tossing you up in the air.

125
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:40,237
He means we're going to hurt you.

126
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,171
You don't have to explain that!

127
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,576
Vegeta, is fighting them
the only thing we can do?

128
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,711
You must have realized
running away would be futile.

129
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,612
Having you guys around
is better than nothing.

130
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,187
Even knowing the extent of your power

131
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,179
you showed me on Earth will be useless,
I'll still be counting on it.

132
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,359
I'll take Vegeta.

133
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,528
You guys decide who
gets the other two

134
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,031
unknown pipsqueaks
by rock-paper-scissors.

135
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,200
--Why do you always do this?
--That's not fair!

136
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,069
--You can't do that, Commander Ginyu!
--Yeah!

137
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,339
You took the tastiest piece last time,
too, didn't you!?

138
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:17,441
You can't do that!

139
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:21,207
Let me have him!
I owe him one!

140
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:23,747
I guess I've got no choice.

141
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:28,385
All right then, I'll take
the Dragon Balls to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

142
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,888
You guys take care
of the rest on your own.

143
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,390
Hooray!

144
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,725
I'm nice to you, aren't I?

145
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,394
Yeah, you're the best!

146
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,731
Well, first will be Vegeta,

147
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,562
second will be...

148
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,864
Those guys are a set.

149
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:54,175
All right, let's go!

150
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,015
Rock, paper, scissors!

151
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:00,643
Tie, go again! ... Tie, go again! ...

152
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:07,350
Couldn't we get away now?

153
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:22,039
Hooray! I get Vegeta!

154
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,375
D- damn it!

155
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,378
Cheer up. It's better than him
not getting killed at all.

156
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:31,178
Understand, that's how it goes.
But I'll let you strike the finishing blow.

157
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:43,986
Now Freeza-<i>sama</i> will be able
to gain youth immortal.

158
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,668
I won't let you have them!

159
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,671
Stop! Don't waste your energy!

160
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,905
Right now, concentrate only
on defeating <i>these</i> guys,

161
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:58,500
instead of worrying about him,
you idiot!

162
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:03,437
Hey, come here a minute.

163
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,414
Oh, oh, a strategy meeting, huh?

164
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:14,959
That Ghurd guy that you'll be fighting
has a low battle power,

165
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,028
but he uses supernatural abilities.

166
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,393
Don't let your guard down.

167
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:21,253
Yeah.

168
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:26,704
By the way, is Kakarrot really
not here on this planet?

169
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:30,274
No, he's not.
But he is headed here.

170
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:33,377
Hurry and get here!
He may be an infuriating bastard,

171
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:36,005
but if we can get another ally,
it will add some to our potential for battle.

172
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,990
<i>Why in the world did we even</i>
<i>come here to this faraway place?</i>

173
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,292
<i>Far from being able to get</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls together,</i>

174
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:52,353
<i>we're instead letting the bad guys</i>
<i>get eternal life! Darn it!</i>

175
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:10,014
Huh? This is disappointing, huh?
Ghurd, you go first.

176
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:14,351
Tch... What am I, some kind
of battlefield garbage-collector?

177
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:18,913
What can I do? But ReaCoom, make sure
you really save some for me!

178
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,082
They're the same ludicrous bunch as ever!

179
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:28,028
Gohan, remember the image
training we did on the spaceship.

180
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,933
This looks like it's going
to be over in no time.

181
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,198
All right, let's go!

182
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,378
Release your <i>Ki</i>!

183
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:58,219
What's this?

184
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,405
<i>A full-power leadoff attack...</i>

185
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:13,536
<i>A fierce, all-out battle, the likes of which</i>
<i>had not been seen before, had begun at last.</i>

186
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:24,536
