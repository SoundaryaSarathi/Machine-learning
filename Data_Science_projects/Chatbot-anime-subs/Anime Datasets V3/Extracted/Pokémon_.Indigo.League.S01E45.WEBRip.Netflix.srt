Hey, look. A poster! "Missing."

16
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,079
- Is that...?
- It looks like.

17
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,247
It can’t be.

18
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,332
[all] James?

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,801
Wow! It sure looks like James.

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,056
Have you seen the boy in that photo?

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,684
We have if he’s James from Team Rocket.

22
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,145
Jolly good. Eureka.

23
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,479
Quick, to the estate.

24
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,897
[all] Hey!

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,865
Hmm, this kid looks a lot like you.

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,035
You think so? He looks pathetic.

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,289
- That’s what she means, James.
- Right! We'd better go investigate.

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,125
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,628
- James.
- What you waiting for?

30
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,130
-Oh, I’ll stay here.
-[both] No, you won’t.

31
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,673
[James groans]

32
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,890
[Ash] Hey, mister,
how much farther is this place?

33
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,975
We’re almost at the end of the driveway.

34
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,687
Seems like we drove past the main gate
about half an hour ago.

35
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,814
- Whoa!
-[Brock] Huh?

36
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,817
-Look at that.
-It’s huge.

37
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,613
Mm-hm. I’ve seen shopping malls
smaller than this place.

38
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,914
-[all] wow!
-[Misty] It must have 100 rooms.

39
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,166
It’s the biggest mansion I’ve ever seen.

40
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,710
-[man] That is not the mansion!
-[all groan]

41
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,839
This little dog house is for Growlie,
the favorite Pokémon of Master James.

42
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,007
[all] Huh?

43
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,177
[man] Behind you there, that building
is the master’s mansion.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,304
[all] Whoa.

45
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,474
Please, follow me.

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,310
[all gasp]

47
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,358
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

48
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,693
We’re in the lap of luxury.

49
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,072
[both] Yay! We hit the jackpot.

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,913
[all] Oh. Huh?

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,377
Coffins? Was there a funeral here?

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,132
My master and mistress had only one child,
a boy named James.

53
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,844
This morning, his parents passed away
and this estate is now his.

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,804
[all gasp]

55
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,307
[Ash] You mean that this whole estate
is going to belong to James.

56
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,853
-Ah! James!
-Is this place really yours?

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,271
I suppose.

58
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,567
It’s so frightfully tragic.
After Master James ran away,

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,695
his parents no longer
had the strength to go on.

60
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,321
Their hearts were broken.

61
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,323
That’s so sad.

62
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,744
And now they’re... I hope you find
James to tell him real soon.

63
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,454
-Real soon won’t do.
-[all scream]

64
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,414
His parents’ will clearly states

65
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,960
that Master James must marry his fiancé
within 24 hours of their passing away.

66
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,255
If not, this entire estate will
no longer belong to him

67
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,426
but will be donated to charity.
I must find him at once.

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,095
[Ash] We should help look for James.

69
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,057
What? why should we help him
after all the trouble he’s caused us?

70
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,435
He may want to come
to his parents’ funeral.

71
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,688
I mean, it’s his last chance
to say good bye to them.

72
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,607
Gee, I didn’t think of that.

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,650
But we’ll never find him in just one day.

74
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,278
-[James] No. Never!
-[Jessie] Careful, James!

75
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,489
[all] Whoa!

76
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,948
[all groan]

77
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,701
[shouting and arguing]

78
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,704
Stop that.
James’s parents just passed away.

79
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,500
-He’s got to come to their funeral.
-Never!

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,461
Uh, uh.

81
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,923
Look, James, we’re becoming
very annoyed with you.

82
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,926
Don’t you want to become
the richest guy in the world?

83
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,969
I don’t know.

84
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh! I feel like my head is splitting!

85
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,891
I can’t remember anything
that’s happened!

86
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,144
-What’s wrong?
-Maybe James has amnesia.

87
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,271
It’s all a blur to me.

88
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,651
I remember flunking out of Pokémon Tech
and joining a bicycle gang.

89
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,821
I only remember one scene before that.

90
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,698
It was a dark and stormy night.

91
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:28,537
A boy was wandering far from home
with his loyal Growlithe, Growlie.

92
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,708
They were both freezing
and they hadn’t eaten in days.

93
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,382
Ah. Growlie. I’m not going make it.

94
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,426
Leave me alone and save yourself. Oh.

95
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,229
The angels have come for me.

96
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,358
Farewell. I leave this cruel world
for a better place.

97
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:03,530
-Remember me, Grow... [grunts]
-Growlie.

98
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,117
[howls]

99
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,582
Then the boy departed this world.

100
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,875
Little Growlie howled all night.

101
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,214
-The boy was found frozen solid.
-Oh, that’s such a sad ending.

102
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,051
-That poor kid.
-I can’t believe James is gone.

103
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,970
-I miss him.
-Pika.

104
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,889
Hmm. James is standing right here!

105
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,727
Ah, that’s right. Huh? Hmm?

106
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,354
I’m all mixed up!

107
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,734
Who cares? It doesn’t matter
what you remember. Just take the cash.

108
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,697
But James can’t get his inheritance unless
he marries some girl in the next 24 hours.

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,824
We’ll fake a wedding
and scram with the money.

110
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,410
-That’s ridiculous.
-Ridiculous?

111
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,704
Ah. This entire estate will be all yours.

112
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,499
-Yeah! Yeah!
-I won’t do it!

113
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,169
-He’s weakening.
-He’ll see it our way.

114
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,131
Ugh! Let me go. I don’t want to.

115
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,591
You can’t make him get married.

116
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,719
He should be free to decide
who he does or doesn’t want to marry.

117
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,181
-Put a sock in it.
-Keep your dumb opinions to yourselves.

118
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,933
[all sigh]

119
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,811
-Pikachu!
-This is great.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,856
These invisible costumes are perfect.

121
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,859
[man] Yes? Coming.

122
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,195
They won’t fool that butler.

123
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,866
-May I help you, sir?
-It’s me, James. I’ve come back.

124
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,036
-Welcome home, sir!
-all] Whoa.

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,456
Your parents shall be most pleased
to see that you have returned.

126
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,042
-Please come in.
-[Jessie] Thank you.

127
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,127
[all] Huh?

128
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,714
-They wouldn’t have fooled me.
-[man] Everything is fine now, masters.

129
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,468
Your little boy James has finally
returned home just as you wished.

130
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:54,474
Oh, Mommy, Daddy. It’s true. I’m back
home at long last to get my money.

131
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,435
-Huh?
-Uh, I mean....

132
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,187
You’re blowing it.

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,524
I’m going to get married,
just like it says in your will.

134
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,318
-And I want cash, not a check.
-What’s that?

135
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,780
-I mean, I’m only joking. Of course.
-[all gasp]

136
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,784
Oh, Mom and Dad.
I wish I’d come back sooner.

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,829
-[ghosts chuckle]
-Huh?

138
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,751
-Hey, who’s that?
-Prepare for trouble.

139
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,212
-Yes, dear, and make it double.
-But they’re...

140
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,923
They’re ghosts!

141
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,966
[all groan]

142
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,094
Oh, James dear, we’re so happy
you’ve come back home.

143
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,679
And you’re wearing a suit.

144
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,807
-They’re either alive...
-Or they’re real solid ghosts.

145
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,184
They aren’t ghosts, you furry imbecile.

146
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,896
It’s just like them to pull a stunt
like this to get me to come back home.

147
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,150
-Does that mean...
-You really don’t have amnesia?

148
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,652
Huh? Who am I? Where am I?

149
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,488
Why, you’re James
and you’re about to be married.

150
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,451
-Hopkins, begin the preparations.
-Yes.

151
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,371
-I’ve got to escape.
-Oh, no, James.

152
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,622
You’re tying the knot.

153
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,375
[Meowth]
Ha, Jessie means you’re tying the noose.

154
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,711
[both chuckle]

155
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,176
So this whole thing was a trap
so James would get married.

156
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,096
-[all groan]
-I’m proud of you.

157
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,224
You realized you must uphold
the family tradition.

158
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,269
As our son and heir,
you have certain obligations.

159
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,731
The most important of these is to marry
and to continue the family line.

160
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,193
-Right.
-Do I have a duty to be manipulated?

161
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,195
[Dad]
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

162
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,656
[Mom] We only want what’s best for us.
I mean, best for you.

163
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,244
A man who can’t settle down is like
a bumblebee without a nose.

164
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,497
He’ll never sniff the daffodils of life.

165
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,334
You’ll learn to be a real gentleman
once you marry the right girl.

166
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,295
-And here she is.
-[both] Huh?

167
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,472
As James’s wife, it will be your duty

168
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,392
to change him from a worthless do
nothing into a respectable gentleman,

169
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,854
-my dear Jessebelle.
-As you wish, mother.

170
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:10,401
Meowth! Her voice is catnip to my ears.
Now, that’s what I call a real lady,

171
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,822
not a tough, mean, nasty girl
like Jessie. Ow!

172
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,282
I’ll show you tough, mean and nasty.

173
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,409
My name’s Jessebelle.

174
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,621
My only wish is to be your devoted
and loving wife

175
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,624
and companion and also

176
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:29,796
to educate you in your duties
as a gentleman of property.

177
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,257
[all] Whoa!

178
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,761
-She looks like Jessie!
-[groans]

179
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,142
Amazing. That girl looks just like Jessie.

180
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,395
-How dare you compare me to that wimp?
-Are you kidding?

181
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,439
-You both have exactly the same face.
-We do not.

182
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:52,277
Will you stop arguing?
We’ve got to get out of here right now.

183
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,653
Don’t be ridiculous.

184
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,406
How can we get your inheritance
if you don’t get married?

185
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,866
You’ve got to go through with it.

186
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,743
If you won’t get married for yourself,
then do it for the team.

187
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,621
We’re counting on you
to make us all filthy stinking rich.

188
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,583
Forget the team! I’m not doing it!

189
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,251
-I’m not.
-Is something wrong?

190
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,045
Why ever do you keep talking
to yourself like that, James?

191
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,839
Talking to yourself?

192
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,009
Meowth and Jessie are right in front
of their eyes and nobody notices.

193
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,178
Say, here’s an idea.

194
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,682
Let’s go down to the vault
and count all the money you’ll inherit.

195
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,767
[Jessie and Meowth chuckle]

196
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,856
After you disappeared, your mother
and father were so worried about you,

197
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,232
as I was, of course.

198
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,527
But I knew one day
you’d come back to me.

199
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,656
I’m sorry for running away,
but everything is going to be just fine

200
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,533
now that I’m back here
with my money.

201
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,912
-What?
-I mean back here with you. [chuckles]

202
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,208
Here we are at the vault.
Let’s go inside.

203
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,045
Your inheritance is in here.

204
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,340
-Ah.
-Ah.

205
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,716
Cha-ching!

206
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,555
-Huh?
-Bah uh? What’s all this junk?

207
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,349
What kind of inheritance is this?

208
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,060
It’s looks like
a lot of weird gym equipment.

209
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,978
Don’t you fools get it?

210
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,397
Jessebelle tricked you two
into coming down here.

211
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,692
-Huh?
-How did she spot us?

212
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,694
Imbeciles!

213
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,907
Your mother and I are tired
of waiting for you to grow up.

214
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,409
[all] Huh? [gasping]

215
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,871
James, it’s time to face the music.

216
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,752
You can’t just do whatever
you feel like anymore.

217
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,506
Now you’ll obey Jessebelle.

218
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,469
-Let the taming begin.
-[all] Oh.

219
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,932
I’m starting to like you more
than her, Jess.

220
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,144
Thanks for the compliment.
Hey, get off my head.

221
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,437
[both gasp]

222
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,189
They see us.

223
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,401
Everything was fine until you opened
that big Meowth of yours.

224
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,111
Do you take us for fools?

225
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,240
We just ignored you until you brought
James down here to the dungeon.

226
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,034
-Now you see us...
-And now you don’t.

227
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,329
[all cough]

228
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:13,292
Jessie, Meowth. Don’t leave me.
Ooh! Ooh!

229
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,215
-At last we’re together. I’m so happy.
-Eee! Ah!

230
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,468
-You won’t escape from me again, James.
-[groans]

231
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,595
[grunting and groaning]

232
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,852
Those two were made for one another,
just like you and I, my precious.

233
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,353
It’s a perfect match.

234
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:37,150
If you two weren’t such lousy parents,
you’d stop this mad woman.

235
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,027
Shouldn’t we try to help him?

236
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,571
I don’t like to get involved
in these little family squabbles.

237
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,826
Oh, James,
I just knew you’d fall for me.

238
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,621
-I choose you, Vileplume!
-Vileplume.

239
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,331
Hey, what’s that?

240
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,667
[Pokédex]
<i>Vileplume, the flower Pokémon.</i>

241
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,878
<i>Using the largest flower petals</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

242
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,298
<i>it spreads large clouds of pollen</i>
<i>that cause allergic reactions.</i>

243
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:06,012
Now Vileplume! Use your Stun Spore to slow
James down and keep him from escaping.

244
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,222
Vileplume.

245
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:13,644
Ah! This is just like this is just
like last time. Oh.

246
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,230
[all] Oh!

247
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,404
Heh. Sleeping like a baby.

248
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,869
James, my sweet, I’ll make a gentleman
out of you yet, even if it destroys us.

249
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,704
-Oh, Hopkins?
-Yes?

250
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,874
Would you please get a large broom
and sweep up this mess?

251
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,835
-Yes.
-[all] Whoa.

252
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,256
Ugh. Well, like they say,
even a rose has its thorns.

253
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,801
She’s more like a cactus.

254
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,053
If he marries her,
James gets his inheritance.

255
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,014
[grunting and groaning]

256
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,726
-If he survives being married to her.
-[growling]

257
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,895
[all gasp]

258
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,064
[growling]

259
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,482
Hey, what’s that?

260
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,240
-Pika, pi! Pikakaka pikaka pi!
-Huh? What’s it want?

261
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,243
It wants somebody to open
the door of that dog house.

262
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,704
Okay. Ugh. Oh, it’s locked.

263
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,166
-Come on. Give me a hand here.
-Sure, Ash!

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,294
[all grunting]

265
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,433
-Pika?
-What’s that?

266
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,393
[groaning]

267
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,104
James, it’s time for the wedding.

268
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,235
-Growlie!
-Growlie!

269
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,614
-Growlie!
-Oh, no!

270
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,533
Now, who let you in here?

271
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,537
-Vileplume, get rid of this horrid thing.
-Vileplume.

272
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,372
Run, Growlie!

273
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,667
-[grunts]
-Where are you going? Don’t leave.

274
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,544
-[grunts]
-Ruff! Ruff!

275
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,088
Growlie says to go inside.

276
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,263
I’ll follow you to the ends of the earth
and the bottom of the sea, James dearest.

277
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,476
Ugh. You saved me, Growlie.
Thank you.

278
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,561
-[pants] Growl! Growl!
-[laughs]

279
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,104
Oh! That tickles, Growlie.

280
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,609
Well, James, that fiancée
of yours is truly despicable.

281
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,861
Told you she’s just like Jessie.

282
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,071
I’ll make your mouth even bigger.

283
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,573
[sighs]

284
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,326
She’s the reason
I ran away from this estate.

285
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,369
What a rotten day.

286
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,665
As soon as my engagement to Jessebelle
was announced,

287
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,376
she began to follow me everywhere,
trying to change me.

288
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,712
Nothing I did was refined enough for her.

289
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,548
Please, leave me alone.
I can’t stand it.

290
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,384
Growlie?

291
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,261
Where are you going, James?

292
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,348
I haven’t finished teaching you
the correct way to eat spaghetti yet.

293
00:16:55,431 --> 00:17:00,520
-I want to do things my way, Jessebelle!
-You’re not running properly.

294
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,772
Let me show you the right way.

295
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
Ever since I was a kid,

296
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,694
I hated how upper class society
had rules for absolutely everything.

297
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:13,491
Jessebelle is so rigid, marrying her would
be the worst mistake of my life.

298
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,745
Growlie is my only real friend
on this stuffy estate.

299
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,121
Mm hmm.

300
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,208
I always wondered what it would
be like to grow up in a place like this.

301
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,503
Who would’ve thought being rich
could be such a bummer?

302
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,715
-What’s that?
-[all groan]

303
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,758
Now what?

304
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,553
My sweet James,
you can’t escape me.

305
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,013
Leave me alone.

306
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,893
Vileplume!
Stun them to sleep just like before.

307
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,729
-Vileplume.
-[all] Oh!

308
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:48,067
-Now, Pikachu! Electric Shock!
-Pikachu!

309
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,778
[grunting and groaning]

310
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,745
Keep away from me, you horrid beast!

311
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,836
-You’re the best. Thank you.
-Rowr! [barks]

312
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,258
It’s lunchtime in the pond.
Are you hungry, my friends?

313
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,761
-Oh, look! Jessebelle.
-Jessebelle.

314
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,556
Oh, what a refined daughter
in law she’ll be.

315
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,225
-[all] Ah!
-I’m leaving!

316
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,355
-I can’t stand that Growlie!
-She’s as delicate as a flower.

317
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,066
She’s much too good
for our delinquent son.

318
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,031
Well, Growlie, please take
good care of my parents.

319
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,285
They need you here. This upper
crush high life doesn’t suit me.

320
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,579
I’m better living the low life
with Team Rocket.

321
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,290
-Plus I like my freedom.
-Growl.

322
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,252
Please don’t cry, Growlie.
It’s hard enough to leave you.

323
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,133
-So long, Growlie.
-Rowl.

324
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:06,646
Oh, well, guess James chose to hang up
his Team Rocket costume.

325
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:12,193
Eh, I guess all that money and luxury was
just too tempting for James to give up.

326
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,029
I guess you’re right.

327
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,949
-[James] Prepared for trouble?
-Hey, it’s him!

328
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,451
James?

329
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,455
Make it double.

330
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,540
[chuckles]

331
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,459
[both grunt]

332
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,963
I guess we’re not going
to get rich this time either.

333
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,883
Guess not.
They wouldn’t give me the inheritance.

334
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,718
Oh, there’s always next time.

335
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:42,306
We may not make a lot of money,
but we sure have got our freedom!

336
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,393
Yeah. Double trouble time, right?

337
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,311
Sounds great to me, James.

338
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,072
Hey, wait!
You forgot Meowth again!

340
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:04,120
Oh, please, won’t y’all help me
find my beloved James?

341
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
Believe me, miss,

342
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,415
-he’s the one who finds us.
-Pikachu!
