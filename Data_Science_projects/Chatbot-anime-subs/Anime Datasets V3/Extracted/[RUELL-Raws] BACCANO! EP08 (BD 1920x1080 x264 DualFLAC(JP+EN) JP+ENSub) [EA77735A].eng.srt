1
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,904
Instead, let's come up with some
amazing gift, and go to New York!

2
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,449
It's all-out war...

3
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,868
...with the Russo Family...

4
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:26,296
Incredible!

5
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,621
All right then, gentlemen,
allow me to introduce to you,

6
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:03,624
from the FBI, special investigators
Bill Sullivan, and Donald Brown.

7
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,568
It's a pleasure.

8
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:05,544
Yeah.

9
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:06,461
It's a pleasure.

10
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:10,174
These two are pursuing suspects
in a string of robberies

11
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:13,424
that have taken place over several states.

12
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,817
They have struck more than 80 times now,

13
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:19,099
and I have pledged
the whole force's cooperation.

14
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,939
These are photos of the robbers.

15
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:34,072
Next.

16
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:38,869
Next.

17
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:42,541
Next.

18
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,541
Chief...

19
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,528
What is it?

20
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,557
Are you pulling our legs?

21
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,211
An understandable question,

22
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,294
but it's these two
who are doing the goofing around.

23
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,214
Chief...

24
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,123
What is it?

25
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:54,248
If they have turned up in all of these photos,

26
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,178
why hasn't anyone
been able to arrest them?

27
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,168
An understandable question,

28
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:01,058
but I will ask Mr. Sullivan to explain.

29
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:06,928
These are all photos that
local people happened to shoot of them

30
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,982
because of their eccentric outfits.

31
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:12,762
Generally, they did not realize
that they were robbers

32
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,905
until after the pictures were taken.

33
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,978
All of their crimes up to
now have been petty offenses,

34
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:21,482
not serious enough to get
them on our wanted lists.

35
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,664
Watches, chocolates, candy, and...

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,961
They once stole the door to an art museum.

37
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:28,668
In that case,

38
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:32,333
wouldn't it be quicker to have
their mamas chew them out?

39
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,788
I'm afraid we can't settle for just that.

40
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,511
The pair have made off
with the entire inheritance

41
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:41,431
of the New Jersey millionaire, Mr. Genoard.

42
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,560
Chief...

43
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,145
What is it?

44
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,398
What could have suddenly come over them?

45
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:54,027
An understandable question,
but if you ask me, I have no answer.

46
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,863
You can ask them yourselves.

47
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,028
Oh, crap!

48
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:09,459
Miria! We've forgotten
something awfully important!

49
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,251
What's that?

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,089
Ennis's... Ennis's...

51
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,721
W-W-What do we do?

52
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,471
What are we going to do?!

53
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,054
Isaac!

54
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,433
Miria!

55
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:30,313
--We forgot to buy a gift for Ennis!!
--We forgot to buy a gift for Ennis!!

56
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,325
Hey, guys.

57
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,908
There's something up on the forward coupling.

58
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:43,869
Ready, set...

59
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,458
The Rail Tracer?

60
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,738
I don't see it anymore.

61
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:53,795
Let's go.

62
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,511
Maybe...

63
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,054
Let's go up and see.

64
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,048
Donny, you head up the aisle down there,

65
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,851
and wait for us one coupling ahead.

66
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,937
You can count on me.

67
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,691
Be especially careful about the black suits.

68
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,357
Yeah.

69
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,567
Let's go!

70
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:26,953
Boss, you get the feeling
that Jacuzzi is all worked up?

71
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,041
He hasn't been like this since

72
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,875
those eight were killed by the Russo Family.

73
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:35,211
He was amazing back then,
even as he was crying, huh?

74
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,547
I wonder how far he'll go this time.

75
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,820
I am Gustavo Baggetta, of the Runorata Family.

76
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,642
We may have been rough with you,

77
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:06,826
but relax, we have no plans to take your life.

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,125
Runorata... I've heard that name before.

79
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:17,587
Your granddad, father, and brother
were all good friends with our boss.

80
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,261
Why are you doing this?

81
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,998
We have business with your other brother.

82
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,391
With Big Brother Dallas?

83
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,735
Your Big Brother Dallas
has done something naughty.

84
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:36,022
We have to tell him off,
but we have no idea where he is.

85
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,401
So, we're going to hold you hostage.

86
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,722
It's our way of calling the bastard out.

87
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:44,864
You're going to stay with us
for a while, like it or not.

88
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,119
You scared?

89
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:52,956
You're scared, aren't you?

90
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:02,007
You're a strong-willed little lady.

91
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:06,122
You want me to tell you
what kind of mischief your brother got into?

92
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:10,628
He's blackmailing us.
He says that your father and brother...

93
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:12,252
...were killed by us!

94
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:17,147
Is that true? Did you really
kill my father and Geoffrey?!

95
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:19,274
I'm not telling.

96
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,638
Are you really related to
that good-for-nothing father

97
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:27,927
and good-for-nothing brother of yours?

98
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,648
If they'd had
the strength of will that you have,

99
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:34,414
they might have lived another five minutes.

100
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:37,667
Whoops, that just slipped out.

101
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:44,424
God is going to punish people like you.

102
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,301
God, huh?

103
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:50,141
The people with the power prevail.
Such is the law of this world.

104
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,181
That's not true!

105
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,576
Big Brother Dallas...

106
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,902
Hey, Miria...

107
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,584
What, Isaac?

108
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:20,834
She's crying.

109
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,334
She's crying, huh?

110
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,964
She's looking at the picture and crying.

111
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,038
Photography.

112
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,841
It must be her lover.

113
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,578
Romance.

114
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,844
They were lovey-dovey.

115
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,157
Lovey-dovey.

116
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:36,212
I wonder if they've been separated for life.

117
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:39,562
I'm sure it must have been
an incredibly sad farewell.

118
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,392
Or maybe, they've been separated by death.

119
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:50,892
How tragic.

120
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,075
Um...

121
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:56,621
How did you know?!

122
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,914
How could you tell?!

123
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,290
I could hear you.

124
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,544
What do we do, Miria?

125
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:04,461
She's a formidable opponent.

126
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,578
We are robbers!

127
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,133
Robbers!

128
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,301
She's laughing.

129
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,804
She's laughing, huh?

130
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:14,721
She was crying just a second ago.

131
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,458
It was an abrupt change, huh?

132
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,060
It's just, you two are so funny.

133
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,298
Then we have no choice.

134
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:23,148
No choice, huh?

135
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,802
Tell us all about your lover!

136
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:27,318
We'll be guidance counselors!

137
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,138
We'll give you good advice!

138
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:32,282
--We no tellum lie!
--We no tellum lie!

139
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:37,994
Well?

140
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,443
There were two lookouts.

141
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:42,834
Both of them had machine guns. And...

142
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:46,796
everyone who was
around us has disappeared.

143
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:52,123
Isaac-<i>san</i>, Miria-<i>san,</i>
Czes-<i>kun</i>, Mary-<i>chan</i>, Beriam-<i>san...</i>

144
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,636
They're all gone.

145
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,805
Oh, no...

146
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,057
They could have been taken somewhere.

147
00:09:58,683 --> 00:09:59,768
We have to find them.

148
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:06,191
Nice, you and Nick take the roof
and head to the dining car.

149
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,109
Donny, you're with me.

150
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,990
Nice, I'll be coming back here for sure,
so don't overdo anything.

151
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,544
--Eh? Your brother?!
--Eh? Your brother?!

152
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:26,362
Yes.

153
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:30,048
My Big Brother Dallas is
really very kind at heart.

154
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:36,012
But lately, he's been acting a little violent,
and doesn't come home much.

155
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:37,804
She says he's been violent.

156
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,264
A juvenile delinquent, huh?

157
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,308
But why?

158
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,394
Our family, you see, is wealthy.

159
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,382
That's good, isn't it?

160
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:46,731
It is good!

161
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,650
No, it isn't.

162
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,558
Perhaps because my family
has been so blessed,

163
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:54,058
people only keep superficial company with us,

164
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:57,158
and what they say and what they think
are two separate things.

165
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,068
We saw a lot of things
that we didn't want to,

166
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,706
and that's probably why my brother...

167
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,584
That's a hard one, huh?

168
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:06,908
A real poser.

169
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,072
What should she do?

170
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:10,742
If that's the case,
what if you weren't rich anymore?

171
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,868
If that happened, you wouldn't
have to see that icky stuff anymore!

172
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,261
That was simple!

173
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,385
All right!

174
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,384
Excuse us a minute.

175
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,096
Excuse us.

176
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,432
--Keep excusing us.
--Keep excusing us.

177
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,232
What is the meaning of this, Miria?

178
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:46,430
It's a mystery, huh?

179
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,501
Is it the Rail Tracer?

180
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:51,462
It's a horror!

181
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:53,538
Where is Jacuzzi?

182
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,843
What do we do?
What if he's already been eaten?

183
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,845
I-It's all right, I tell you!

184
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,471
Since his body isn't here,

185
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:04,128
it could mean that he was
swallowed up by the monster.

186
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,724
That means he's still alive
inside its stomach.

187
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,981
He was swallowed whole, then?
Ah, thank goodness.

188
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,592
He was swallowed whole?!

189
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,734
Swallowed whole!

190
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,154
He's been gobbled up!

191
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:24,871
But, but, we don't know
where the guy who ate Jacuzzi is!

192
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:28,914
Yeah, that's okay.
As long as it's still aboard this train,

193
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,211
it means we're still together with Jacuzzi!

194
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,452
Mm-hmm... he still lives on in our hearts, huh?

195
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,277
Miria-<i>san</i>!

196
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:40,947
He really was a great guy... a great guy!

197
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:42,697
Are you all right?!

198
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,418
Jacuzzi, up in heaven, thank you.

199
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,947
Isaac-<i>san</i>!

200
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:51,314
Yeah, his voice, calling out to me like that...

201
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,485
is something I'll never be able to hear...

202
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,322
...again!

203
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,948
T-Thank goodness, you're both still safe!

204
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,687
W-We're glad <i>you're</i> safe, Jacuzzi!

205
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,715
You got out of its stomach, huh, Jacuzzi?

206
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,008
S-Stomach?

207
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:24,263
F-First thing we should do is
leave this room and go to the freight hold.

208
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,724
All right, let's go!

209
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,672
So that's it. I get you.

210
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,426
This train is now

211
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,678
"The Annals of the Three Kingdoms."

212
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,181
T-The Annals of the Three Kingdoms?

213
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,218
What are the Annals of the Three Kingdoms?

214
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:16,604
The Annals of the Three Kingdoms
is a famous history of China.

215
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,058
It's a story about these great samurai

216
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,903
who divide the land in three,
and feud with each other.

217
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:23,614
--Go on.
--Go on.

218
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,621
As I recall, they were
Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Hokusai.

219
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:32,942
They are often likened to
the snake, the slug, and the frog, huh?

220
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,167
Slug?

221
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,711
So you see, Jacuzzi, you have to be Yoshitsune!

222
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,591
Be him!

223
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,424
M-Me, be someone that great?

224
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,043
You can do it!

225
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,958
I-I was planning to make sure
all the passengers are saved,

226
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,767
and to defeat the black suits
and the Russo guys.

227
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:54,247
But I'm not all that outstanding a person.

228
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:58,497
I make liquor,
and just yesterday, I killed three men.

229
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,638
--Killed?!
--Killed?!

230
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:03,946
No! <i>We're</i> the ones who killed them!
It wasn't you, Jacuzzi!

231
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,615
It's the same difference.

232
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,620
We had eight of our friends
killed by the Russo Family.

233
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,720
--Killed?!
--Killed?!

234
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,698
S-So I lost my temper, and
robbed 18 of the Russo Family's shops.

235
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,158
E-Eighteen?!

236
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,032
That must have taken all month!

237
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,992
N-No, one day!

238
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,467
--One day?!
--One day?!

239
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,843
Jacuzzi was ten times
more fearsome than usual.

240
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:34,727
And he also cried a hundred times
more than usual.

241
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:38,481
I was out to avenge them,
but it turned out...

242
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:45,655
...I overdid things, and
more people ended up killed.

243
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:50,284
So I'm not some outstanding person.

244
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,288
Don't let it bother you!

245
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,152
Cao Cao and Yoshitsune
killed thousands, millions,

246
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:00,868
billions, and trillions of people!

247
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:03,952
Even so, if those around them said
they were great guys,

248
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:06,175
then that makes them great guys!

249
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,846
Well, I mean, you know...

250
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,962
You've got to live in the moment!

251
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,212
That's right!

252
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:20,678
So you see, Jacuzzi, we're
telling you that you're a great guy.

253
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,848
Don't miss out on that wave!

254
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,308
Even if someone is against you,

255
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:27,058
you've just got to let
yourself go with the flow!

256
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:29,808
Still, still, in order to make those waves,

257
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,062
you need to have at least
one of the people around you

258
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:35,898
think that you're a great guy.
We know you are!

259
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,500
So, we're making waves for you!

260
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,379
--Okay?
--Okay?

261
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,217
Thanks.

262
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,305
--How.
--How.

263
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:56,088
We're going to take all of the unhappiness
out of your home for you.

264
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:58,728
Then, the whole family will enjoy tranquility.

265
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,718
I'm sure your brother
will regain his footing.

266
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,024
He'll be rehabilitated!

267
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,762
--Bye.
--Bye.

268
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,098
U-Um...

269
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,614
That's right. What's your name?

270
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,075
Eve...

271
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,743
Eve Genoard.

272
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,247
Eve, I'm sure that you will find happiness!

273
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,750
Happiness?

274
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:22,585
--Bye.
--Bye.

275
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:41,103
--Bye.
--Bye.

276
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,342
Where are you going?

277
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,138
Why, to look for the Rail Tracer, of course.

278
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:50,313
We're going to ask it to leave this train.

279
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,614
What if that doesn't work?

280
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,467
--We'll beat it up!
--We'll beat it up!

281
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,117
What if that still doesn't work?

282
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,288
--We'll run and hide!
--We'll run and hide!

283
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,738
Huh?

284
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,818
The monster is sure to be strong.
You'll be killed.

285
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:04,965
No problem!

286
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,379
If it comes down to it...

287
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,219
I'll use my hundred-shot pistols.

288
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,847
You don't even have
a single-shot gun, do you?

289
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,642
Indeed I don't.

290
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,231
But you know what
gunmen of old used to say...

291
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,987
Everyone has a gun in their heart.

292
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,142
Don't go dying, now!

293
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,200
--Bye.
--Bye.

294
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:43,582
What a couple of willful,
do-as-you-please folks.

295
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,878
Those two are
much bigger bad guys than I am.

296
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,998
Let's go do a little as <i>we</i> please.

297
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,345
If we're going to do this,
let's be the biggest bad guys on the train!

298
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,016
Yeah. Sounds like fun, Jacuzzi.

299
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:04,718
That's the end of that, huh?

300
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:06,298
The end of that.

301
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:10,218
You know, this car looks just like
the one that hit us, huh?

302
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,402
Just like it, huh?

303
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,531
Um, actually...

304
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:15,531
--Huh?
--Huh?

305
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,688
Nothing, never mind.

306
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:21,495
By the way, miss,
where are you taking these guys?

307
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,875
To the police.

308
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,902
I see. Well then, this is goodbye.

309
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:28,948
That's too bad.

310
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,572
Is something the matter?

311
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:32,492
The police might be a bit, you know...

312
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:34,498
They would arrest us, and all.

313
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:39,292
Well, if I had to say, we're kind of
on a journey to redeem ourselves.

314
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:42,433
We're doing good things,
to make up for all the bad things we've done.

315
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:47,146
I see. You two are strong, aren't you?

316
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,052
Oh, yes, I'm strong!

317
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,651
I'm strong!

318
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:57,575
I'm so afraid to face my sins, I can't stand it.

319
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:01,494
What do you mean, miss?
Have you done something bad?

320
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,246
I've...

321
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,873
I don't know what might have happened,

322
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:14,618
but you just got done saving us, right?!

323
00:20:14,618 --> 00:20:16,868
So then, let's just call it even!

324
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:20,082
Mm-hmm! However many bad things
a bad person has done,

325
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:22,042
if they do one good thing,
everyone will think,

326
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:25,559
maybe they really <i>are</i>
a good person, after all!

327
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,133
--So, call it even!
--So, call it even!

328
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:28,938
--Okay?!
--Okay?!

329
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,942
T-Thanks...

330
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,432
I have to go now.

331
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:41,268
Yeah, okay. Oh, I'm Isaac Dian.

332
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:43,452
I'm Miria Harvent.

333
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,028
I-I'm Ennis. No last name.

334
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:52,238
You don't say? No last name, huh?
That's unusual.

335
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:55,578
We'll remember it. Ennis. Ennis, right?

336
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:57,118
Bye, now, Ennis!

337
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:58,467
Bye, now!

338
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,367
Hey!

339
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,588
See you later!

340
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:08,367
We'll see you later!

341
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,396
Bye-bye!

342
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:22,825
See you later.

343
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,789
Eve...

344
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:30,583
Eve...

345
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:41,748
Big Brother Dallas...

346
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:43,622
Sorry I've been away so long.

347
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:45,838
What do you say tonight,

348
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,934
I teach you some billiards or something,
for old time's sake?

349
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,271
Mm-hmm.

350
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:52,271
Oh, no!

351
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,021
We've been robbed!

352
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,314
I'll go see what it is.

353
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,192
Mm-hmm.

354
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,478
Stop that praying, will you?!

355
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:09,108
They say there's been a burglar.
I can't take this.

356
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,068
And here, I came home
for some spending money

357
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,862
because I'd inherited
something from Grandpa.

358
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:15,211
Big Brother...

359
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:19,131
You're a fool for believing in God!

360
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:07,460
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

361
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:21,724
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

362
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:33,318
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

363
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:40,322
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

364
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:47,372
<i>I believe so</i>

365
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:54,462
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

366
00:23:54,462 --> 00:24:01,968
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

367
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:08,688
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

368
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:18,740
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

369
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,051
<i>Hey, Isaac, who is Claire?</i>

370
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,538
<i>What do you mean, Miria?</i>
<i>You don't even know that?</i>

371
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,601
<i>Let's see..."carries out the mission..."</i>

372
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:34,974
<i>What's the matter, Isaac?</i>

373
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,720
<i>Well, you know, with a name like</i>
<i>"Claire, " she must be a woman, right?</i>

374
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,022
<i>Incredible</i>!
