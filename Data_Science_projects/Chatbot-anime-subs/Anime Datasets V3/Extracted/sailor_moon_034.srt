1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,401
I had no idea that obnoxious
guy was Tuxedo Mask.

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:09,841
And finally, Zoisite and
Tuxedo Mask face off!

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,211
Oh, what is going on?!

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,671
Anyway, the only thing I can do
right now is beat the bad guys.

5
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,449
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

8
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:08,312
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

9
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:35,772
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

13
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

14
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

15
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,402
In order to trick Tuxedo Mask,

16
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,734
Zoisite disguised himself
as a fake Sailor Moon.

17
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:03,867
We fell right into their trap
and into big trouble!

18
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:10,347
And Tuxedo Mask was injured, too!
It's just terrible!

19
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,387
Sailor Venus appeared, so we
managed to escape danger.

20
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,447
But is Sailor Venus really
the Moon Princess?

21
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,154
What will happen to us now?!

22
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:31,767
The Sparkling Silver Crystal!
The Moon Princess Appears

23
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,271
Sailor V, no, Sailor Venus...

24
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:45,417
By any chance, are you the princess?

25
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,418
No, I'm not.

26
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:50,322
Like you, I'm another warrior,
here to protect the princess.

27
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:51,523
I can't believe it.

28
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:54,292
My idol, Sailor V, is standing
right in front of me.

29
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,021
Nice to meet you, everyone.

30
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,896
Nice to meet you, too.

31
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,363
Nice to meet you.

32
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,871
By the way,

33
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm sorry to interrupt when we've
all finally come together,

34
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,043
but we're currently investigating
a certain area.

35
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:14,879
Let's get together tomorrow evening
at the Hikawa Shrine,

36
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,980
and I'll tell you the details then.

37
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,449
Then, see you later, Luna.

38
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,050
Okay. See you tomorrow.

39
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,847
Well, everyone, see you later!

40
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,155
She's gone.

41
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:25,924
She's rather impatient, isn't she?

42
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,755
But she's so cool!

43
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:34,061
Queen Beryl, why did you
order us to pull back?

44
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:37,135
We were so close to taking
the rainbow crystals

45
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,170
and finishing off Tuxedo Mask.

46
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,973
It was our great ruler's order!

47
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,565
Our great ruler's?

48
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,278
Our great ruler told me not
to kill Tuxedo Mask.

49
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,610
Instead, she demanded that
he be brought here alive.

50
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,016
What do you mean by that?!

51
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,280
Silence! Orders need
not be explained!

52
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,154
Understood.

53
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,971
Damn!

54
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:18,103
I could not protect her!

55
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:32,022
Sailor Moon.

56
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,072
What a wonderful room.

57
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,277
How did you find me?!

58
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:56,941
Once I found out who you were,
it was easy to find you.

59
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,383
My dear Mamoru.

60
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:02,253
What do you want?

61
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,623
Say, since we know who you are now,

62
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,023
why don't we just go ahead
and settle this?

63
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,828
Settle this?

64
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:14,322
That's right. We will fight for each
other's rainbow crystals.

65
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,827
Fair and square.

66
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:21,303
Sounds good. Okay, I'm in.

67
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,667
Good boy.

68
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,878
How about we meet at the skyscraper,

69
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,937
Star Light Tower in the Bay Area?

70
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,680
All right.

71
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:34,486
Then I will be waiting for you
at five this evening.

72
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:37,046
Good night, my dear Mamoru.

73
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:47,765
Juban Municipal Junior High School

74
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,502
Juban Municipal Junior High School
Okay, then I will see you tomorrow!

75
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:50,968
Juban Municipal Junior High School

76
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,005
It's already spring!

77
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,673
Everyone's waiting for me,

78
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:58,107
and she just had to pick today
to keep me behind!

79
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,468
Oh, Rei's gonna pick on me again!

80
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,880
You clumsy slowpoke! Moron! Retard!

81
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,918
That's...

82
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,587
What are you so depressed about?!

83
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,426
What's wrong?

84
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:19,419
Oh, dumpling head.
Perky as usual, I see.

85
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:26,033
Well, sorry! I can't help it if I'm perky
24/7, 365 days a year!

86
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,697
Keep it up and never change, okay?

87
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,946
Huh? What the heck? I don't
know how to react now.

88
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,810
What? It's blood. When did it...

89
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:47,925
Could he be... injured or something?

90
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,578
Dumpling head!

91
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,481
What are you doing?!

92
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,351
What about you?! What
are you doing here?!

93
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:17,655
I just came here because
I was worried about you.

94
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,122
Worried about me?

95
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,526
That injury of yours...

96
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,586
If you keep wandering around
like that, it'll never heal!

97
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,432
That's none of your business.

98
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:29,559
That's true, but...

99
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:31,735
Go on home!

100
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,475
You didn't have to say it like that!

101
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,070
Hey, wait! Hold on!

102
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,920
He's here!

103
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:52,757
Zoisite?!

104
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:53,458
No! What is this?!
Zoisite?!

105
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,425
No! What is this?!

106
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:55,927
I can't believe this!

107
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,062
You idiot! Why did you follow me?!

108
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,529
Because!

109
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,069
Hikawa Shrine

110
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,579
This is too late, even for
slowpoke Usagi.

111
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,614
They said she hasn't
been home either.

112
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,650
And she wasn't at school, too.

113
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,151
Even the communication device
isn't getting through!

114
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,953
Something's definitely wrong!

115
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,755
I have a bad feeling about this.

116
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,491
Anyway, we have to find Usagi!

117
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:27,992
She's at Star Light Tower!

118
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,459
What?

119
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,364
Who are you?

120
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,262
Did you forgot about us already?

121
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:43,039
Artemis! Then, you're Sailor Venus?

122
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,109
Normally, I go by Minako Aino.

123
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,878
I'm in the 8th grade
just like all of you.

124
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:48,713
According to our investigation,

125
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,949
the enemy seems to be up to
something at Star Light Tower.

126
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,786
If you cannot use the communication
devices, that must be it!

127
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:58,449
I bet Usagi just decided to
go there by herself!

128
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:04,090
If Usagi were that kind of girl,
I wouldn't have any problems.

129
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,126
Anyway, let's hurry to
Star Light Tower!

130
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,701
Okay!

131
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,309
Welcome.

132
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,947
I will leave our rainbow crystals here.

133
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,223
Now, hurry up and take
yours out, too.

134
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:35,026
Before that, please let this girl go.

135
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,654
After you take out your
rainbow crystals.

136
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,297
All right.

137
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,777
What is so funny?!

138
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:56,235
No, I'm just happy because
you're so dumb.

139
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:59,144
Shoot!

140
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:02,813
These rainbow crystals are mine now.

141
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,125
That's playing dirty!

142
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:11,824
Ah-ah. If you move now, that girl
will be burned to a crisp.

143
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,766
Zoisite, take care of the rest.

144
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:15,666
Yes.

145
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,267
Damn!
Yes.

146
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,131
Damn!

147
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:30,746
Zoisite... Why are he and Zoisite...

148
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:35,219
You scum! How dare you leave
a scar on my face?!

149
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,686
Just you remember this!

150
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:41,159
Mamoru Chiba, if you want the
rainbow crystals back,

151
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,394
come to the observation deck
at the top of the building!

152
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:47,455
Rainbow crystals? How does he know
about the rainbow crystals?

153
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:52,332
Now, please enjoy your fill of terror.

154
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,273
Watch out!

155
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,443
Run!

156
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:03,915
The injury on his shoulder...

157
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:07,285
Yesterday, Tuxedo Mask was also
injured in the shoulder.

158
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:08,775
He couldn't be, right?

159
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:14,321
Oh! I hate this!

160
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,590
Make it to the elevator!

161
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,617
Open, quick! Come on!

162
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:50,761
We're saved.

163
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,228
Not really.

164
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,423
Oh, no! What is this?!

165
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,336
It seems like we're trapped.

166
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:13,017
So, this is the Star Light Tower.

167
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,542
It looks like just another building.

168
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,563
Usagi and Mamoru are in the elevator.

169
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:26,364
What?!

170
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:27,064
What do you mean?!
What?!

171
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:27,798
What do you mean?!

172
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:30,596
All the doors are closed!

173
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,993
Meaning we can't get inside?

174
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:34,794
This isn't good.

175
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,575
My guardian, Jupiter!

176
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:41,136
Brew a storm! Call the cloud!
Bring down the lightning!

177
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,652
Supreme Thunder!

178
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,861
We'll just have to force
our way in! Let's go!

179
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,260
Right!

180
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,528
What a bunch of pests!

181
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,236
We have gotten a hold of
the rainbow crystals,

182
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,338
and Mamoru Chiba is as good as ours.

183
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:09,806
If I could finish off the sailor
warriors on top of that...

184
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,966
Go pay them back for what
he did to your face.

185
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,981
This elevator is taking so long.
It just keeps going up.

186
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:23,287
Hey, why were you talking about
the rainbow crystals?

187
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:27,417
Oh, sorry. If you don't want to talk
about it, that's all right, too.

188
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,516
I just wanted to recall my past.

189
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,296
Because, in order to get
my memories back,

190
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,931
I have to collect the rainbow crystals,

191
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:36,991
and get a hold of the legendary
Silver Crystal.

192
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,535
He even knows about
the Silver Crystal.

193
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:45,036
My parents were killed in a car
accident when I was six.

194
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,573
I'm sorry, but it was too
late for the couple.

195
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:53,883
But their only son, Mamoru,
has miraculously survived.

196
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,314
Who am I?

197
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:04,124
I don't know. Who... am I?

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,798
Ever since then, I have not been
able to remember anything.

199
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,868
Since then, I started seeing the same
dream over and over again.

200
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:23,843
The Silver Crystal... Please, the
legendary Silver Crystal...

201
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,718
I want to get a hold of
the Silver Crystal,

202
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:29,515
and get my past back.

203
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,525
Why did I just tell you all that?

204
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:42,264
I thought you were the most
obnoxious guy in the world,

205
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:48,664
but now, I'll move you up
to second place.

206
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,276
Thanks.

207
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:57,380
Tuxedo Mask?

208
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,682
No, that can't be! Right!
There's just no way!

209
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,688
Sailor warriors,

210
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:08,683
this is a worthy place
for you to die!

211
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,608
What's going on?

212
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,046
Sailor Venus!

213
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,159
Power outage?

214
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,671
Farewell.

215
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:00,810
What is it?!

216
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,451
What should I do? If I transform into
Sailor Moon, he'll know who I am.

217
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:10,614
But if I stay like this, we'll both die!

218
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:22,455
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

219
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,429
What?!

220
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,158
Sailor Moon?

221
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,088
I must report to Queen Beryl

222
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,691
that Mamoru Chiba was
killed in an accident.

223
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:21,992
What accident?!

224
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:23,459
What?!

225
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,263
For misleading everyone with
your cowardly tricks,

226
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:30,868
and for picking on us, I'm going
to make sure you pay!

227
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:35,464
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

228
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,576
Sailor Moon, I'll take care of you
along with Tuxedo Mask!

229
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:45,449
What are you talking about?! I don't
see Tuxedo Mask anywhere!

230
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,916
He's right here!

231
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:49,752
It couldn't be...

232
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,677
No way...

233
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,809
Study harder, dumpling head!

234
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,814
Crying will not solve anything!

235
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,482
The dumpling's turned
into puffed pastry!

236
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,288
Today, you are the star, Sailor Moon!

237
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,757
If you keep eating like that,
you'll turn into a meat bun!

238
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,889
Good-bye, Sailor Moon!

239
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,405
You're Tuxedo Mask...

240
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,865
You were very brave today.

241
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,939
Leave the rest to me.

242
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,070
I can't! Because you're injured!

243
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:53,913
I want you to run!

244
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:58,085
Sailor Moon, I will protect you!

245
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:00,656
Tuxedo Mask...

246
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:07,729
Enough with the games. Let's settle
this now, Tuxedo Mask.

247
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:09,833
Sounds good,

248
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,104
but you need to promise not to
lay a hand on Sailor Moon.

249
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:17,699
Of course! Let's fight fair and square!

250
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,411
Yes, fair and square.

251
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:30,980
Victory is mine!

252
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:56,043
Hang on! Hang in there!

253
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,683
Are you okay, Sailor Moon?

254
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:00,918
Yes.

255
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,052
Why do you look like you're
about to cry?

256
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,787
Why do you look like you're
about to cry?
Softly, listen closely

257
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,689
I'm glad you're safe...
Softly, listen closely

258
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:06,018
Softly, listen closely

259
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:07,358
Tuxedo Mask! Tuxedo Mask!

260
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,727
Tuxedo Mask! Tuxedo Mask!
The sweet sound of your breathing

261
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,218
The sweet sound of your breathing

262
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,265
Stand still and look carefully

263
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:16,400
We came too late!
Stand still and look carefully

264
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,201
The moonlight begins to
shine on your eyelids

265
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,769
Tuxedo Mask...
The moonlight begins to
shine on your eyelids

266
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,305
The moonlight begins to
shine on your eyelids

267
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,940
Tuxedo Mask!
The moonlight begins to
shine on your eyelids

268
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,204
The moonlight begins to
shine on your eyelids

269
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:32,038
Just by watching you sleep

270
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:38,414
I feel my heart being squeezed so

271
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:43,982
Releasing the seal on
the magic of night

272
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,024
Let us go in search

273
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,600
I've dreamed of it for so long

274
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,805
Just for you

275
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,107
The one and only

276
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,475
Where is it?
The one and only

277
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,842
Where is it?

278
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,416
The legendary sea

279
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,784
It's the Silver Crystal!
The legendary sea

280
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:07,451
So, that's the legendary Silver Crystal?
The legendary sea

281
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,146
So, that's the legendary Silver Crystal?

282
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,387
Quietly, it unleashes the light

283
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:19,329
The crystal of glass

284
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,864
The crystal of glass
Please have faith

285
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:21,265
Sailor Moon!
Please have faith

286
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:21,999
Sailor Moon!
When you have obtained love
Please have faith

287
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:22,800
What is going on?
When you have obtained love
Please have faith

288
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,801
What is going on?
When you have obtained love

289
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,361
When you have obtained love

290
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:31,642
That is the very moment

291
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:34,578
In your right hand

292
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:37,848
The crystal of glass

293
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,216
Begins to sparkle

294
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,952
Princess! The Moon Princess?!
Begins to sparkle

295
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,681
She has finally awakened.
Begins to sparkle

296
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:49,423
Now, embracing it for eternity

297
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:56,560
Moonlight

298
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:14,573
