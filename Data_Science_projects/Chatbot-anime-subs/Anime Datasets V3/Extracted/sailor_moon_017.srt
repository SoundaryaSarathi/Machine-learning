1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,504
You can't judge how beautiful a girl
really is by the way she looks.

2
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,273
You have to look at our hearts
and our love of justice.

3
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,764
If the photographer can't even
understand that...

4
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:19,712
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,007
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

6
00:00:55,007 --> 00:01:01,344
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

7
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

8
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

9
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

10
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

11
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

13
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
I believe in it, miracle romance

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,479
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

15
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:00,223
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

16
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,157
and fight against bad guys.

17
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,556
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:12,362
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

19
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,805
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

20
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:18,501
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

21
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,977
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

22
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:31,951
Is Usagi a Model?
The Focus of the Monster Camera

23
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:36,083
Lunch time! Lunch time!
It looks so good!

24
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,428
Let's eat!

25
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:41,090
Wow, they're so pretty! These are
wonderful photographs!

26
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:42,832
Wow, this is amazing!

27
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,301
These pictures were taken
by a junior high student!

28
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,568
Japan Picture Grand Prize
These pictures were taken
by a junior high student!

29
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:46,469
Japan Picture Grand Prize
I can't believe a junior
high school student

30
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,103
Japan Picture Grand Prize
Kijin Shinokawa
I can't believe a junior
high school student

31
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:49,039
Japan Picture Grand Prize
Kijin Shinokawa
received the highest honor
in Japanese Pictures.

32
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,806
Japan Picture Grand Prize
He must be a genius!

33
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:50,240
He must be a genius!

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,740
He must be a genius!
The young and talented photographer,
Kijin Shinokawa...

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,909
The young and talented photographer,
Kijin Shinokawa...

36
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,209
What?! No way! He goes to Gohongi
Number 1 Junior High School?!

37
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,849
X minus Y times pi R squared...

38
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,450
Ami! Big news! Big news!
X minus Y times pi R squared...

39
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,785
Ami! Big news! Big news!

40
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:02,986
Look, look, this boy!

41
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,921
He's a student at a school

42
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,490
near the T. A. School for Girls
that Rei goes to!

43
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,458
I know that.

44
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,127
This is no time to be acting so calm!

45
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:13,196
We have someone famous in the area!

46
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:16,188
Come on, let's go! Let's go together
to get his autograph!

47
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,301
I have cram school to
go to after school.

48
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:22,706
Sheesh, Ami! All you do is study!

49
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:25,975
You're wasting your precious youth.

50
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:28,910
Studying hard. That's what my
precious youth is about.

51
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:32,082
This is pointless.

52
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:34,150
Excuse me, please let me
take your picture.

53
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,811
Congratulations!

54
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:38,488
Please.

55
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,990
Mr. Shinokawa, can you
tell me how you feel

56
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,059
about receiving the highest honor
in Japanese Pictures?

57
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,127
I feel great!

58
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:46,730
So, will you keep taking more
scenic pictures?

59
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,129
Yes, sort of...

60
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,201
There he is! It's Kijin Shinokawa!

61
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,369
Kijin!

62
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,036
Stop it!

63
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:53,470
Gohongi Junior
High School

64
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,371
Gohongi Junior
High School
Rei...

65
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,872
Gohongi Junior
High School
Don't act like a groupie!

66
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:56,406
Don't act like a groupie!

67
00:03:56,406 --> 00:04:00,009
What?! What's wrong with asking for
an autograph from a celebrity?!

68
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,204
So, you can appreciate his art?

69
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,982
I'm just saying, if you're not
interested in photography,

70
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:10,687
don't make such a fuss just because a
famous photographer is in the area!

71
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,289
It's none of your business
who I ask for an autograph!

72
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,592
Excuse me, please stop.

73
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:16,025
Excuse me, please stop.

74
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:32,273
The evening light changes quickly.

75
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,173
Now's my chance!

76
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,184
Be careful.

77
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,550
Yes, thank you!

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,992
I'm a huge fan of yours.

79
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,528
I hope you keep up the good work!

80
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:03,136
Okay.

81
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:13,583
The stars know everything.

82
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,950
O Sirius, the star of evil shining
in the dark sky...

83
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:22,025
Kijin Shinokawa, whom
the star points to,

84
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:24,459
is about to attain his
highest energy level.

85
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,197
By photographing numerous
young women,

86
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:29,256
his energy level will increase.

87
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,063
Shinokawa

88
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,775
I can feel my imagination
getting really fired up!

89
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,578
Art is explosive!
I don't care who they are.

90
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:44,172
I just want to take explosive
pictures of girls!

91
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,347
The next model could be you!

92
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,418
You could be the next model
to be photographed

93
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:50,253
by the talented photographer,
Kijin Shinokawa!

94
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,881
Oh, I'd love to be photographed!

95
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:57,594
Hey, Usagi, we got a new
communication device!

96
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,459
I'm going to become a model!

97
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:02,322
I already gave Ami and Rei theirs.

98
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,836
Then I'll contact Ami and tell her
I'm going to be a model!

99
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,326
Oh, dear...

100
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,729
What is it, Usagi?

101
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:15,103
Guess what, Ami? I'm thinking
about becoming a model.

102
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:19,745
Usagi, you shouldn't use the
communication device like this!

103
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:24,844
Anyway, I'm in the middle of a
math problem right now. Sorry.

104
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:29,581
Oh, she hung up.
Fine, then, I'll talk to Rei!

105
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:34,264
I'm just saying, if you're not
interested in photography,

106
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:38,635
don't make such a fuss just because a
famous photographer is in the area!

107
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:42,002
She's going to make fun of me
if I call her. I just know it.

108
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,069
Forget it.

109
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,146
A model? With that face?!

110
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,082
What's your problem?!

111
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:53,783
There is no way!
What's your problem?!

112
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:54,817
There is no way!

113
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:59,923
Besides, you need more than
good looks and a good figure
to be a model.

114
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,624
You have to be smart, too!

115
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,693
I'll study hard from now on!

116
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:07,363
No way! You hate studying
and you're stupid, Usagi!

117
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:08,565
He'll just say,

118
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:08,965
Stupid
Rejected

119
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,533
Stupid
Rejected
"Sorry, you're not good enough!"

120
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:10,833
"Sorry, you're not good enough!"

121
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,836
Anyway, you'll just get disqualified
during the first selection stage

122
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,861
where you submit your photo.

123
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,736
Mom, Shingo's so mean to me!

124
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:24,343
Oh, but I think Shingo's
actually pretty right.

125
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:27,717
My family is so cruel.

126
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,550
Both my mom and kid brother
are merciless!

127
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:31,621
Crown

128
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:32,589
Crown
Cheer up, Usagi!

129
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:33,690
Cheer up, Usagi!

130
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,352
You should never give up
before you start!

131
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:40,154
The most important thing is
to challenge yourself!

132
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,930
You're the only one who
supports me, Motoki.

133
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,794
Motoki is right.

134
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:48,568
Well, you'll probably fail anyway,

135
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:52,175
but no matter the outcome, the
important thing is to participate.

136
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,700
I didn't ask for your opinion!

137
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,640
Both men and women have got
the wrong idea, lately.

138
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:03,146
They assume they've become beautiful,
if they pretty themselves up.

139
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:06,889
A girl's beauty isn't limited
to her looks.

140
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,992
Then what else counts?

141
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:11,728
It's what's inside! A kind heart

142
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:14,595
and the guts to carry out
what she thinks is right!

143
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:17,355
Guts? For a girl?

144
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:20,398
That's right!
Well, you don't have either, though.

145
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,463
Why, of course, I don't!

146
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,275
Besides, this guy just wants to
photograph young girls,

147
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,778
no matter who they are!

148
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:31,381
If that's his approach to photography,

149
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,616
this Kijin Shinokawa
must be a second...

150
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,852
no, he must be a
third-rate photographer.

151
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:38,685
That's enough! I don't even want
to see your face anymore!

152
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,897
Mamoru, she's a young lady. You
shouldn't treat her like a little kid.

153
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:49,999
I know that,

154
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:53,162
but we always end up fighting
every time we talk.

155
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,632
I guess we just don't get along.

156
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,987
Hey, what are you doing?

157
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,321
Well...

158
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,690
Oh! I know.

159
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,225
You're wondering if you got
an acceptance notice

160
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,527
from the first screening.

161
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:18,327
Eek!

162
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,929
You're so stupid!

163
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,398
I told you there's no way
you'll get accepted!

164
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,967
You got rejected during the photo
selection stage for sure!

165
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,730
Shut up! Go away!

166
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,805
Usagi, there's mail for you.

167
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:29,706
It's finally here!

168
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:31,674
It's probably just junk mail anyway.

169
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:36,679
I did it! I passed the first screening!

170
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,549
Look! It says to come to
New Japan Hotel tomorrow

171
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,245
because they're doing a
photo shoot by the pool!

172
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:43,553
Accepted
Acceptance Notice
Miss Usagi Tsukino
You have passed the first screening.
The photo shoot will be at the New
Japan Hotel on July 4th.
How about that?!

173
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:44,287
How about that?!

174
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:47,313
A-e-i-o-u!

175
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,859
Raw wheat, raw rice, raw eggs.

176
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,594
Usagi, what are you doing?

177
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,528
Practicing to be a model!

178
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:56,199
Don't ask me stupid questions!

179
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,168
I have to practice singing, too!

180
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,406
Rabbit, rabbit, what are you
looking at when you hop...

181
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,169
It sounds terrible!

182
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:09,178
I think this'll be the perfect dress
for tomorrow. Oh, yeah!

183
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,806
They said I need to bring a swimsuit.

184
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,172
I'm pretty sure it's in this drawer.

185
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:18,178
Moths ate into it and
it's full of holes!

186
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:20,849
New Japan Hotel

187
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,092
Kijin Shinokawa
Photo Session Hall

188
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,361
Wow! So many people!

189
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:34,303
Art is explosive!

190
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:37,704
Everyone, please go to your assigned
rooms and wait there!

191
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,644
I don't want to be disturbed while
I'm taking pictures, so don't peep!

192
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:42,278
Japan Pictures Winner
Kijin Shinokawa Photo Session
I don't want to be disturbed while
I'm taking pictures, so don't peep!

193
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,781
Japan Pictures Winner
Kijin Shinokawa Photo Session
Everyone come in at the
appointed time. Got it?!

194
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:45,615
Japan Pictures Winner
Kijin Shinokawa Photo Session
Yes!

195
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:45,982
Yes!

196
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,780
I have a bad feeling about this.

197
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:49,986
What do you mean?

198
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:53,156
Kijin Shinokawa is acting completely
different than before.

199
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:57,024
All artists tend to be a bit weird.

200
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,798
Besides, there's just something wrong
about you getting accepted.

201
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,366
Luna!

202
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,268
Oh, Usagi!

203
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,470
My, so you were accepted, too?

204
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,667
I can't believe this.
Both Naru and Ms. Haruna...

205
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:14,203
It's important for a model
to always smile.

206
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,844
Did I gain a little weight?

207
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:24,143
Hey, Usagi. You should also change
into your swimsuit soon.

208
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,489
Oh, yeah...

209
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,218
Didn't you bring one?

210
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,788
I'm already in it.

211
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,931
Then, why don't you take
your clothes off?

212
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:35,765
Yeah...
Then, why don't you take
your clothes off?

213
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:36,493
Yeah...

214
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,468
Oh, it's cute!

215
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:42,403
I tied ribbons in all the moth holes.

216
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,301
I still think something is fishy.

217
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,048
Art is explosive!

218
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,017
If I feel something, I get closer
and boom! Take the picture!

219
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:58,385
I'm such a genius when it comes
to taking pictures!

220
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,461
What's going on?!

221
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,557
All the girls...

222
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,460
Usagi, we're in trouble!

223
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,296
All the girls Kijin Shinokawa
photographed just disappeared!

224
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,831
What kind of nonsense is that?

225
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,232
I'm not kidding!

226
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:45,395
This must be one the
Dark Kingdom's evil plots!

227
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:47,838
Please contact Ami and Rei!

228
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:51,103
Oh, shush! I'm busy right now.

229
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,612
Oh, really? Then I'll tell everyone
about your swimsuit!

230
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,381
Okay, I get it!

231
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,683
Usagi, what did you get?

232
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:01,412
Oh, it's nothing!

233
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,410
I definitely gained weight.

234
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,493
Oh, Ami.

235
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:12,963
I'm at the New Japan Hotel for
a photo shoot right now.

236
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:14,598
Come see me in my moment of glory!

237
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,299
Wrong! Something's about to happen!
Come see me in my moment of glory!

238
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,900
Wrong! Something's about to happen!

239
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,502
Come here right away with Rei!

240
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,871
Usagi, it's our turn.

241
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,862
I have definitely gained weight!

242
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,741
Okay, let's go!

243
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:26,106
Wait!

244
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,478
Usagi!

245
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:30,002
Oh, no!

246
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:33,150
Luna, I'll never forgive you!

247
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,447
Come back here!

248
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:44,050
Hey! Stop right there, Luna!

249
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:53,531
Oh, I'm the only one that
won't be photographed.

250
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm a genius!

251
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:11,488
They disappeared!

252
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,156
I told you so!

253
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:15,386
This is terrible! Let's go, Luna!

254
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:24,199
Kijin, what did you do to everybody?

255
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:28,505
Art is self expression!
I don't care who she is.

256
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:32,305
I'm going to snap pictures of girls!
Boom! Boom!

257
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,240
You're wrong!

258
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,047
What did you say?

259
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,516
You don't care who it is, as long
as she's a young girl?

260
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:41,618
Anyone who takes photographs
with an attitude like that

261
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:43,420
is a third-rate photographer!

262
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,945
She's just repeating what Mamoru said!

263
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:48,191
You're supposed to be a photographer

264
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,027
who understands the
beauty in this world!

265
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,962
Please wake up!

266
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,156
Back off!

267
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,556
Ouch!

268
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,496
Are you okay, Usagi?

269
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:03,034
Now, transform into Sailor Moon!

270
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,433
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

271
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:50,011
You can't judge how beautiful a girl
really is by the way we look.

272
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,462
You have to look at our hearts
and our love of justice.

273
00:15:58,462 --> 00:15:59,952
Who are you?!

274
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:06,665
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

275
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:11,138
Monster, I know you've possessed
Kijin! Come out now!

276
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:14,738
Oh! You're beautiful!

277
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:20,383
You're being controlled by
a monster! At this rate,

278
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:25,878
all your passionate energy will
be taken by the monster!

279
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:33,061
Sailor Moon Kick!

280
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,463
Hang in there!

281
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:55,283
Sailor Moon. I am Cameran, and
Kijin's energy will be mine!

282
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:58,585
Take this!

283
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,662
No way!

284
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:08,832
Sailor Moon, be careful!
If Cameran takes your picture,

285
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,164
you'll be trapped inside
the photograph!

286
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,164
I don't wanna be trapped!

287
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,842
Watch out, Sailor Moon!

288
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,813
Oh, Luna! Where are you?!

289
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:29,885
She's right here.

290
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,454
Luna! Kijin!

291
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,455
You're terrible... You're terrible!

292
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:40,964
Sailor Moon.

293
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:46,368
I'll make sure to get you this time!
Take my shutter attack!

294
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:51,430
Stop right there!

295
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,968
Sailor Mercury! Sailor Mars!

296
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,606
Bubble

297
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,049
Spray!

298
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,792
Monster, I will seal your
evil powers away!

299
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,960
Begone, Evil Spirit
Monster, I will seal your
evil powers away!

300
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,260
Begone, Evil Spirit

301
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:17,325
Begone, Evil Spirit
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu,
Zai, Zen. Begone, evil spirit!

302
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:21,166
Impertinence! Such petty tricks
will not work on me!

303
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,177
What's going on?

304
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,614
Sailor Mercury! Sailor Mars!

305
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,755
I will get you now!

306
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:56,006
Sailor Moon, be careful!

307
00:18:56,006 --> 00:19:00,067
If Cameran takes your picture, you'll
be trapped inside the photograph!

308
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:04,740
If the camera captures you, you'll
be turned into a picture! Okay!

309
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,382
It's too late for you now!

310
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,118
What?!

311
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:24,290
I'm being trapped inside the camera?!
I cannot disappear!

312
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,532
Monster, Cameran, I won't forgive you!

313
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,150
What?!

314
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,677
Moon Tiara Action!

315
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,939
I've had enough of photo shoots!

316
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:19,018
The star of evil has disappeared.

317
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,721
Nephrite, it seems that
your plan has failed.

318
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,985
Who's there?

319
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:29,899
Zoisite?!

320
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:36,532
I am sure Queen Beryl will be very
happy to hear of your performance.

321
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:42,145
What about you? Have you found
the legendary Silver Crystal,

322
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:44,204
that will wake our great ruler?

323
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:50,514
You should properly fulfill your duties
rather than worry about others.

324
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:57,118
Countless beings possess energy
on this Earth! Countless!

325
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,365
Where is Usagi?

326
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:05,101
She locked herself in her room.

327
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:08,195
Maybe she made a fool of herself
at the photo session.

328
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:12,230
She's probably too embarrassed
to face us.

329
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,842
I have decided to stop taking
pictures for a while.

330
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:20,083
How come? When will you
start shooting again?

331
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,285
Someone taught me a lesson.

332
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:25,254
That a woman's true beauty is
not about how she looks.

333
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:29,292
It is about what's in her heart
and her love of justice.

334
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:32,228
When I truly understand
what that means,

335
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:34,856
I will take up my camera once again.

336
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:37,395
Someone taught you a lesson? Who?

337
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:40,297
A wonderful girl.

338
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,536
I wish Usagi would become a
wonderful girl like that, too.

339
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:46,142
I couldn't agree more.

340
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:49,305
That'd be impossible for stupid Usagi!

341
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:12,925
In my dream, you and I were together

342
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:19,837
Protected by the stars

343
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:35,055
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

344
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:42,193
And we casually talked to each other

345
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:50,971
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

346
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:57,939
I want to become prettier
right here and now

347
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:05,477
Something changes when
you fall in love

348
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:12,058
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

349
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:25,942
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
