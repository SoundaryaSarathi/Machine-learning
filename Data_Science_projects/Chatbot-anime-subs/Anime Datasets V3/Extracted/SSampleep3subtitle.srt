167
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,640
Haku-sama did this?</font></font>

168
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,360
! </font>Really surprised, for it is our Haku-sama</font></font>

169
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,110
! </font>Which if left can not put her underwear on their own</font></font>

170
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,030
! </font>Which does not have any interest at all the Academy</font></font>

171
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,450
... I grabbed his shirt and said</font></font>

172
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,620
"stay here"</font></font>

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,420
- This is not according to, and</font></font>

176
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,960
! </font>I've eaten before they come here</font></font>

178
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,180
But Haku-sama eat what regularly every day of the week right?</font></font>

179
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,720
"Today is Wednesday for this is the day," Skoppelas any neighbors</font></font>

! </font>Uh, not again, Kemeto-sama sees Bmaita again</font></font>

229
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,790
. </font>Do not tell me that this is the result of that technique shortly before</font></font>

230
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,330

235
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,860
! </font>Damn, at this point all you can do is stop it by force</font></font>

236
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,980
! </font>Sonhik</font></font>

237
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,490

Are you fine ?</font></font>

242
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,940
... How strong! </font>Do you say you are from the commoners!?</font></font>

243
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,480
Huh?</font></font>

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,900
. </font>Oh, I say that I am in the latter in the weak</font></font>

246
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,820
What are you ?</font></font>

247
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,990
Boycotted Karen, who invented unavailing against weaker commoners!?</font></font>

248
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,320
You Taatalim yourself, this stunning</font></font>

249
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,330
. </font>In fact, I'm not really the weakest</font></font>

250
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,580
! </font>Do not accept this! </font>I want to re-fencing</font></font>

251
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,620
one more time</font></font>

252
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,670
! </font>Soqtek and my name, which was re-Ttalkh</font></font>

Huh! </font>A-Wait a minute</font></font>

254
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,000
! </font>Behold, I am coming</font></font>

255
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,890
. </font>Impossible, I did not see the common man even attack</font></font>

256
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,390
. </font>Huh? </font>Most likely this is because you have done previously</font></font>

257
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,730
And you weaker!?</font></font>

258
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,020
"... terrible nights Fezaatkm Dear people" Amyin</font></font>

259
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,440
! </font>I told you I did not do anything that I've done for yourself</font></font>

260
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,820
... I did this for myself!?</font></font>

261
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,950
. </font>Right</font></font>

262
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,490
I understand ..</font></font>

263
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,240
Do you understand now?</font></font>

264
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,290
! </font>This is frustrating, you're in a completely different level</font></font>

265
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,200
! </font>No! </font>No! </font>No</font></font>

266
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,210
. </font>Okay</font></font>

267
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,840
. </font>I've overtaken, I admit you as sir</font></font>

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,800
What kind of monster callee you?</font></font>

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,720
! </font>But remember this! </font>At the moment, which will become the weakest me where I'll take your life</font></font>

270
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,770
What is the worst! </font>Tsthinin Bsiedk! </font>Dragon in the world of demons</font></font>

271
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:05,230
. </font>But even then, you can I use what suits you best</font></font>

272
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,030
. </font>I heard that he had made Karen servant by force</font></font>

273
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,620
! </font>Commoners do not really believe</font></font>

274
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,780
! </font>Here it is</font></font>

275
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,620
Hmm? </font>what is this !?</font></font>

276
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,410
! </font>My party's plan to become the most popular girl in the classroom</font></font>

277
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,590
... So this lousy person like me to call</font></font>

278
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,760
! </font>Can invite everyone without difficulty! </font>I am now quite strong</font></font>

279
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,090
! </font>What ? </font>Do not look too happy</font></font>

280
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,430
. </font>nothing</font></font>

281
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,520
Oh, then what do you think of my plan?</font></font>

282
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,060
. </font>Not a bad idea, but I think it's going to be tough</font></font>

283
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,110
. </font>Because you'll need a lot of mobile phones</font></font>

284
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,070
. </font>You can not provide this</font></font>

285
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,110
! </font>So do something in this matter</font></font>

286
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,950
! </font>Easy for you to say this</font></font>

287
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,910
. </font>It does not seem there is no way here to get setups Han</font></font>

288
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,120
. </font>This is possible</font></font>

289
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, true, do you have any Haku agreements with the development of smart phones?</font></font>

290
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,670
And I said that there is a group of such samples in your laboratory?</font></font>

291
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,510
. </font>Here you are, you're lucky</font></font>

292
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,010
... this is very good</font></font>

293
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,630
But when you sit so?</font></font>

294
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,680
. </font>Nothing I can do, it does not move</font></font>

295
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,220
! </font>You can certainly do something despite the appearance they are in middle school</font></font>

296
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,560
! </font>What you do is not true</font></font>

297
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,640
. </font>middle School ! </font>Here again you exaggerate</font></font>

298
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:33,230
Come on, Llano ... Haku-sama let us go and sit down on the pillow, okay?</font></font>

299
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,490
What do Ottaghdan yourself so!?</font></font>

300
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,620
! </font>I do not put myself</font></font>

301
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,830
. </font>Forgive me on this entry</font></font>

302
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,490
What do you need?</font></font>

303
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,710
- As I said earlier</font></font>

304
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,790
! </font>Kujurzaka! </font>What is the meaning of this small girl</font></font>

305
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,510
! </font>Not completely meaningless, yes, absolutely no sense, no sense, no sense never</font></font>

306
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,890
! </font>This is really meaningless</font></font>

307
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,270
So, when I came here?</font></font>

308
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,360
. </font>As I said earlier, I come to you now</font></font>

309
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,400
I will keep it up beside you as much as possible and</font></font>

310
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,240
. </font>At the moment I feel I am able to've beaten, I'll kill you</font></font>

311
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,580
Yes, this is the main goal, but not Tguetlina</font></font>

312
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,920
! </font>(B) I am having sent that thing which is incredible in my face as I did</font></font>

313
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,540
! </font>I did not draw anything</font></font>

314
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,880
! </font>A-Protect</font></font>

315
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,710
Are you here ?</font></font>

316
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,300
! </font>I was here all the time</font></font>

317
